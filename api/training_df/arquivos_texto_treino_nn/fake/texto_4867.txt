republicans like maine governor paul lepage like to scare people with stories of black drug dealers corrupting our communities  but their own presidential nominee once went to great lengths to make sure a convicted cocaine trafficker received a light prison sentence in   joseph weichselbaum was indicted for drug trafficking  but while the drug dealers under him were sentenced to serve  years in prison  weichselbaum only had to serve  months because donald trump stepped in as a friend and apparently pulled some strings  according to trump biographer david cay johnston during an appearance on cnn on saturday  johnston told host mike smerconish all about how trump met this cocaine trafficking creep  housed him  and protected him from getting the punishment he deserved  donald got his personal helicopter and the one for his casinos from a convicted felon who turned out to be a major drug trafficker  and instead of cutting ties with this guy  he kept him on  he rented him an apartment under very unusual circumstances as i described in the book   johnston said   he wrote a letter pleading for mercy for him  saying he was a stand up guy  the guy got  months while the people who actually delivered the drugs for him got  years  and  by the way  the case came before at one point judge maryanne trump barry   donald s older sister  this is the explosive story that could derail trump s already imploding campaign  and let s not forget that trump has said that he would consider his sister for the supreme court it s so explosive  in fact  that trump supporter betsy mccaughey didn t even bother to refute it  instead  she ignored it altogether and changed the subject by accusing hillary clinton of being a racist and claimed that trump would make sure american workers get a higher take home pay even though trump is supported by white supremacists and he fights constantly to make sure his workers can t unionize to fight for higher pay here s the video via youtube and it s not like johnston isn t a credible source either  he has covered donald trump for  years and is a pulitzer prize winning journalist  but you know that trump supporters are going to call him a hillary clinton pawn speaking of hillary clinton  conservatives have been attacking her for defending an accused rapist in arkansas in   but conservatives apparently need to be reminded that every person in this country has the right to a competent defense in court no matter what they did or are accused of doing  it s kinda like how founding father john adams defended the british soldiers who fired upon a crowd in boston in   and while hillary did not feel good about representing the alleged rapist  she was still obligated to do her job to the best of her ability after being assigned to the case by the judge  it s the prosecuting attorney s job to put defendants in jail and the prosecutor failed to do so  hillary cannot be faulted for being a better lawyer trump  however  was not obligated to associate himself with a drug trafficker  he did that voluntarily and continued to associate with weichselbaum even after he was convicted  going so far as to make an effort to get him a light sentence for his crimes apparently  trump s brand of  law and order  is that some defendants should be handicapped in court but if you re a friend of trump even a drug trafficker can escape justice after being duly convicted in a court of law  just imagine how many convicts could escape justice under a president trump who has the power to grant pardons featured image via getty images
