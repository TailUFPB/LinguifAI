conspiracy loving conservatives are once again all over last summer s murder of seth rich  a dnc staffer they believe leaked the dnc s emails to wikileaks rather than russia  they re yelling about it as loudly as they can because if it were true  then it would serve to demonstrate that there s no connection between trump s campaign and russia  this latest round of frothing over rich s death began when rod wheeler  a legal commentator at fox news  claimed he could confirm that rich leaked those emails during an appearance fox  d c  now rich s family is demanding that wheeler stop altogether  which should make others shut up too out of simple respect for them  but some don t seem to care rich s family sent a cease and desist letter to wheeler  threatening legal action if he continued to spew his conspiracy theories about rich s death  it seems  though  that sean hannity is either unaware of the family s wishes  or he just plain doesn t care  chances are  it s the latter  since he wants to continue telling himself that trump is his lord and savior and perfect in every way  he tweeted seth rich was murdered last year in what officials believe was a botched robbery  hannity has been screaming about it on twitter ever since wheeler claimed to  know  stuff on television  ignoring key facts and statements about the case is his desperation to prove that there was zero collusion between trump s campaign and russia rich s family blasted wheeler for his statements  as well they should  a sudden death in any family is exceptionally traumatic  they said  your statements and actions have caused  and continue to cause  the family severe mental anguish and emotional distress  your behavior appears to have been deliberate  intentional  outrageous  and in patent disregard of the agreement and the obvious damage and suffering it would cause the family your improper and unauthorized statements  many of which are false and have no basis in fact  have also injured the memory and reputation of seth rich and have defamed and injured the reputation and standing of the members of the family  hannity should be castigated for his insistence on pushing this conspiracy theory to his not insignificant twitter audience  as should newt gingrich and the fox news network for pushing it on the air  this story has repeatedly been debunked  and the family wants everyone to shut it and let rich rest in peace if the story were true  it might be easier to understand why the media wouldn t leave it alone against rich s family s wishes  but it s a vapid conspiracy that right wingers like hannity are pushing in a pathetic  desperate attempt to deflect attention away from the trump russia connection featured image by paul zimmerman via getty images
