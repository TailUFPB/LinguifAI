i guess trump missed the sticks and stones lesson in life as more and more of his critics are getting blocked on twitter over the tiniest things take  for example  rob szczerba s covfefe ice cream joke  according to cnn  szczerba tweeted trump    realdonaldtrump i heard  covfefe is a new flavor from ben   jerry s  but it s mostly just nuts  i heard  covfefe is a new flavor from ben   jerry s  but it s mostly just nuts   parisagreement  parisaccord  rob szczerba   rjszczerba  june    szczerba went to tweet trump again not long after  he found himself blocked by trump how sad is that  blocked because of a joke  rather than laugh off his own typo  trump would rather pout and block people lauren wolfe believes that blocking critics poses dangerous implications  when trump shuts out his critics  he withdraws further into the bubble of sycophancy he already enjoys   wolfe wrote in an opinion piece for cnn wolfe raises a valid point  as the old saying goes  if you can t handle the heat  get out of the kitchen  so  what is trump doing in the kitchen since trump shows no signs of stopping as the number of people he blocks on twitter grows  questions and concerns are on the rise  while some wear their blocked status proudly and couldn t care less  it raises first amendment concerns if tweets by trump  no matter how ridiculous they are  should they be inaccessible to certain people  after all  his tweets are meant to be treated as official white house statements the knight first amendment institute at columbia university says a lawsuit is not out of the question if trump doesn t unblock twitter users  your twitter account is a designated public forum for essentially the same reasons that open city council meetings and school board meetings are   the lawyers wrote in the letter a fair point  nobody deserves or should be exempt from what the president has to say on social media  trump is no longer a private citizen and his twitter account is also no longer personal to hide from others while hilariously sad that trump s blocking people  it just reinforces that everything is trump s way or the highway featured image via pete marovich bloomberg via getty images
