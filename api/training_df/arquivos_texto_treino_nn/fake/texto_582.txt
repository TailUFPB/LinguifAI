before dawn on wednesday  the feds raided the home of former donald trump campaign manager paul manafort  trump  as intelligence expert malcolm nance says  is getting buggy  the investigation is getting closer and closer to him  and his poll numbers are in a free fall  so from the safety of  day golf vacation in new jersey  trump is threatening war against not one  not two  but three countries most of the media has been covering his exchange of provocative nuclear threats with north korean dictator kim jong un  if that s not terrifying enough  trump also hinted that he s planning to attack iran because  well  they may or may not be abiding by the nuclear deal  all indications are that they are  but that doesn t stop a commander in chief who desperately  so desperately  needs a way to wag the dog on friday  trump announced that there might be a third war on the table  this one against venezuela  we have many options for venezuela  including a possible military option  if necessary   trump told reporters at his new jersey golf club on friday the president did not answer a question about whether american troops would lead a potential operation  we don t talk about it  but a military operation  a military option  is certainly something we could pursue   he responded source  cnbcto be fair  venezuela isn t exactly our friend  two years ago  president obama issued sanctions against the oil rich country  in part over its human rights abuses the white house said the order targeted people whose actions undermined democratic processes or institutions  had committed acts of violence or abuse of human rights  were involved in prohibiting or penalizing freedom of expression  or were government officials involved in public corruption  venezuelan officials past and present who violate the human rights of venezuelan citizens and engage in acts of public corruption will not be welcome here  and we now have the tools to block their assets and their use of u s  financial systems   white house spokesman josh earnest said in a statement  we are deeply concerned by the venezuelan government s efforts to escalate intimidation of its political opponents   he added source  reuterstrump  whose only political tactic is to try to intimidate his political opponents  also complained about the human rights abuses  despite having no problems with the human rights abuses of saudi arabia  russia and the philippines one fact  and only one fact  might indicate that trump is just bluster  trump s cozy relationship with russian president vladimir putin might actually be keeping us safer  at least as far as the idea of trump waging war against venezuela or north korea  venezuela is a strong trading partner of russia  putin also backs north korea  as does our largest trading partner  china this whole show could be just trump trying to boost his poll numbers  or it could be his way of pretending to create distance between him and putin  but regardless  the talk is reckless and potentially deadly  the people he s threatening don t see his talk as political posturing  they are taking it very seriously and even if trump doesn t pull the trigger first  they certainly could featured image via mark wilson getty images
