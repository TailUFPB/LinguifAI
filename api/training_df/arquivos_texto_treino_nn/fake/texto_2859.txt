trump may be working to silence government agencies like the department of the interior  home to the national park service  as well as the epa and the usda s science and research office  but some government employees are not having it  operating anonymously  a group of rangers from the national park service  with the help of some friends  are running a twitter account that s going after trump s efforts to muzzle science the name on the account is altusnatparkservice  they ve been around since   but only became well known over the last day or so as trump worked to remove scientific information from the white house website  and seems to be ordering any agency or department that publishes climate science to shut it in addition to posting photos from our beautiful national parks  these rangers have also launched a very obvious offensive effort against herr trump by being a veritable fount of climate science these are people who will not be silenced these are people who will not allow their colleagues to be silenced either and besides the climate science they re tweeting  they re also taking very pointed digs at trump  take a look below hello  we are the alternative
