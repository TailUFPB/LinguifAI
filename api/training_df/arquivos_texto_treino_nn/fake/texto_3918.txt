saturday night live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election  before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or  deplorable   the cast of saturday night live could not help but drop the act and get real with america it began as it normally does  with alec baldwin s masterful donald trump character and kate mckinnon s excellent portrayal of hillary clinton  if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine   i never use emails   trump says in the cold opener   i use a very private  very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it it s called twitter  after he is informed that everyone can see his tweets   trump  replies  really  and i m still in this thing  america you must really hate this lady  after a scathing rebuke of the media s decision to ignore trump s cozy relationship with putin  the kkk  and the fbi and instead focus on something as meaningless as hillary clinton s emails  something magical happened  mckinnon and baldwin dropped the facade and got serious  i m sorry  kate  i just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this   baldwin says  i just feel gross all the time about this  don t you all feel gross   he added  addressing the audience mckinnon agrees and the two embark on a  friendship montage  through the city before returning to the stage  then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year  none of this would have mattered if you don t vote   baldwin says  we can t tell you who to vote for  but on tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in   mckinnon finishes they re right watch it below  featured image via screengrab
