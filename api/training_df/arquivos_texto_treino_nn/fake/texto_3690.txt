sean hannity wants to destroy freedom of the press by punishing any news outlet that told the ugly truth about donald trump during his radio show on tuesday  trump s most frequent ass kisser suggested that trump bar certain networks from the white house press room because he says they  colluded  with the clinton campaign and that they should be banned until they admit it  even though these networks were merely doing their jobs by covering all the bullshit trump was saying and doing throughout his campaign  maybe donald trump should rethink how he deals with media   hannity said  why should cnn have a seat in the white house press room  why should nbc have a seat there  why should the new york times have a seat there  or politico  they all think they re journalists  they re all full of crap  and they ve all been exposed  until members of the media come clean about colluding with the clinton campaign and admit that they knowingly broke every ethical standard they are supposed to uphold  they should not have the privilege  they should not have the responsibility of covering the president on behalf of you  the american people  hannity continued his tirade on twitter on wednesday by calling prominent networks like abc  nbc  and cnn  biased  and  fake news  and repeated his call for trump to blacklist them from having access  politico  cnn  nbcnews  cnbc  msnbc  nytimes  abc  cbsnews are all biased and corrupt   fake news   if i were  realdonaldtrump no access  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  november    media outlets just for doing their jobs would be a violation of the constitution  but if hannity really wants to play this game  he would be well advised to remember that turnabout is fair play and there will likely be a democrat in the white house four years from now that could do more than just blacklist fox news in retaliation  the fcc could be easily directed to shut hannity and fox news down  and frankly  that would be a good thing  so whatever donald trump and his minions do in an effort to punish people  policies  and institutions they don t like  democrats should retaliate by burying the rght wing so hard that they ll really have something to whine about featured image  screenshot
