on sunday  rnc chair reince priebus sat down with chuck todd on meet the press  where the two discussed donald trump s refusal to release his tax returns  while they are not bound by law  presidential candidates have traditionally released their tax returns to the public  it serves as a way to gain trust with the public because tax returns have a unique way of showing what financial allegiances one has  trump has refused to take part in the tradition todd questioned priebus on the matter  asking  one final question when it comes to the issue of the clinton foundation and tax returns  i want to ask it this way  donald trump s been hitting hard on the clinton foundation and saying all sorts of behind the scenes  pay for play allegations  does he have   does it undercut his message if he won t release his tax returns  would he have some higher ground  be on higher ground here when criticizing clinton s finances if we saw his tax returns  no i don t think so   priebus responds  by the way  roger stone is the latest republican to call for donald trump to release his tax returns  a close friend of trump s   todd mentions  no i don t think so  priebus reiterates before saying   because if you look at what hillary clinton has done   i think when voters look at what hillary clinton actually did  they see somebody that they believe broke the law  they see somebody who gave away state secrets  they see somebody that went out of her way   we know that hillary clinton shouldn t be trusted with national secrets and with the most precious   the most precious information that our country has in their hands  we know she can t be trusted  are you equating that the known conclusion that she can t be trusted with state secrets to what could be in donald trump s taxes  that s when todd gets to the heart of the matter at hand  we ve had a history of every major nominee releasing their tax returns  reince  every major presidential nominee   todd says   and by the way  he is a private businessman whose companies may or may not benefit from him being president  that s something voters should want to know  for a republican running with a reactionary campaign slogan like  make america great again   trump sure does not have any respect for american traditions you can watch a clip from the interview below featured image from video screenshot
