the trump administration  along with congress members like paul ryan  really want to get some form of obamacare repeal passed  and passed quickly  the repeal only bill died when several republican senators  including lisa murkowski of alaska  voted no on a motion to advance the bill to the full senate for debate and the white house is not happy about that  they are very unhappy about it  not only did trump run over to twitter to say that she  let the republicans  and our country  down  too bad   but both of alaska s senators also received calls from secretary of the interior ryan zinke  who proceeded to threaten her entire state over her vote  in essence  he threatened to withhold all kinds of funding from her state as punishment for her vote  according to the alaska post dispatch alaska sen  dan sullivan  who voted  yes  on the motion  said the call from zinke heralded a  troubling message  i m not going to go into the details  but i fear that the strong economic growth  pro energy  pro mining  pro jobs and personnel from alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop   sullivan said efforts and issues on the line include nominations of alaskans to interior posts  an effort to build a road out of king cove through the izembek national wildlife refuge  and future opportunities to drill in the arctic national wildlife refuge and expand drilling in the national petroleum reserve alaska  among other regulatory issues that are a priority for murkowski and sullivan this is trump trying to force members of congress to bend to his will  it s a strong arm tactic that s beneath the office of the president and patently disgusting to boot  it s reminiscent of a scene in full metal jacket where gunnery sergeant hartmann begins punishing his entire platoon for one private s ongoing problems during basic training raul grijalva  a representative from arizona  has called for an investigation into zinke s threats against alaska  he s the top democrat on the house committee on natural resources and plans to ask both the government accountability office and the department of the interior s inspector general s office to investigate good murkowski  for her part  isn t cowed  she says she promised to work with the new administration on things that matter to alaskans  and she intends to continue on that path  she doesn t believe the administration will actually cut off alaska  but the fact that anyone in the administration threatened her state over her vote remains featured image via alex wong getty images
