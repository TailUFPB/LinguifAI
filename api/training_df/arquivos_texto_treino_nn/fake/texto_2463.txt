donald trump has declared war on the free press and his chief of staff apparently has his back  appearing on face the nation this sunday  reince priebus defended the tweeter in chief when it comes to his feud with the media trump has proclaimed the press to be  the enemy of the american people    through his twitter account  of course  and priebus thinks we should take this  seriously   but for all the wrong reasons  cbs host john dickerson asked priebus about trump naming the media the enemy in his tweet and the response he got was probably not what he was expecting  well  i think you should take it seriously   priebus said   i think that the problem we ve got is that we re talking about bogus stories like the one in the new york times  that we ve had constant contact with russian officials  the next day  the wall street journal had a story that the intel community was not giving the president a full intelligence briefing  both stories grossly inaccurate  overstated  overblown  and it s total garbage  the chief of staff continued  explaining that his biggest complaint about the media is their habit of protecting their sources and not outing them to the world  i think that the media should stop with this unnamed source stuff   priebus said   put names on a piece of paper and print it  if people aren t willing to put their name next to a quote  then the quote shouldn t be listed we re talking about stupidity and intelligence reporting that is based on facts that s not coming out of the actual heads of these intelligence agencies  and we re sitting here talking about it  and it s a shame  and it needs to end  trump and his team are trying their best to convince the american people that the only place they can get the truth is from them  they are doing all they can to delegitimize the media and convince us that everything the press tells us is a lie  if the people don t trust the media  then there will be no one to bust them when the start spinning their  alternative facts  and this is precisely what the trump administration wants here s the video featured image via video screen capture
