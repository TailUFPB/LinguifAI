donald trump responded to the seizure of an american underwater drone the way he responds to everything  by going off half cocked on twitter  however  it turns out that the crisis was over before he even sent out his first nasty tweet  and guess what  he wouuld have known this if he had bothered to get his daily intelligence briefing to be fair  it is possible that either trump or his aides were informed that the situation had been resolved just a few hours after it began  with the chinese agreeing to return the  underwater unmanned vehicle   but from the content of his tweets  it sure doesn t seem that way trump started off at   a m  on saturday morning with a tweet that put his ignorance on display and embarrassed the nation yet again image via winning democratsafter being smacked down by everyone on twitter with even half a brain  including the actual freaking dictionary  trump later swapped out his tweet for a version that used the word  unprecedented  rather than  unpresidented  when the news that china had agreed to return the drone broke shortly before noon on saturday  trump transition team spokesman jason miller couldn t wait to claim that trump and his little whiny tweet deserved the credit for this turn of events by saturday night  trump was in a different mood and rather than stomping his feet he decided he d rather just give china the middle finger instead via screenshotbut u s  ambassador to china max baucus found out that china would be returning the uuv four hours before trump sent out his first misspelled tweet the huffington post reports baucus  a former democratic senator from montana  lodged his first protest that day  as did u s  military representatives to their chinese counterparts  late saturday afternoon beijing time   pre dawn   a m  in washington   baucus relayed word that china had agreed to return the device  according to the state department  that handover took place tuesday  near the same location as the original incident trump will become president of the united states one month from today   cue chills up the spine   he should damn well know better  how would he know  you ask  well  that s what those boring intelligence briefings are for  you know  the one s trump says just tell you the same stuff every day  if trump had gotten his presidential daily brief  before launching into a temper tantrum on twitter  he would have known that the entire situation had already been resolved featured image via mark wilson getty images
