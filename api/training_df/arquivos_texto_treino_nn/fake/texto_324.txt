donald trump is now obsessed with attacking the nfl on friday night  trump demanded that nfl team owners fire any player who kneels during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and called nfl quarterback colin kaepernick a  son of a bitch  seriously  trump just publicly insulted a private citizen and called for dozens of firings  this is the so called president of the united states apparently  trump is tired of north korea not giving in to his demands so he picked a new target closer to home after much criticism  trump jumped on twitter to throw a temper tantrum on saturday night if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the nfl or other leagues  he or she should not be allowed to disrespect    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    our great american flag  or country  and should stand for the national anthem  if not  you re fired  find something else to do   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    goodell of nfl just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country tell them to stand   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    trump clearly went to bed angry because he woke up early on sunday morning to continue his hissy fit if nfl fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag   country  you will see change take place fast  fire or suspend   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    nfl attendance and ratings are way down  boring games yes  but many stay away because they love our country  league should back u s   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    s right  trump literally just called for a boycott of an american business because it s not racist enough and suggested that the nfl is anti american for not punishing players for exercising their constitutional rights  kneeling during the national anthem is a protest against racial injustice  and so far  it has been working  attention has been brought to the issue  but trump wants owners to start firing players who kneel or force them to stand  which would likely see a bunch of lawsuits filed against the nfl refusing to stand during the national anthem is protected as free speech and expression by the constitution  it would be like forcing kids to stand and say the pledge of allegiance in school  which is what trump will probably do next after he gets humiliated by the nfl the nfl can do that by making sure colin kaepernick gets signed by a team  and every nfl player should kneel during the anthem in solidarity with their fellow teammates  their teammates are under attack by donald trump now  it s time to kneel together  not just to protest racism  but to protest him as well  because trump is the biggest racist of them all featured image  david becker   stringer via getty
