not long before donald trump pathetically admitted that president obama was born in the united states  two of his white supporters stood outside the republican nominee s new washington d c  hotel and claimed that black people don t work as hard as white people and that was an incredibly bad idea considering they were standing in a city that would not exist without the back breaking labor of slaves who built many of the buildings around the city  including the white house so when these two trump supporters ran their mouths  carlos maza of media matters starting filming them just as a black man rode up on his bicycle and informed them of just how wrong they are  you see these buildings down here  black people built the buildings on slave labor   he said using georgetown university as an example   so a lot of black people have residual anger for their ancestors building this country as free labor  indeed  white racists would rather pretend black people had nothing to do with constructing our nation s capitol rather than acknowledge that they played a major role but the man was not finished schooling trump s supporters  as soon as a white person steps into america  they have an advantage just by being white   the man pointed out before going on to explain that systemic racism has been built into the system the trump fans tried to change the topic by claiming that thousands of europeans have been killed by muslims  which is incorrect  hundreds of europeans have been killed by terrorists  not true practitioners of islam a white people standing by the black man then asked the trump duo if they have really ever experienced discrimination and they admitted that they haven t here s the video via twitter here s a trump supporter getting schooled on systemic racism after suggesting white people work harder  pic twitter com   carlos maza   gaywonk  september    yet donald trump wonders why black people don t want to vote for him featured image via screenshot
