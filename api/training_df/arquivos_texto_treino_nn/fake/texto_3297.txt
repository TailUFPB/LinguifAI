news broke on thursday that donald trump had actually taken his president s daily briefing two days in a row  how in the hell did this end up being news  the answer is simple  because the man we have chosen to run this country is too stupid to know just how stupid he is  he s so stupid he thinks he s too smart to get intel briefings trump has come under fire for refusing to get his daily intelligence briefings  his defense is that he s a really smart guy and the pdb is like  boring and stuff  so he d just rather not  besides  that s what mike pence is for  right  i don t have to be told   you know  i m  like  a smart person  i don t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day   trump told fox news   i don t need to be told   the same thing every day  every morning   same words   sir  nothing has changed  let s go over it again   i don t need that  so now  this is where we find ourselves  when trump actually does his job for a mere two days  it s news  two freaking days   realdonaldtrump received daily intelligence briefing today  his spokesman says  making it the second day in a row he s received pdb   jeff zeleny   jeffzeleny  december    receiving president daily briefing today in florida  for the second day in a row   ben siegel   benyc  december    fact that it is news when the commander in chief gets two days of intelligence briefings back to back should terrify every person in this country  it also highlights exactly how trump has managed to send our foreign relations  particularly with china  into a nosedive before he even gets inaugurated if he had been interested in his intelligence briefings  maybe he would have known better than to chat up the president of taiwan  if he had gotten his pdb before going off half cocked on twitter to rant about china seizing our drone  he would have known that the crisis had already been resolved but for now  trump has had two days of intel briefings in a row and since that is a first for this narcissistic moron  it s news  sad featured image via drew angerer getty images
