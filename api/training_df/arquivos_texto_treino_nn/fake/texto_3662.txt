during the republican primaries  the biggest feud  if you don t include donald trump and megyn kelly  seemed to be between ted cruz and the man who is now the president elect  now  cruz is one of trump s strongest supporters  well  he seems to be one of trump s strongest supporters  except for the fact that cruz can t seem to make himself say that trump isn t a liar in may  cruz went on a rant calling trump a  pathological liar   after trump accused cruz  father of being involved in the assassination of john f  kennedy  yes  that a how insane the election of  got   trump  doesn t know the difference between truth and lies  he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth  here s that somewhat surreal exchange between cruz and the media from may just to recap  trump insults not just his rival  but his rival s family  cruz calls trump a  pathological liar   and now cruz is a trump supporter  well  they do say politics makes strange bedfellows still  it appears cruz hasn t quite let it go  on sunday s this week  cruz was asked   do you still think donald trump is a liar  cruz had no answer  other than to say   you know  i m not going to re litigate the past  i m going to focus on the future  i m going to focus on what s in front of us  here s the video while it s become the stereotype that politicians lack principles  it s apparent that for many in the republican party  principles sell for cheap  cruz has long been among trump s most vocal critics  and suddenly  none of that matters because with trump a   cruz sees an opportunity for a cabinet position  and b   cruz thinks his dream of a theocratic government will finally come true under trump  cruz might be right on both counts featured image via video screen capture
