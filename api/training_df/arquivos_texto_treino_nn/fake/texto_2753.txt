when it comes to how shameless the trump family seems to be  it seems to be limitless  they seem to only care about what effects them personally  and how powerful they can become at whatever cost comes to others along the way what donald trump jr  just  liked  on twitter is just more proof of this as several muslims in quebec  canada  perished in a mosque shooting  many mourned this loss  it was a horrific act of violence  and no one should ever have to be a part of such a thing however  having no heart and clearly no grasp of the details of the situation  trump jr  decided he would appreciate how much political capital could come out of this if the shooter was muslim the tweet trump jr   liked  reads as such  when it s revealed that the  quebecshooting terrorists are muslims   trump will have a tremendous spike in political capital   muslimban via twittertrump jr  seems to not so much care about the loss of life  but rather about the fact that his dad could score some political points this is what a sociopath looks like as it turns out  the shooter wasn t muslim  and was  in fact  an extremist white guy who is a fan of donald trump  this isn t to say that trump s anti muslim rhetoric here in the united states is what led to the shooting  but it certainly is an interesting  and very concerning  coincidence it s disgusting that one of the first thoughts out of donald trump jr  s brain was how he could use people dying to his dad s advantage  he should be ashamed of himself featured photo by david becker getty images
