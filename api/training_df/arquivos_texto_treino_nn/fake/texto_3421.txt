during the revelations that russia had a giant hand in influencing our election  one word has been used throughout the media  unprecedented  well  unprecedented is not exactly true  while it is true that russia s hacking has been blatant and trump s involvement is becoming undeniable  this isn t the first time a foreign and hostile government has played a role in installing a republican leader and we don t have to go very far back to see examples nearly  years ago  in   the most famously scandal ridden president began his term under a scandal  after his democratic opponent vice president hubert humphrey switched course from his president  lyndon b  johnson  and promised that we would pull out of the vietnam war  nixon began falling in the polls  on october   johnson  though  announced that there would be peace talks and nixon s lead disappeared  so  nixon invited vietnam to intervene nixon s team met secretly with anna chan chennault  a wealthy supporter of taiwanese president chiang kai shek  co chair of republican women for nixon and confidante of south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu  at nixon s behest  chennault informed thieu that nixon would secure a better deal for his country than either humphrey or johnson  and that the democrats were effectively prepared to sell out saigon in order to secure peace at any price  if chennault could convince thieu to stay away from the negotiating table  the talks would collapse  lbj would look foolish and the democrats   hour gambit would fail johnson and the democrats knew it was happening  the national security agency had intercepted cables between thieu and his d c  ambassador    still in contact with the nixon entourage  which continues to be the favorite despite the uncertainty provoked by the news of an imminent bombing halt   one communiqu  began   on the basis of these cables  lbj ordered the fbi to tap chennault s phone  the bureau  in turn  concluded that she  contacted vietnamese ambassador bui diem and advised him that she had received a message from her boss  not further identified  which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador  she said the message was that the ambassador is to  hold on  we are gonna win  and that her boss also said   hold on  he understands all of it  johnson didn t mince words  he called it  treason   and a gross violation of the logan act  which prohibits civilians from negotiating with foreign governments  still  there wasn t enough to firmly plant the smoking gun in nixon s hands  so the american people didn t have this bit of information before the election south vietnam pulled out of the peace talks and well  we got a president nixon  the rest is history  and well  people should be reminded that an administration that begins in scandal will likely end in scandal the second recent instance happened fewer than  years ago  in   university students in tehran  iran stormed the american embassy there and took  american hostages  in hindsight  we were kind of asking for it  in   the cia helped overthrow iran s government because of oil  instead  we installed the shah  who was corrupt and brutal  when the shah fell in   then president jimmy carter allowed the shah to seek medical treatment for cancer in the united states  iran s new leader  ayatollah sayyid ruhulla musawi khomeini  who hated us anyway  demanded extradition so the shah could face trial  carter refused still  as we were nearing the election  it appeared that the hostage situation was coming to a resolution  which would have nearly assured carter of reelection  the reagan camp couldn t let that happen  reagan s campaign manager  william casey talked to sources close to the ayatollah and convinced them to delay the release of the hostages  reagan went on to win the election and the hostages were released on inauguration day of course  details of both these cases are different from the details in the trump russia hacking scandal  but i would argue that today we are in a worse situation  by helping trump  russia is providing themselves blackmail ammo in case trump does something they might not find agreeable  more than that  though  in the days when cyber security is at the top of everyone s minds  what russia has done to us is as dangerous as any terrorist act and the ramifications are far bigger  trump has allowed a hostile foreign government to infiltrate our electronic communication  which is almost everything  what s next  credit card information and irs records of individuals who speak out against trump the bottom line is that we can t allow donald trump to take office  there s too much at stake  we can t afford another nixon  we can t even afford another reagan featured image via sean gallup getty images
