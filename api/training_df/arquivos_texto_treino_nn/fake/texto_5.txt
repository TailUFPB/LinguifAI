the number of cases of cops brutalizing and killing people of color seems to see no end  now  we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide  an alabama woman by the name of angela williams shared a graphic photo of her son  lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face  on facebook  it needs to be shared far and wide  because this is unacceptable it is unclear why williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest  but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not  cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody  in the post you are about to see  ms  williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son  but i think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating  hell  it could even be described as attempted murder  something tells me that this young man will never be the same  without further ado  here is what troy  alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of angela williams  son no matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be  this is completely unacceptable  the cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long  long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself  only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste this  folks  is why we say black lives matter  no way in hell would this have happened if angela williams  son had been white  please share far and wide  and stay tuned to addicting info for further updates featured image via david mcnew stringer getty images
