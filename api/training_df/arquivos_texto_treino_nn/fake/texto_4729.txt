cnn s alisyn camerota did something on wednesday that s almost unheard of from cnn  she called out donald trump on his many  many scandals and in particular  the pay and play scandal involving trump s bribing of florida s republican attorney general pam bondi  who  after receiving a donation from trump  dropped an investigation into trump university this isn t an allegation  trump paid the donation  and he paid an irs fine of    for breaking the law  still  the media generally only talks about the clinton foundation or clinton emails  both of which have amounted to absolutely nothing trump s entire narrative  when it comes to hillary clinton  is to paint her as  crooked hillary   a moniker that  despite sounding like it comes from a third grade bully who s been held back a few times  is sticking  that nickname is pure projection  though  it s trump who s crooked and camerota pointed it out  congressman   camerota said   don t you think the american public cares about breaking the law  well  these are technicalities in many cases    rep  chris collins r ny  collins said   as he pointed out on the recent bondi one  he was solicited for a donation  he told his clerk to do it  she wrote it out of the wrong checking account  source  raw storythen  back to  crooked hillary   collins tried to make the claim that she did it too  which is completely untrue  since while some donors to the clinton foundation did ask for meetings  most were told to go through regular channels  with trump and bondi  however  it was clear quid pro quo  he gave her money and she dropped the case against him  for that  both parties should be in jail camerota pressed on  let s look back   she said  pointing out that in   trump was caught exceeding legal campaign donation limits by funneling funds through  subsidiary companies  which is technically legal  but is essentially a corporate version of the crime that sent right wing provocateur dinesh d souza to federal prison cameron went on to describe actual illegalities that trump has been fined for  isn t this the very definition of payola   camerota asked   payola is the practice of bribing someone to use their influence to promote your particular interest  how does this differ  collins kept on with his both sides do it argument until camerota astutely mentioned the one key difference  what trump did was illegal  what clinton did wasn t  who s the  crooked  candidate again here s the interview gop rep  chris collins says clinton  has always been someone with her hand out  for donors https   t co  pic twitter com yuxtgfpbcm  cnn politics   cnnpolitics  september    only we could get the rest of the media  or for what that s worth  the rest of cnn  to do their jobs  if you notice  even the tweet from cnn tried to make clinton the criminal subject of the interview  not trump  in other words  don t hold your breath for a better cnn  but camerota was a breath of fresh air featured image via video screen capture
