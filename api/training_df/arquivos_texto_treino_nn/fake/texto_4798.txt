on thursday  the new york times published an article entitled  emails raise new questions about clinton foundation ties to state department   then  we read the article  let s just say that not only is there no there there  the article literally proves the exact opposite of what they are trying to say the lede paragraph of the article says this a top aide to hillary clinton at the state department agreed to try to obtain a special diplomatic passport for an adviser to former president bill clinton in   according to emails released thursday  raising new questions about whether people tied to the clinton foundation received special access at the department that sounds pretty  well   damning  is perhaps too strong a word  but the very next paragraph admits that the adviser  douglas j  band  didn t get the passport  think about it  not even an adviser to the secretary of state s very own husband  who happens to be a former president  got what he wanted out of the state department  that s the very opposite of evidence of quid pro quo  vox has more detail if this proves anything at all  it s that the media is certainly not in the tank for clinton  actually  it was harvard who proved that back in july a new report released this week by harvard kennedy school s shorenstein center on media  politics  and public policy found clinton has received far more negative coverage than any other candidate in the race thus far  the study was based on an analysis of news statements from cbs  fox  the los angeles times  nbc  the new york times  usa today  the wall street journal  and the washington post according to the study  a whopping  percent of clinton coverage is negative  at that time  just  percent of trump coverage was negative  the new york times article might not be absolute proof that the media is stacked against clinton  but when people think of the mainstream media  they certainly are at the top of most people s lists  the new york times supposedly sets the standard  and apparently the standard in this election cycle is to manufacture controversies that  with the teeniest bit of analysis  actually disprove the controversies  yes  that s convoluted and confusing  but that s the only way propaganda like this works featured image via justin sullivan getty images
