donald trump already has blood on his hands  over the weekend  trump ordered his first raid and somehow managed to completely f  k up what was supposed to be a very straightforward operation  thanks to his carelessness and trigger happy nature  trump got a navy seal killed the raid was on al qaeda in yemen  and trump decided to go through with the raid even though he did not have sufficient intelligence  ground support or adequate backup preparations   because of trump s literal lack of intelligence  u s  navy seal william  ryan  owens was killed  as well as many other non combatant civilian deaths  according to reuters  about  people  including  women and children  were killed   and of course  trump managed to screw things up so badly that no militants or prisoners were taken in during this process as more details came in about this mess of an operation  it was discovered that trump decided to go ahead with the raid without even doing the most minimal preparations  it was reported  u s  military officials told reuters that trump approved his first covert counterterrorism operation without sufficient intelligence  ground support or adequate backup preparations  as a result  three officials said  the attacking seal team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al qaeda base defended by landmines  snipers  and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed islamist extremists  and as expected  guess who trump and his team are blaming for this  former president barack obama  according to a white house official  the obama administration had signed off on the raid last month  but delayed it for  operational reasons   an official said  the decision was made   to leave it to the incoming administration  partly in the hope that more and better intelligence could be collected  but of course  trump and his team didn t bother to collect more information before proceeding  especially since trump truly believes that he is  like  a smart person   unfortunately  he s not smart enough to know he should gather current information before pressing green on a raid trump now has the blood of a u s  navy seal on his hands  but don t expect him to take accountability for it  this could have been avoided and should have ever happened  unfortunately  it will probably happen again because trump and his team are too incompetent to learn from their mistakes featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
