apparently  if you are unqualified enough for a job  you will develop mind control powers   at least  that s what neo nazi matthew heimbach thinks   during his campaign  donald trump regularly encouraged his supporters to beat up african americans in the crowd  even offering to pay their legal fees if they did as he told them to  a promise that  like most of his promises  has yet to manifest  in march heimbach  leader of the white nationalist traditionalist youth network and a loyal donald trump soldier took it to heart when the donald screamed  get  em out of here  as african american protesters attempted to inform him and his supporters that their lives have just as much value as white lives  and infinitely more value than those of the crackers who would vote for the ideological reincarnation of adolf hitler  though protesters generally leave that detail out   heimbach  wearing his magamagamaga hat  can be seen in a video captured at the time shoving and punching an african american woman as trump sicced his posse on her kashiya nwanguma  the woman from the video and other protesters who were attacked recently filed suit against heimbach  two other trump supporters  and the trump campaign   and heimbach  who is representing himself  responded with a countersuit not against the women but against the man for whom he voted heimbach claims he acted  pursuant to the directives and requests of donald j  trump and donald j  trump for president  and that if he s found liable for damages    any liability must be shifted to one or both of them  in other words  he knows he s fucked and hoping the  i was just following orders  defense works out for him even if he does have to throw trump under the bus  heimbach says he denies physically assaulting  protesters  adding that they  provoked a response  by attempting to  disrupt a free assembly and campaign event and to infringe rights of the defendants and other attendees to freedom of speech  freedom of assembly  freedom to vote and other constitutional rights  one again  he can be seen on video attacking nwanguma  since he will almost assuredly be using google a lot in preparing his defense  he should probably look up  perjury  while he is at it  mr  nazi adds that he acted  if at all  in self defense  as well as  in reasonable defense of others    even when he was shoving his victim from behind heimbach says that the donald is a  world famous businessman  who relies on various professionals including attorneys and other professional advisors   so he relied on trump s reputation and expertise in doing the things alleged   this accidental admission of fault will  of course  come back to bite him in his posterior this filing comes alongside one filed by one of the other attackers  alvin bamberger  who also attacked nwanguma  bamberger says that he   had no prior intention to act as he did  and  would not have acted as he did without trump and or the trump campaign s specific urging and inspiration   he  admits only that he touched a woman  and  like mr  nazi  denies that he assaulted that woman    video be damned speaking of video  you can watch it below featured image via screengrab
