back in february  donald trump described his administration as  running like a fine tuned machine  and that mind numbingly stupid remark will come back to haunt him as much as his  we re going to win so much  you re going to get tired of winning  promise to his supporters  case in point  the alleged president held a signing today but had nothing to sign on monday  trump announced his goal to privatize the nation s air traffic control system  but that proposal was actually based on legislation introduced by rep  bill shuster  r pa   the chairman of the house transportation and infrastructure committee  that bill never came to fruition on the house floor for a vote as it faced bipartisan opposition in the senate but anyway  trump sat down at a desk and signed two documents time reports there was only one problem  he wasn t actually signing something that would have any tangible impact on what he had just proposed a white house aide told reporters trump had signed  a decision memo and letter transmitting legislative principles to congress   surrounding the privatization of the air traffic control system  which he had just spent the last few minutes advocating for  but in order for his goal to come to fruition  congress would need to pass legislation implementing it  before trump gave remarks monday  white house officials had told reporters that the president is only dictating his legislative goals of separating air traffic controls from the faa  congress is not required to follow through on these goals still yet  while trump fake signed a bill which doesn t exist  yet  if ever   his team was behind him applauding the signing this isn t the first time trump did something like this but previously it was even worse  during a press conference  he said in mid january   these papers are just some of the many documents i ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons  they are not going to discuss  with me  again  i don t have to do this  they re not going to discuss it with me  the pages appear to be blank the pages are blank  pic twitter com aglqnbtjrg  mikey neumann   mikeyface  january    s signing event was as fake as his presidency photo by andrew harrer pool getty images
