when you are black in america  getting pulled over by a cop   even for the smallest infraction   is a very scary thing  as we have seen repeatedly  this could cost you your life  usually  when that happens  the cop in question faces no real consequences  generally  the police department investigates itself and finds it did nothing wrong  naturally  so  to that end  black americans tend to act with extreme compliance when it comes to interactions with police  not being that way could cost us our lives  however  one brave black driver who was pulled over for not using his turn signal properly decided that he s had enough  and confronted the cop who pulled him over and approached with a drawn gun the whole incident was caught on video  as the man goes all in on the cop  saying  big f cking crime right  big crime  a crime enough for you to come with your fucking gun pulled out  right  a turn signal not made is a big enough crime for you to need to take out your service pistol  do you have no conscience  you just don t give a f ck right  because i would have been just another dead black motherf cker right   the man tells the officer   and you would have just gone about your business  right  luckily  the officer didn t shoot  and just accepted this rightfully outraged driver reading him the goods on his racist behavior  it s too bad more encounters with racist cops making unfounded assumptions about the supposed dangerous criminality of black americans can t end this way now  time to find out who this cop is watch the priceless video evidence of america s racist policing problem below cop pulls over a black man for failure to signal  walks to his car with his gun drawn  black dude is my fucking hero                      pic twitter com      chocooptimus  september    ending of black dude going ham on cop  left him looking stupid as fuck    pic twitter com      chocooptimus  september    image via video screen capture
