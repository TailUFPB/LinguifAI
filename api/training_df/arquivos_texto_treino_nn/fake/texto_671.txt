no one takes donald trump seriously anymore  not the majority of americans who voted against him  not a good portion of regretful trump voters  and not even the members of the party that helped get him elected so he could push their agenda forward  that s right   trump has become a joke to many members of the republican party now  and he knows it  in fact  he s throwing a tantrum trying to get their attention  but no matter what he does now  it s not working  he s lost them for good trump has recently resorted to making threats to republican lawmakers to try and show them who is boss  but they aren t afraid of him anymore  now that special counsel robert mueller s investigation into russia is closing in on trump  the gop is actually ignoring him more than they are listening  according to a report by vanity fair on thursday  mueller decided to impanel a grand jury for trump s russia investigation  signaling to many republicans that they needed to act quickly to prevent trump from sabotaging the effort  sen  thom tillis  r nc  told the washington post  the mueller situation really gave rise to our thinking about how we can address this  address the current situation  with mueller targeting trump and now that healthcare is off the table after many failures  even though trump is still demanding that gopers work on legislation   republicans are moving on  vanity fair reported  republicans used to be afraid of trump  now  they re mostly ignoring him  the administration s ham handed attempts to coerce senators dean heller and lisa murkowski to vote  yes  on obamacare repeal were met with sharp criticism from republican lawmakers  and trump s threats in the aftermath of the failed health care vote last week fell on deaf ears  sen  bob corker  r tn  was also cited for his comments about trump s bullying to republican lawmakers over the healthcare debacle  corker said  if that s what he wants to do  he ought to just do it   probably he s learned over the last couple of weeks  threats don t really go over particularly well  my advice would be to either do it or don t do it  the gop is finally growing a spine and abandoning trump  who will inevitably sink his own ship  all of these threats are falling on deaf ears now featured image via jeff j mitchell  getty images
