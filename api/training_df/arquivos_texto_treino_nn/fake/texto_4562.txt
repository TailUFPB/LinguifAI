the hosts of fox   friends were hoping a minnesota police chief would vilify the somali immigrants in his community and they promptly got their asses handed to them on saturday   year old dahir a  adan went on a stabbing spree inside a minnesota mall  the somali community in st  cloud has roundly condemned the act of terrorism  but republican nominee donald trump spewed fear and hate in response during a phone call with fox and called the immigrants a  trojan horse  and a  cancer from within  that benefits isis fox host steve doocy  who was named in gretchen carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against the conservative network  asked st  cloud police chief william blair anderson if he agrees with trump s assessment of immigrants  clearly hoping that anderson would join in demonizing them instead  anderson swatted doocy down like the pest he is and made it clear that there are bad apples in every group and that we should unite rather than divide and hate  my job is public safety  it s not in immigration policy  i can tell you that the vast majority of all of our citizens  no matter their ethnicity  are fine  hard working people  and now is not the time for us to be divisive  we already have a very cohesive community  and i expect that this will draw us even closer together  but at the end of the day  our job is public safety  period  anderson then explained that law enforcement works well with all members of the community to protect the public the best they can  we actually work very well not just with our east african community  but all of our community  we meet regularly with any number of people  whether they are advocates for a specific ethnicity or different cause  it s one of things that makes st  cloud a wonderful place to live  and i know that might sound corny  but it s the truth  we have established and maintained a very good rapport with our east african community and our community at large  doocy then tucked his tail between his legs and ended the interview because he didn t get the response he wanted here s the video via media matters demonizing an entire community simply because of the actions of a few only ostracizes them and could cause more to radicalize  that s why we should reach out to these immigrants instead of hating them fox news is irresponsibly pushing an  us versus them  mentality that only creates a never ending circle of hate and mistrust that hurts our country in the long term  but let s also remember that isis would not exist to recruit people in america in the first place had republicans not pursued an unnecessary war in iraq that created the power vacuum that allowed isis to rise  furthermore  despite their concerns and their whining  republicans still refuse to declare war on isis to give president obama the full resources of the united states to fight the terrorist organization regardless  any group will have bad apples  even the white  christians  fox news caters to  let s not forget that timothy mcveigh committed the oklahoma city bombing in  that killed  people while dylan roof gunned down nine black people inside a church in   both acts of domestic terrorism were committed by white males who were born here in the united states  but fox news would rather freak out about a somali immigrant who used a knife in an attack in which no one was killed  if adan were white  not only would this not be referred to as an act of terror  it would have been a mere footnote in the news featured image  screenshot
