sarah palin agrees with donald trump that democrats will somehow cheat to help hillary clinton win on election day  and her final solution is to kill them in a post debate rant on facebook  america s village idiot wrote that trump is  wise  for refusing to say whether he will accept the election results on november  if hillary clinton wins during the debate  the republican nominee said everyone will just have to wait and see because he wants to keep america in  suspense  his answer was outrageous and unpatriotic because if trump chooses to reject the results on election day and claim that the contest was rigged  he would not only be causing a constitutional crisis  his supporters have already threatened to attempt a bloody violent coup and an effort to assassinate clinton but sarah palin is okay with this  seems silly media sheep are all chomping down on one issue after this debate  at least according to all the reporters who hollered out this same question to me   what about trump not accepting the election results   palin wrote more power to trump for explaining how vitally important the legitimacy of every election is to our democracy within our republic what reasonable person would preemptively accept any and all hypothetical questions and conditions of any hypothetical election  trump s answer was right every american s sacred vote must be respected and legitimized in today s elections   but they must be fair elections  we re in the midst of proof of voter fraud and questionable   even violent   participatory elements in campaigns  that s why state legislators are now cracking down on voter fraud via tighter laws ensuring the security of our elections when trump is pressed on this  it harkens back to all the gop primary candidates who screamed at trump to support the republican nominee   no matter what   and trump initially responded that he could  depending on fair treatment  that is wise and insightful  trump got screwed in that deal when he eventually pledged to support the nominee and then some of his fellow candidates turned tail and refused to reciprocate when trump won trump learned   why give opponents permission and incentive to act unfairly and cheat  it s shortsighted to commit to accepting the outcome of a race regardless of unscrupulous cheaters  how totally unfair that would be to the american voter except that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in this country despite what palin and trump claim  in fact  a comprehensive study found that out of one billion votes cast between  and  only  cases of fraud were found and then palin echoed trump supporters with the following threat  trump gave potential cheaters fair warning that we ll not give them any quarter   she wrote   we ll hold them accountable  they d better be on their toes  cheaters will not win  here s her full rant via facebook trump has basically accused minority and democratic voters of being cheaters  which means sarah palin just called for executing anyone that trump s poll watching thugs accuse of cheating on election day  and that includes hillary clinton and members of the media you might point out that palin didn t use the words  execute  or  kill   however  she specifically said that  we ll not give them any quarter  no quarter is a term that is defined as follows in war  a victor gives no quarter  or takes no prisoners  when the victor shows no clemency or mercy and refuses to spare the life of a vanquished opponent in return for their surrender at discretion  unconditional surrender  so  yes  sarah palin is among the trump supporters who are threatening violent rebellion if the election does not go trump s way featured image  screenshot
