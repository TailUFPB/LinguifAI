it wasn t too long ago that donald trump deeply offended china by taking a phone call from taiwan  violating the one china policy  since then  foreign relations under this new failing presidency have been nothing but chaotic and tense   and unfortunately trump is just making things worse over the weekend  trump showed everyone that he s learning absolutely nothing about diplomacy  as he sent another  f ck you  to china  in an interview with the financial times published sunday  trump warned china that if they don t get north korea under control  america would step in  trump said he is  totally  confident that the u s  could handle north korea s nuclear weapons program without any help  his words were  if china is not going to solve north korea  we will  that is all i am telling you  china has great influence over north korea  and china will either decide to help us with north korea  or they won t  and if they do that will be very good for china  and if they don t it won t be good for anyone  then  he claimed that he could motivate china to move against the north koreans  yet failed to clarify  i m not going to tell you  you know  i am not the united states of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the middle east  this interview also had several other insane elements to it  in which trump continued to defend his lies about former president barack obama wiretapping him and insisted that those false claims were  turning out to be true   however  his comments about china are likely some of the most disturbing to come out of the interview trump s timing couldn t be more disastrous  as he is set to meet with chinese president xi jinping at his mar a lago club this week   which will likely be another opportunity for trump to disrespect china and put america at risk featured image via joe raedle   getty images
