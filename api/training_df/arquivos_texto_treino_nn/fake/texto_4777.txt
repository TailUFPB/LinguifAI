trump supporter scottie nell hughes has made some moronic comments in the past  and it s epic every time she gets called out on it  just days after she got slammed for her comments on gun violence  hughes got fact checked again on cnn by news anchor poppy harlow and activist bakari sellers commenting on trump s horrendous standing amongst minorities  harlow noted that trump is doing worse in this area than even third party candidates  hughes tried to defend the republican nominee  stating that trump holds rallies  all over the country  and that the  doors are open  to everyone  in actuality  trump usually holds his rallies in mostly white areas  and has kicked out his own supporters for having dark skin in the past making a reference to trump s recent pathetic attempt to appeal to the african american community  sellers told hughes that trump wouldn t be getting a  participation trophy  just because he happened to visit one black neighborhood during his whole campaign  sellers said  i know that many surrogates and many supporters of donald trump like to take the man away from his baggage  but you cannot sit here and not remember that donald trump is the one who supported the  birther  movement   and just yesterday in philadelphia he refused to even apologize for it  to drive his point home  sellers brought up the fact that trump hadn t wanted to have black tenants in new york city  along with trump s infamous full page ad that called for the death penalty for the central park five decades ago  hughes countered this by saying that trump s racist housing woes were probably    years ago  and  obviously mr  trump addressed it   then  she accused the press of trying to  trap him in different aspects  hughes continued on to say that even though former kkk leader david duke had endorsed trump  clinton s endorsement by  california grand dragon kkk leader today  was worse  she said  hillary clinton has yet to disavow him  so there s ties on both sides  harlow tried to grasp just what hughes was trying to say  and she asked her to clarify  hughes responded  i m saying that hillary clinton has actually stronger ties  that has not disavowed a kkk endorsement  sellers jumped in and defended the former secretary of state  scottie and any other surrogate and donald trump himself are going to have an extremely hard time with this argument  i think they re actually going down the wrong path that somehow hillary clinton is the bigot in this situation  or has some racist past or racist history  because that s simply not the case  then  hughes made the mistake of trying to accuse clinton of being involved in the birther movement during the  campaign  unable to stand this insanity any longer  harlow jumped in and shut the whole thing down  she said  scottie  that is not factual  that is not factually correct  hillary clinton never questioned the birthplace of barack obama when she was running against him  trump  on the other hand  has   several times and continues to do so today  you can watch this brilliant moment below featured image via screen capture
