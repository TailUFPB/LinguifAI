now that he s president elect  donald trump has begun turning his attention to his transition  as well as beginning to build up his cabinet  it s early right now  but sources have told politico who is in line for some top positions  if you weren t already panicking just from his win last night  now would be a good time to start perhaps most alarming are his potential picks for secretary of dhs  politico reports that sheriff david clarke is said to be a major contender  this is the milwaukee sheriff who made a name for himself calling for  pitchforks and torches  and armed rebellion if trump lost but he seems to be the main contender  not the sole contender  there s also a possibility that bridgegate kingpin chris christie could be in line for the position  as could rudy giuliani  putting either of these people in charge of agencies like u s  customs and border protection  the fbi  immigration and customs enforcement  and more  could potentially be very damaging for secretary of state  we have john bolton  former u n  ambassador and senior fellow at the american enterprise institute  bolton was a controversial figure at the u n   and he championed george w  bush s insistence on one sided foreign policy  fan bloody tastic newt gingrich could also be in line for this position  as could senator bob corker of tennessee trump is rumored to want to put his own finance chief  who s a former goldman sachs exec  in as secretary of the treasury  besides the blatant cronyism  a wall street executive in a cabinet position goes against everything trump claimed about hillary and her ties to the banks rudy giuliani is rumored to be considered for a host of positions  including attorney general  white house chief of staff  secretary of homeland security  and director of national intelligence cia director  giuliani is about as erratic and unreasonable as trump   the most benign position in this list is probably chief of staff chris christie may also be up for attorney general trump s top pick for secretary of energy is continental resources ceo harold hamm  this guy has shaped a lot of trump s ideas on energy policy  which includes gutting renewable energy and escalating fossil fuel use for secretary of the interior  the leading candidate right now is forrest lucas  the founder of lucas oil  an oil executive and a vocal animal rights opponent is such a great pick to protect our lands and our wildlife  we can probably say goodbye to national parks  the endangered species list  and more if he s chosen other candidates include none other than queen drunken airhead herself  sarah palin  as well as trump s own son  donald trump jr  no nepotism there at all trump wants a business leader  a k a  a ceo  for labor secretary  interestingly enough  though  the current commissioner of the eeoc  victoria lipnic  is said to be a frontrunner for this job  she s one of obama s picks and supports things like the equal pay act  she wants to get rid of the eeoc s pay data collection system  though trump said early on that he wanted to eliminate the epa  but has since modified that position  however  he wants to put noted climate skeptic myron ebell in charge of the agency responsible for ensuring we have clean air and clean water  so he might as well eliminate it ben carson   nuff said politico has their full list  and cnn also has a list  it s very early yet  and it s true that not every single person trump is considering would be a bad choice  for instance  he wants someone who s already got a lot of experience with veterans  affairs to head up the va  however  many of his potential picks are rampant with cronyism and just plain sheer idiocy and cluelessness featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
