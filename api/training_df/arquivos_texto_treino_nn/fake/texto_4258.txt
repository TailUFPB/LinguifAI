donald trump s presidential campaign is collapsing  thanks to his poor performance in the presidential debates  a campaign message with limited appeal  and the misogynistic assault comments he made about tv host nancy o dell that were released last friday now it seems that groups aligned with hillary clinton plan to take advantage of trump s problems  along with the huge exodus of republicans who rescinded their support for him over the weekend until now  priorities usa has spent the  election cycle entirely focused on the top of the ticket   getting clinton elected  the fact that they may use their resources to also promote democratic candidates in down ballot races suggests how increasingly confident they are in a clinton victory according to a source familiar with the plans  priorities usa is currently producing television ads to potentially air in senate contests in north carolina  nevada  new hampshire and pennsylvania   all competitive races that are also battleground states for the presidential race hillary clinton is relying on democratic members of congress to help her enact an agenda and defend president obama s gains  should she be elected to the office  a so called  wave  election would go a long way to ensuring that situation be put in place the last time conditions were similar was in  when president obama was first elected to the white house  two years before  democrats won a ton of seats in the house and senate which gave them majorities in both bodies  as a result  democrats were able to get the economic stimulus passed  along with the affordable care act  both without the help of republicans  who had decided to completely block the obama agenda  no matter what  since then republicans have put in place more so called  gerrymandered  seats  which are congressional seats whose districts are designed to consistently favor one party over another  republicans have done this in so many states  it is wildly believed that they have insulated themselves from being dislodged  but not everyone agrees that this majority status lives on forever featured image via flickr
