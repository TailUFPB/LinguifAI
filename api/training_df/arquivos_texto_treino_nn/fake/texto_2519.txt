donald trump has been nothing but a disaster since taking office nearly four weeks ago and now even republicans want him impeached of particular concern is trump s ties with russia and his assaults on the free press and the judicial branch trump seems to fancy himself a king and republicans in congress are gleefully treating him that way instead of doing their public duty to protect this country from threats like him well  a former republican judge is disgusted with his party and he just publicly called for trump s impeachment mark painter served on the ohio court of appeals for many years and the republican party is unrecognizable to him today  it used to be a center right party but trump has solidified it as the party of extremists who deny reality and facts with impunity and that s why painter is offering to help republicans draft articles of impeachment to take trump down before it s too late  in any time except our post factual era  no office holder  much less the president  could get away with any one of the dozens of dazzlingly illegal things trump has already done   painter wrote in a piece for cinncinati com   they would forfeit office immediately  each new day is a new nightmare  we are still trying to digest one breathtaking assault on america when another is signed  issued  or tweeted  all this amid constant lies  constant  lies  it s tough  but we must end this dangerous presidency  trump must be impeached and removed with all haste  but only congress can initiate the process  painter calls out ohio rep  steve chabot specifically and tells him to  man up  and stop defending trump  pointing out that chabot helped draft articles of impeachment for bill clinton for far less than what trump has done indeed  bill clinton had an extramarital affair in office and lied about it under oath  donald trump has lied about anything and everything  including his ties to russia  his taxes  his conflicts of interest  etc he has violated the constitution in so many ways it is hard to count them all  but painter mentions a few  basic american values   free speech  the rule of law  separation of powers  even common decency   are unknown in this white house  we now have a president who has no concept of separation of powers  or why we have three branches of government  if he knew anything about the constitution  he would know the framers envisioned just the situation we have now   a would be dictator  they provided checks and balances   such as an independent judiciary to protect us from presidential tyranny we must admit we have elected a president who has immediately proved himself to be a grifter  a pathological liar  a mean spirited bully and dangerous to american values  this not ready for prime time show is too dangerous to continue  america is at stake  it s time to end trump s regime before he destroys our country  the only problem is that republicans are eager to help him destroy it  in the end  elections  protests  and impeachment could be useless methods to get rid of trump  as long as republicans control congress they will refuse to save the country and they will remain in control by trying to destroy voting rights  they are also already proposing bills designed to quell protests  and when peaceful methods of changing our government are taken away from the people  that only leaves the kind of method that thomas jefferson spoke of in a letter to william stephens smith in  hopefully  it won t come down to that  but we can t keep pretending that peaceful protests will make republicans listen to reason  nor can we expect republicans to stop chipping away at voting rights  and the fact that republicans are okay with russia helping their candidate win suggests they will expect foreign help in  and   we also can t expect the judicial branch to stop trump because republicans are already busy working on a bill to split up the ninth circuit court as punishment for not agreeing with trump s executive order the american people need to rise up and demand the impeachment of trump and his entire administration  and then a new election must be held  the future of our nation depends on it featured image via andrew harrer   pool getty images
