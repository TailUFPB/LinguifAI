donald trump is a bumbling fool  a racist bumbling fool who s more afraid of alienating his racist base than anything  so when a national tragedy like charlottesville occurs  his responses are insensitive at best  clumsy beyond belief  un presidential  and oftentimes  just flat out disgusting and wrong  when we most need a real president  we don t have one at least  not one that sits in the white house right now but president obama  despite having served his two terms and now living a civilian life  still manages to have the exact right thing to say  sure  he no longer gets in front of the cameras and country and says it  but he does say it to his massive social media audiences  and he s oftentimes more popular than trump  like with his response to charlottesville  twitter told the bbc that the following tweet  from one president barack obama  is now the most liked tweet in history  no one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion  pic twitter com   barack obama   barackobama  august    s quoting nelson mandela  and these words ring truer now than ever given the resurgence of white supremacy in the u s  and the picture  that s from a  visit to a daycare center in bethesda  maryland obama s got nearly  million likes and over  million retweets   far more than anything the tissue paper skinned trump has ever gotten  for someone who touts himself as the best there ever was at everything everywhere in the whole entire universe  this has to hurt  trump s ego can t handle someone like obama who he needs to be weak to be this strong  this popular  and this well liked obama has class  obama has wits  obama has intelligence  and he s still got the ear of much of the country  the above tweet is the first in a series of three  and here are the other two  people must learn to hate  and if they can learn to hate  they can be taught to love  barack obama   barackobama  august    for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite     nelson mandela  barack obama   barackobama  august    image via chip somodevilla and mark wilson getty images
