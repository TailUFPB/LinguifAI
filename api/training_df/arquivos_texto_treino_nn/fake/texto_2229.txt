donald trump s obsession with building a massive expensive wall along the mexican border is literally going to make america less secure despite claiming that he will beat back terrorism and keep americans safe  trump is drafting a budget proposal that would cripple three of the nation s most critical agencies that do way more to help americans than any wall will ever do the cost of trump s wall is projected to reach past   billion  during the campaign  trump repeatedly claimed that mexico would pay for the wall  but it s clear now that american taxpayers will be footing the bill  and rather than create a new budget item  trump is considering just cutting funding from existing national security and national emergency management agencies to use it to pay for the wall instead on the chopping block includes the u s  coast guard  a crucial branch of the military that patrols and secures our ports  coast lines  and waterways  defending them from potential terrorist attacks and rescuing people this particular cut is fiercely opposed by republican rep  duncan hunter  who explained on cnn wednesday why the coast guard is too important to slash  you have president trump talking about security  criminal networks   that s what the coast guard does  literally   hunter said   so how can the president talk about  stopping illegal immigration  illegal drugs  and criminal narco networks  and then say we re going to cut the military and cut the coast guard  the way you stop bad things from happening here is not directly on the border  necessarily  so this is nonsensical to me  but that s not all according to the washington post the proposal  drawn up by the office of management and budget  omb   also would slash the budget of the federal emergency management agency  which provides disaster relief after hurricanes  tornadoes and other natural disasters  the coast guard s    billion budget in  would be cut  percent to about    billion  while the tsa and fema budgets would be reduced about  percent each to    billion and    billion  respectively in regards to the transportation security administration  trump plans to cut post   programs  which includes a program that trains airline crews how to deal with hijackers  a program that funds the use of special law enforcement teams that sweep transportation hubs for potential threats prior to and during major events like an inauguration  a program that gives local law enforcement more ability to patrol in and around airports  and a program that funds the use of special tsa agents who are trained to specifically detect people exhibiting odd behavior at check points in other words  programs that  have been considered a vital piece of airport security and for preventing a repetition of the sept      hijackings so trump is literally looking to sacrifice programs designed to prevent another   in order to build a wall that most experts consider useless in stopping immigration donald trump is once again demonstrating that he cares more about himself than he does about the safety and security of the american people  the coast guard protects our coastal boarders from inside and outside threats  the tsa helps prevent another   attack from occurring on american soil  and fema responds to help americans before  during  and after a disaster strikes  gutting these agencies doesn t make america safer  it makes us more vulnerable and that appears to be exactly what trumps wants if it wasn t clear enough before  it definitely is now  trump is the greatest threat to our national security featured image via mark wallheiser getty images
