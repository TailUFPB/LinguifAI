jake tapper laid into kellyanne conway on tuesday over donald trump s claim that the media is covering up terrorist attacks on monday  trump literally accused the media of ignoring terrorist attacks to keep the american people in the dark and to keep them in opposition to his muslim ban  it s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported   trump told u s  central command   and in many cases  the very  very dishonest press doesn t want to report it  they have their reasons and you understand that  except that the media has covered lots of terrorist attacks over the years  most of them extensively and journalists have risked their lives to report on some of them trump released a list of supposed undercovered terrorist attacks and the list somehow included paris  nice  and san bernardino among other significant attacks even though the media exhaustively covered them so cnn let conway appear again on the network to answer for trump s lies  and they apparently did that so she could get her ass handed to her by jake tapper during the interview  tapper demanded to know why trump won t stop lying and refused to take conway s bullshit when she attempted to spin  after he said that  the white house released a list of the attacks that he was supposedly referring to as  in his words  not even being reported  i want to put some footage of cnn reporters covering attacks that were on that list   tapper said   saying that we don t cover terrorism  that s just false  and  indeed  he did put the footage up and forced conway to concede that not only did cnn cover many of the attacks on the list  they did a good job doing it but conway still tried to claim that trump was somehow making a point by including those attacks and she soon began whining about how the media has covered trump from the campaign trail to the white house apparently  the wicked witch of the west expected all the media coverage to be one big cheerleading squad for the trump administration that didn t fly with tapper  that s a lovely spin  but that s not what he was saying kellyanne   tapper said  reminding her that trump literally accused the media of not reporting on these attacks and then tapper went for the jugular and demanded to know why trump has remained silent about a terrorist attack in quebec  canada that was committed against a mosque by a white right wing trump fan  president trump has not said or tweeted one public word about this   tapper said   you want to talk about ignoring terrorism  why hasn t the president offered his sympathy to our neighbors in the north  mic  dropped conway tried to claim that trump is opposed to any loss of life  but the fact is that while he constantly whines about petty things on twitter on a daily basis  he couldn t even be bothered to say anything about the attack in quebec  in fact  all of the terrorist attacks trump listed were committed by muslim extremists  conveniently ignoring the higher number of terrorist attacks committed by white right wingers in this country tapper even noted that trump found time to tweet about the attack at the louvre in paris in which no lives were lost but completely ignored the quebec attack that killed six innocent people here s the video via youtube seriously  cnn and every other media outlets should permanently ban kellyanne conway from appearing on their programming  even when confronted with the truth she continues to lie for donald trump and then spins by whining about media coverage  it s the only play she has in her playbook and it is embarrassing and pathetic featured image  screenshot
