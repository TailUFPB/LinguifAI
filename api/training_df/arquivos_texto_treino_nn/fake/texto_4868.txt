indiana gov  mike pence is probably privately wishing he had never been tapped to be donald trump s running mate  thanks to trump s erratic behavior and many outrageous  offensive statements  pence is put into the position of defending him constantly   and some things are just not defensible  nonetheless  pence at least has to try  appearing on cnn s state of the union sunday morning  pence was forced to respond to the accusations of racism that democratic nominee hillary clinton leveled at trump in a blistering takedown that used the tycoons own words and actions to make the case that he s running to be racist in chief  hilariously  pence dismissed the speech as desperation  i think sen   kaine s  comments  hillary clinton s comments on thursday night sound desperate to me  the fact that you see democrats and hillary clinton and her running mate rolling out the same old playbook of racial divisiveness sounds a little bit to me like an act of desperation  the american people are sick and tired of politicians who seek to divide the people of this country to unite their supporters  pence then took the whole  make america great again  tack  and said he finds the accusations offensive  well  gov  pence  your running mate has one hell of a long list of racism  here s just a few examples i think we all know that i could go on forever regarding trump s racism  that s just a sampling  off of the top of my head  now  gov  pence  please defend these actions as  not racist   oh  that s right  you can t  because these are racist actions  and you know it  however  because you ve been brought on to the trump campaign to essentially be a pooper scooper  you can t admit that you are  indeed  trying to get a dyed in the wool  bona fide racist elected as president  watch pence s remarks below  https   twitter com cnnpolitics status  image via ty wright bloomberg via getty images
