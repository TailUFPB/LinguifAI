one of the major issues of the  campaign was trump s taxes  and the reason everyone made such a big deal of it was the fact that  except for a financial disclosure that was about as vague as possible  he was being as opaque as he could  it s hard to trust someone who s that opaque  for applicants for his transition team and administration  they have to be transparent about it  which reveals massive double standards on trump s part the transition team s website  greatagain gov  says  financial holdings and sources of income must be disclosed  any conflicts must be remedied by divestiture  the creation of special trusts  and other actions  okay  so they can do that with financial disclosures rather than their tax returns  in fact  they ll be required to file those financial disclosures  but then there s this  which is where trump s hypocrisy comes in  you will be asked about possible conflicts of interest deriving from your sources of income  all aspects of your personal and professional life  including organization  which you belong or once belonged  speeches you may have given and books  articles and editorials you may have written  legal  administrative and regulatory proceedings to which you may have been a party  in short  anything that might embarrass the president or you if he should choose you for a position in his administration  this refers  in part  to the sf   which is required for anyone in order to gain a security clearance  the kicker is this  even knowing that these job candidates have to give out sensitive and detailed information about their lives  it shows that trump is applying a different set of standards to himself than those by which his workforce must abide trump gets away with being opaque to everyone and probably pats himself on the back for it  and can continue to be so while his candidates will have to be forthcoming and detailed  he can even continue to lie about things that are important to gain the public s trust  his candidates nope the sf  is ridiculously thorough  and it s an ungodly pain in the ass to fill out because of that  even through the online e qip system  it asks for a lot of financial information  along with just about everything else that was ever in your life  including bankruptcies  tax liens  repossessions  judgments entered against you  and more  a lot of this is information that trump has flatly lied about  denied  or downplayed  his candidates don t have that luxury information provided on the sf  is covered under the privacy act  so his candidates  info will not be made public  even through a foia request  someone handling those forms and investigations would have to get stupid in order for that info to be made public the double standard remains  though  trump is a hypocrite who is already making it clear that he won t live or govern by the same standards that everyone else must live and or govern  that s absurd featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
