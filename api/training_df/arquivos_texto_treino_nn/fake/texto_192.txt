 i like your christ  i do not like your christians  your christians are so unlike your christ  that s a pretty easy quote from gandhi to understand  the man was complicated and problematic in a lot of ways  but this one quote never loses its edge for me  because it s so simple i have no doubt  however  that firebrand gop senate hopeful roy moore would dismiss it as the ramblings of a skinny brown cultist  i mean  hinduism has to be a cult  since there s no story of a savior coming back from the dead  no fire and brimstone and angry gods  i mean  there are  but not roy s angry god roy s angry god is apparently the guy responsible for the murders of  children and six teachers at sandy hook elementary five years ago this december  you see  roy s god is the one from the old testament of the bible  and the book that roy gets this particular idea from was apparently written  years before christ came around  laws were different then  you couldn t eat shrimp or cut your hair at the temples  and i guess if you were a biblical lady  you probably should have been essentially in hiding the entire time you menstruated  because holy shit  was that frowned on in fact  that book of the bible  hosea  has  verses in it  and they re essentially all about how terrible everyone is  and how god wants to smite them because they don t love him enough they turned away from the laws of god  you see  and that meant the almighty laid the smack down on them  translated into current context  roy moore says  that means god instructed adam lanza to pull the trigger on those children and eventually himself  because america  like the northern kingdom of israel before her  is worshiping false idols personally  i think hosea himself was just an angry dude  his wife  gomer  cheated on him  and god made him give his kids funny names  and he wasn t even sure if the last kid was his  well  the story s pretty convoluted  really  but suffice it to say  if i had been designated as one of god s main spokesmen and i was going through some shit like hosea was  i can imagine telling my wife that all the bad things happening to her were happening because she was a sinner it s not very christian  though in fact  it s pretty gross  here s video of the guy who s probably going to win a senate seat in alabama telling a church in the town of guin that god murders children when he s angry on tv today we played footage i found of roy moore saying the newtown  ct  shooting happened because we forgot god s law  pic twitter com    andrew kaczynski   kfile  september    know the bible is a long book  but let s hope roy gets to the new testament soon featured image via scott olson getty images
