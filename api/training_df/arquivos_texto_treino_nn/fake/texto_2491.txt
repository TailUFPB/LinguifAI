if any other american company did this  donald trump would be attacking them on twitter but trump has a double standard when it comes to his own business and the businesses owned by his family members as you may recall  trump has openly attacked ford  general motors  and a slew of other companies for building factories overseas instead of building them here and hiring american workers to do the jobs trump even attacked a japanese automaker for building a factory in mexico instead of in the united states the hypocrisy here is that while trump is attacking these companies for not hiring americans  his own son is begging the labor department to let him hire foreign workers instead of giving jobs to americans eric trump owns trump vineyards  and for the second time he is asking the labor department to let him hire foreign workers according to the petition filed  the workers would be paid over   an hour to perform manual labor in cold weather  workers would also be exposed to chemicals and would have to lift up to  pounds of grapes onto a truck here s a screenshot of the specific section again  this is hypocritical  donald trump is constantly promising americans that he will make sure they have jobs but his own son wants to hire foreign workers this is yet another example of trump not following the rules he s setting for everyone else a real leader leads by example and if trump refuses to tell his own son to hire american workers why should companies like ford comply with his demands keep in mind that trump is ordering raids to round up undocumented immigrants because trump claims they take jobs away from americans  the reality  however  is that these immigrants take jobs that most americans do not want to perform  such as managing and harvesting crops  that doesn t mean there aren t american out there who wouldn t take them  and that means eric trump is taking jobs away from americans by trying to hire foreign workers instead  that s shameful  especially since his dad promised to put america first featured image via joe raedle getty images
