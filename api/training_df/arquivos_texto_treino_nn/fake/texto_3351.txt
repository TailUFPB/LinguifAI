if you listened to republicans and conservatives  you would probably believe that  voter fraud  is running rampant across america  as dead voters and other illegal votes rise up and jam polling places from coast to coast  winning elections for democrats at all levels as poor republicans sit and look on  completely helpless before the onslaught but as is so often the case with a lot republican hysteria  voter fraud claims are at best a tiny  minuscule  whimper  and not the national emergency you would assume it is based on fox news and the rest  the new york times looked into it after the  election  and they found nothing in an election in which more than   million americans cast ballots  election and law enforcement officials in  states and the district of columbia   democratic leaning  republican leaning and in between   said that so far they knew of no credible allegations of fraudulent voting  officials in another eight states said they knew of only one allegation but inquiries to all  states  every one but kansas responded   found no states that reported indications of widespread fraud  and while additional allegations could surface as states wind up postelection reviews  their conclusions are unlikely to change significantly the reality is  as far as statistics go  voter fraud may as well not exist it is such a small portion of the vote  yet it is repeatedly invoked by conservative republicans to pass measures such as voter id and limits on early voting why  because  voter fraud  is an excuse and a smoke screen for republican initiatives designed to cut down on the minority vote  particularly black americans  it is also used to limit voter registration among young voters  those segments have been targeted by the right for suppression because they vote overwhelmingly in favor of democrats conservatives believe that the best way to win an election is to stop certain key voting blocs from having their votes counted  and the phony  voter fraud  is a great way to get that to happen featured image via flickr
