former san francisco  quarterback colin kaepernick has been essentially blacklisted in the nfl for daring to kneel during the national anthem in order to protest police brutality against people of color  he was the original player to  takeaknee  and has paid dearly for it  however  since donald trump has seen fit to attack anyone daring to protest in this way  the tide on the anthem protests has taken on new life  after trump s original attacks  players throughout the league were taking knees last sunday  the attacks continued from trump this week  and players continued to defy trump  perhaps most notably  those on kaepernick s old team the  had an entire row of players kneeling during the anthem  right in front of those who chose to stand  however  despite choosing to stand  those players had their hands on the shoulders of those kneeling in solidarity  trump might continue to petulantly tweet at these people who are using their public platform to shine a light on the very serious and deadly issue of police brutality  but clearly things are not going in the way he had hoped then again  trump seems to think that everyone is as tone deaf and racist as he and his mouthbreathing  flag soaked base are  that is clearly not the case  though  newsflash  you orange fascist   the world is much less tolerant of bigotry than you might like to think  people are sick and tired of your screaming racism through your bullhorn and using the bully pulpit of the white house to attack anyone who would dare to do the right thing here good on these brave players  they ll surely be attacked for what they are doing once again  from donald trump s overly active twitter account  but  at the end of the day  they are the ones who are on the right side of history watch the video below  courtesy of the   official twitter together pic twitter com pwkdagudcq  san francisco      october    image via video screen capture
