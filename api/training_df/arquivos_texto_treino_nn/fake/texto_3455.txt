you know things are going badly for the gop president elect when even fox news begins to turn on him  in an interview with fox s chris wallace on fox news sunday  trump was grilled about his conflicts of interest and about his similar accusations toward hillary clinton wallace asked trump about his campaign manager  kellyanne conway  telling cnn that trump would continue his role as executive producer for celebrity apprentice in his  spare time   as well as the fact trump plans on keeping a stake in his real estate business while in the white house   isn t that a huge conflict of interest  sir   wallace asked trump s response was that it was okay because everyone in the world knows he s a big real estate tycoon and he denied that he will be involved in the management of the company to wallace s credit  and i don t say that often   the fox anchor countered that trump  hammered hillary clinton over the clinton foundation and pay to play  trump responded that that was  different because she takes massive amounts of money from foreign countries   that s not true  but fox didn t point that out wallace continued  noting that trump will also be making  massive amounts of money  because  foreign countries are already booking events at the trump hotel in d c    and that trump has  business operations  deals with foreign countries isn t this on steroids  trump was seemingly appalled  but wallace went on  saying that foreign governments were trying to curry favor with the united states through trump s hotels trump  though  made the claim that he is  turning down billions of dollars in deals  because of potential conflicts of interest  but he did claim that he didn t know if he d be  doing deals   and said that  under the law  he has  the right to do it   but he doesn t want to here s the video it s becoming increasingly clear that trump is a danger  not just for domestic policy  but that he and his conflicts of interest present a real threat to the world  this issue is resonating with the american people  nearly   of whom have expressed concern with trump s conflicts of interest  as for why fox is waking up to that reality now  and not before the election  well  perhaps they see it as their ticket out of a wildcard trump presidency  they would much rather deal with a president mike pence featured image via screenshot
