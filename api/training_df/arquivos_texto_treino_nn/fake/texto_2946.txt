clearly  fox host bill o reilly wasn t paying attention over the last eight years because if he had been paying attention  he would know that conservatives sought to delegitimize president obama repeatedly the principle claim  of course  was that president obama was not born in the united states  a conspiracy theory that donald trump adopted for his own gain and continued to repeat during the campaign  republicans in congress also repeatedly attempted to sabotage the country in order to make obama a one term president and even after winning a second term republicans continued to refuse to work with him in fact  republicans went so far as to pledge allegiance to foreign leaders like vladimir putin and benjamin netanyahu rather than acknowledge obama as their president republican racism and hatred toward president obama divided america for eight years  yet conservatives like o reilly have the gall to blame him for it  and now he is accusing those who oppose donald trump of sedition during an interview with a very unfunny dennis miller  who claims to be a comedian  o reilly asked if he believes the effort in opposition to trump is  anti american  do you believe that this whole movement to delegitimize donald trump is anti american   o reilly asked   would you say it s that bad  miller cracked another pathetic  joke  that not even o reilly could laugh at and o reilly continued by going a step further  these people want to delegitimize the whole election  the whole presidency  and i think it borders on sedition   he said miller then blamed president obama for how divided the country has become even though republicans were the ones who divided it in the first place and trump continued to divide it on the campaign trail here s the video via youtube bill o reilly  like most conservatives  are hypocrites  over the last eight years  they desperately tried to convince the american people that president obama was illegitimate in order to sabotage his presidency and i don t remember o reilly throwing out words like  sedition  to describe that un american effort the fact is that trump lost the popular vote by nearly  million votes  and his electoral win is one of the smallest on record  furthermore  the russians helped trump by launching cyber attacks against our country and spreading propaganda  and trump has done nothing but suck up to putin  proving that he ll be a russian puppet instead of the american president  but you ll only hear o reilly whine about how people aren t lining up to kiss trump s ass  well  he better buckle up because turnabout is fair play because if anyone is a true illegitimate president it s donald trump  and unlike the birther conspiracy  there is plenty of proof backed up by the intelligence community featured image  screenshot
