republicans say trump won because of the  economic anxiety   republicans say the democrats ignored the white working class in rust belt america  republicans say the democrats ignored manufacturing jobs and shipped them overseas thanks to trade deals only the facts are just the opposite as president obama prepares to leave office  the u s  manufacturing job opening has hit a nine year high  tripling from   in  to   in october of this year in april  as the primaries were underway  the rate hit over   however  even though openings reached    only   openings were filled  while a recovering economy  in which all households have been benefiting  is helping to fuel these job booms  a gap in job skills and a passive recruitment process is causing not every position to be filled jobs in manufacturing are paying more employees more money  back in   half of u s  manufacturing firms paid employees   or less  now  eight years later  only  percent of firms are paying less than   at the same time  unskilled workers are missing out on better opportunities while skilled positions aren t being filled  stifling a resurgence of manufacturing in the rust belt so while there are still plateaus the industry must overcome  the  economic anxiety  felt by the midwest that supposedly fueled trump s rise to the presidency has been based on a lie prorogated by conservative outlets like fox and trump himself  and a little by the far left  while democrats have been delivering to the rustbelt and fighting for the coal miners of west virginia  republicans have drummed up fear  lies and distrust to rise to power once again  president obama has cleaned up the republican party s mess   and just like with george w  bush  an incoming republican is going to wreck the democrat s progress let s hope the rustbelt doesn t suffer too badly from trump featured image via lisa dejong the plain dealer
