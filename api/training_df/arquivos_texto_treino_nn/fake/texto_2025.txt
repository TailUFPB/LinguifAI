msnbc host lawrence o donnell did not hold back on thursday night earlier in the day  house republican leadership saw the writing on the wall and canceled the vote on their healthcare bill so far   republicans are leaning against the legislation it does nothing that donald trump promised it would do like lower premiums and cover everyone indeed  the bill would make premiums skyrocket uncontrollably and would strip healthcare from over  million americans  senior citizens would suffer the brunt of the financial pain as they would would be charged ten times as much for health insurance under the bill than they are under the affordable care act  which really has made health insurance more accessible and affordable but after the vote in the house was canceled  trump lashed out at house republicans and demanded that a vote be taken on the bill on friday because he refuses to negotiate any longer on it so during his show on thursday night  lawrence o donnell took trump to the woodshed for quitting and noted that president obama never quit trying to get the affordable care act passed  if you are a house republican and this is a tough vote for you  the president is saying to you on the front page of the new york times tomorrow   i quit  and i quit in the senate  i do not have the patience or the ability to stay focused on this and get it through the senate   which is much harder than getting it through the house  o donnell is absolutely right  senate republicans are even more concerned about the trumpcare legislation  if passed  the damage will even touch their own voter base  which could result in the senate flipping back to the control of the democrats  the senate is much more vulnerable to being lost than the house is since republicans have guaranteed control of the house through gerrymandering but o donnell had even stronger words for trump just a few seconds later  this is the laziest  most ignorant president in history   o donnell declared   president obama never once said something like this in the crusade to get that thing passed because he knew how to stay with it and get it passed  here s the video via youtube trump is throwing a fit because he expects congress to ass whatever he wants them to pass and it just doesn t work that way  the congressional budget office analysis of the bill was disastrous for the gop  and the bill is hated more by americans than the affordable care act ever was  and thousands of their constituents have showed up at republican town halls across the country to express their anger over their effort to repeal the affordable care act in the end  letting this bill die is probably the best move republicans can make unless  of course  they propose replacing the affordable care act with universal healthcare  but we all know that will never happen even though it would cover everyone and bring the cost of healthcare down dramatically one thing is certain  though  when donald trump hears what o donnell just said about him his head is going to explode featured image via screenshot
