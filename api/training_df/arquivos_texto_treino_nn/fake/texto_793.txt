trump s brand new communications director  anthony scaramucci  is raising some eyebrows  and not because he s another former wall streeter  he supported both obama and hillary  and has expressed some considerably liberal views on things like gun laws and the  amendment  that may well put trump at war with the nra  because the nra is likely to see this as a betrayal of sorts in   scaramucci was very clear in his position on gun laws  and they do not match what the nra wants to see in the white house at all image via twitterhe also told all of twitter that he s always supported strong gun laws  the nra hates any gun laws   in fact  they like to push lawmakers to loosen them in response to mass shootings image via twitterso  of course  nra spokeswoman dana loesch isn t exactly thrilled with scaramucci s appointment  she s hoping that he s changed his position since then  because  after all  the only things that matter to the nra types are guns  lives  safety  well  those are just collateral damage in the fight for freedom loesch and the nra have been under fire recently for a patently disgusting ad calling liberal protesters  messages the  violence of lies   and that also said that liberals  assassinate the truth   she says that it s up to real americans to fight the violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth  it s not hard to interpret that as a call to eliminate liberals scaramucci is  crazily enough  someone that trump believes will be loyal to him  first and foremost and above everything else  will he actually do that  though  maybe  he ll have to do a complete  on issues like gun control  which then throws his convictions and credibility into doubt  who will come out on top when all is said and done  only time will tell featured image via scott olson getty images
