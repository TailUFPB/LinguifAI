once again president elect donald trump has dominated the media by doing something incredibly dumb  after whining about the recount effort by green party candidate jill stein on twitter  trump kept the pity party going by whining about how he lost the popular vote but of course  trump is so delirious that he had to come up with an excuse for why he d lost by over  million votes  to save himself from having to face the fact that most of america hates him  trump promoted a ridiculous right wing conspiracy theory about voter fraud  alleging that hillary clinton had won only because of  illegal  voters as soon as trump s little orange fingers could finish his tweet  everyone was all over it  election experts  historians  reporters and even other republicans have rushed to debunk trump s lies   and on monday  the hosts on abc s the view couldn t wait to tear trump a new one co host joy behar  who has been an amazing critic of trump in the past  said she was proud of the media for actually calling trump out and reporting that trump s claims had no evidence to support them  she congratulated news outlets for reporting the truth when she said  the news divisions are now stating that it s a lie  like  now they re saying  with no evidence    it s not true   which is what they should have been doing all year when politifact said he was lying  but now they re starting to say   this is a lie  this is a lie  this is a lie  whoopi goldberg also jumped in  just as irritated by trump s nonstop lying  she said  there is no evidence anywhere   anywhere    that anyone voted illegally  donald  and then  she asked what most of us have been wondering when she questioned why trump was so afraid of a vote recount  now more than ever  it s becoming obvious that trump is terrified of what the recount might determine  and that he might lose his chance to make america white again you can watch  the view  blast trump below featured image via screenshot and win mcnamee   getty images
