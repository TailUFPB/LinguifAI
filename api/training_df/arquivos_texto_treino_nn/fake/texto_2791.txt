donald trump took to twitter to defend his muslim ban on sunday morning and got his ass handed to him by pissed off americans on friday  trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people from seven countries from entering the united states just because they happen to be muslims trump claims that the order is necessary to keep americans safe  but none of the countries listed are responsible for terrorist attacks against american citizens  in fact  all of the mass shootings in cities like orlando  ft  hood  and san bernardino were carried out by natural born american citizens  furthermore  trump left saudi arabia off the list even though the   hijackers originated from and were funded by the saudis in short  trump s order does not keep america safe and has only caused chaos around the world while violating the rights of americans but trump dared to defend his ban anyway our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting  now  look what is happening all over europe and  indeed  the world   a horrible mess   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    that our country already has strong borders and immigrants already go through extreme vetting to get here  refugees have to wait up to two years while they are strenuously investigated by several government agencies  terrorism won t stop because of a wall or more vetting  but it will increase because trump s ban will be used as propaganda by terrorist organizations to justify more attacks against america and the reality is that trump s order has made the world a bigger mess because people and businesses are scrambling to deal with the complications and families are experiencing fear that they ll never see their loved ones again due to the ban  airports across the country are also a mess because people are being detained and blocked from entering the country  even those who have green cards and are permanent residents the american people are already sick and tired of trump and they absolutely put a boot up his ass on twitter  realdonaldtrump the people your order blocks from entering the us have lived here legally  sometimes for decades   hank green   hankgreen  january    realdonaldtrump they
