house republicans  finally  unveiled their repeal and replace healthcare plan  much to the fury of all the people who will be hurt by the gop s insistence on giving massive blow jobs to their corporate overlords  some republicans aren t behind it  but many are  and then there are some that have drafted their own bill  like rep  pete sessions of texas  not to be confused with embattled attorney general  jeff sessions  he introduced his own healthcare legislation on march   and he calls it the  world s greatest healthcare plan of    seriously  that s the actual name of the bill  this isn t from the onion  or something that snopes or politifact are going to rate as false  pete sessions literally named it the  world s greatest healthcare plan of   while that sounds egotistical enough to be the same bill that the house unveiled earlier this week  it s not  sessions also never meant it to compete with the ahca  which is the republicans  current plan with which to repeal the affordable care act  pete sessions does support that bill and hopes it passes his own bill  the  world s greatest healthcare plan of    has similar provisions to the ahca  because of course it does  it would eliminate the individual and employer mandates  expand health savings accounts  which he apparently thinks promotes accountability   turns the premium subsidies into tax credits that are absolute baloney  and so forth so it s another version of obamacare lite  which republicans like rand paul despise because the ahca is not the full repeal that they promised the american people  but a full  clean repeal like paul wants is impossible now  but that name   the one sessions put on his own  really  that s seriously something that donald trump would do  despite the name  sessions  spokesperson says he really believes in the gop s plan  and believes that both are the greatest healthcare bills  his just has a more ridiculous name  and it s not the first time he s introduced it  he actually introduced  the world s greatest healthcare plan of   last year perhaps his next bill will be one to amend the ahca to be called the  world s greatest healthcare plan of    we need to pick our jaws up off the floor featured image by alex wong via getty images
