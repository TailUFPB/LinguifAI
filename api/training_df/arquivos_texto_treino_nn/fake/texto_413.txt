donald trump sure knows how to add insult to injury republicans in congress must be seriously regretting their decision to endorse trump now after they were totally humiliated on thursday at the white house during a meeting inside the oval office to discuss debt ceiling proposals  trump stunned paul ryan and mitch mcconnell by taking a deal offered by the democrats which increases the debt ceiling for three months and provides texas with hurricane harvey relief with no strings attached  republicans were hoping for an  month increase and wanted to hold hurricane relief hostage in order to get concessions from the democrats on other issues but trump pulled the rug out from under them because he knows that republicans are incapable of governing even with majority control of the house and senate and that s why trump kicked republicans while they were down on friday morning  suggesting he took the democrats  offer because of republican failures to pass legislation  he then whined about the filibuster and asked republicans to work on tax reform and get it done before the end of the month republicans  sorry  but i ve been hearing about repeal   replace for  years  didn t happen  even worse  the senate filibuster rule will    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    never allow the republicans to pass even great legislation   dems control   will rarely get   vs    votes  it is a repub death wish   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    must start the tax reform tax cut legislation asap  don t wait until the end of september  needed now more than ever  hurry   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    are not going to get tax reform done by the end of the month  they have even passed the debt ceiling bill with hurricane harvey relief yet  the gop is a fractured party right now  the majority of whom are controlled by an extremist base trump would be better off working with the democrats  he d not only get things done  he would be able to sign legislation that is far better for the country featured image  alex wong getty images
