defending satan is hard  that s what kellyanne conway learned during an appearance on msnbc on wednesday morning with eleven hours to go before the third presidential debate kicks off  host stephanie ruhle relentlessly grilled donald trump s campaign manager on everything from the republican nominee s claims that the election is  rigged  to the sexual assault allegations against him to him inviting president obama s estranged half brother to the debate ruhle began by asking conway if she really believes there will be widespread fraud on election day  conway responded by breaking with her boss   no  i don t believe that   she said but she went on to suggest that there is a conspiracy to defeat trump among clinton and some members of the media  specifically  conway cited james o keefe and his selectively edited undercover videos as proof of trump s claims ruhle called out trump for misleading the american people  conway tried to spin by pointing to trump s recent introduction of an ethics plan for government  but ruhle was skeptical because trump could have introduced such a plan months ago but is only doing it now conway whined about how the media is supposedly ignoring trump s plans but ruhle was not having it  noting that while the media has covered trump s policy plans  he has made it difficult for them to do so by making wild claims and saying offensive things such as his various insults aimed at women  which ruhle talked about next ruhle asked conway if she is offended by trump s remark about grabbing women  by the pussy   she acknowledged that she is offended but she also lied by claiming that no one in trump s campaign has tried to defend or condone his remarks when many of his surrogates have tried to write off his comments as mere  locker room talk  ruhle then moved on to the sexual allegations against trump  especially those made by a people magazine contributor  trump has repeatedly called her a liar and attacked her but it turns out there are six witnesses who can corroborate her accusations that he groped her and forcibly tried to kiss her  when there are six people corroborating the people magazine story you still say her word against his   ruhle said   you ve got to look at your kids when you go home at night  conway complained that it was fair for ruhle to say that to her because  i get that from a lot of childless people worrying about my kids  but ruhle actually has three kids  whom she says are not allowed to watch trump speak because she is afraid he will say offensive things about women conway countered by claiming that hillary clinton has not done anything for women  which again  is a lie according to huffington post globally  no candidate has done more for women s rights than secretary clinton  in her time as secretary of state  she appointed the first ever ambassador at large for global women s issues at the state department  oversaw the creation of the u s  national action plan on women  peace  and security  and introduced the global health initiative  ghi   investing   billion to help partner countries provide robust maternal and infant health services hillary is also a strong supporter of the equal rights amendment and voted for the lily ledbetter act and paycheck fairness act when she was a united states senator she also fought for over the counter contraception and expanding medicaid for family planning services in short  her record of achievement is long when it comes to women conway also bragged about hillary clinton not reaching  percent support among women  but the fact is that she has a  point lead over trump among women   in a new cbs poll  if the election were held today  it would be the largest margin of victory among women in history  even surpassing president obama s wins in  and  for some reason  conway also tried to criticize hillary for  hanging out  with billionaires like mark cuban just because she has their support  ruhle was quick to smack conway down by pointing out that trump is a billionaire who actually does hang out with billionaires conway also took heavy fire from ruhle after saying that hillary clinton  isn t an american success story  even though she is the first woman in history to be a major party s nominee for president here s the video via youtube overall  conway really took a beating in this interview  she lied multiple times all while trying to soften trump s claims  which really undermines them more than anything else donald trump is unfit to be president and  quite frankly  anyone who worked for his campaign should never be able to work in politics or in the media ever again  and that includes kellyanne conway  they have done nothing but poison the democratic process while demonizing the press that is responsible for vetting candidates  that only weakens our country and it s unforgivable featured image via screenshot
