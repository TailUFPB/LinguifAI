donald trump s scandal ridden  chaotic white house has recently been thrown into further disarray as people who worked on his campaign have faced indictments from special counsel robert mueller s team  his former campaign chair paul manafort was taken into federal custody this past monday  as was manafort s sidekick and trump adviser rick gates  foreign policy adviser george padadopuolos pled guilty to charges he was facing  and is now cooperating with mueller s team  now  nbc news is reporting that disgraced former national security adviser michael flynn is under mueller s gun as well  because there is now enough evidence to charge flynn in this oh so hot investigation into collusion between the trump campaign and the russian government according to nbc news  mueller is pressuring flynn to cooperate  because there is a person near and dear to flynn s heart who could be in trouble  his own son  michael g  flynn  the younger michael flynn worked on the campaign and the trump transition team  if the elder flynn cooperates with team mueller  he just might be able to save his son from hard prison time  most parents would definitely be up for limiting the legal consequences of something this serious for their children  this is very bad news for the trump white house  because michael flynn was very close to donald trump during the campaign and worked in the white house as national security adviser for  days  he clearly knows a lot  and if it means that sharing that information would keep his son out of federal prison  he ll likely be more than willing to share that information with special counsel robert mueller s team this is all very bad news for the trump white house  but very good news for the country  the more people mueller flips  the closer we are to removing this criminal administration this is a developing story  stay tuned to addicting info for updates featured image via kevin hagen getty images
