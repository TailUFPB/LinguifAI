on saturday  green party candidate jill stein tried to explain why she met with russian president vladimir putin before the election  when asked about the meeting by cnn host michael smerconish  she used the most logical defense  blame hillary clinton and the democrats  because  of course  take me inside the dinner you had with vladimir putin in  and the prominence it afforded you   smerconish said to stein   my question is was that in and of itself a form of meddling along the lines of  let me give some attention to green party candidate jill stein    you know the theory   any vote for stein that otherwise would have gone to hillary  what was that dinner about  let s be clear  that was a conference   stein replied   that picture didn t start to circulate until long after the election  it essentially wasn t covered here in the u s  there was media at that conference  and it was a day long conference where my message was very clear  it was the message of my campaign  which is that we need a peace offensive in the middle east  now  this was a message that was particularly friendly to the russians  it was saying to them that we need to stop the bombing  they had just begun bombing in syria  i would have loved for that message to have gotten out but there s basically zero coverage   she continued   it s now circulating  it s funny  michael  you have to ask why is that picture kicking up a storm right now  i think it s very related to the fact that the democrats are looking for someone to blame  naturally  no big deal that she was buddying up to putin while he was hacking the democrats and meddling in our election to get trump into the white house  nothing to see here folks  nothing at all you can watch stein blame the democrats for her russian rendezvous below  featured image via video screen capture
