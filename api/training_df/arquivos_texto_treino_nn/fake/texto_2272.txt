donald trump s surrogates are desperately trying to defend him after he leveled some pretty serious charges at president obama based on what he read in a far right propaganda rag  according to the donald  president obama ordered the  wires  at trump tower  tapped   he provided no evidence  of course  but white house officials confirm that the donald got his  information  from breitbart  however  it doesn t seem that his surrogates want to admit where he gets what he thinks are facts on monday  deputy white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders did her best to defend trump  the president firmly believes the obama administration may have tapped into the phones at trump tower   sanders told  today  anchor savannah guthrie  and is that based on media reports   guthrie asked  referencing the breitbart piece that had been circulating among trump s staff just before his twitter outburst  this is something we should look into  we d like to know for sure   sanders replied   look  the media has been extremely dismissive of this reporting and this potential story  while all the while being very happy to jump on all of the false attacks that have been launched at this president over the last six months  just so we re clear on this one  specific point   is his information  that president obama tapped his phone  based solely on something he read in the media   guthrie pressed  look  i haven t had the chance to have that conversation directly with the president   sanders said   he s got much higher classification than i   so he may have access to the documents that i don t know about  but i do know that we take this very seriously  and we think it should be thoroughly reviewed and investigated  but  of course  level of classification does not matter because the information came from a report by an outlet that serves as  the platform for the alt right   alt right is the soft term for  nazis   according to white house chief strategist steve bannon when he was head honcho of the publication  worse yet  the claim was based on the words of a known conspiracy theorist who now admits he can t back his allegations  but  like trump  he says he really wants to know if obama did tap trump tower s  wires  despite the complete lack of evidence  trump demanded that republicans investigate obama   and they say they will  anything to distract from the very real problem of the trump administration s troubling ties with russia  right watch the exchange below  is that the source of this information  strictly from media reports   not from any other source    savannahguthrie asks  sarahhuckabee pic twitter com   today   todayshow  march    image via screengrab
