this is hypocrisy of the highest order and proves that donald trump would only make a mockery of our government institutions if he became president the republican nominee has made hillary clinton s emails one of his central campaign talking points  much to the delight of his rally crowds who chant  lock her up  at every opportunity because they think she somehow broke the law even though it has been determined by law enforcement that she has not trump has called hillary s email circus  worse than watergate   which has drawn sharp criticism from anyone with a fully functioning brain  including former watergate prosecutor nick akerman  who called the comparison absurd as it turns out  donald trump has his own email scandal that really did break the law according to newsweek   trump s companies have systematically destroyed or hidden thousands of emails  digital records and paper documents demanded in official proceedings  often in defiance of court orders  since  when he and his father fought the federal government after they got caught discriminating against african americans when it came to housing again  we are talking about thousands of emails and documents that multiple judges ordered trump and his companies to provide to the court  yet trump flouted the orders and had the evidence destroyed rather than produce something in court that might help his opponent win the case this is what is known as  spoliation of evidence  which  is the intentional  reckless  or negligent withholding  hiding  altering  fabricating  or destroying of evidence relevant to a legal proceeding  such actions are a criminal act and are punishable by a fine or imprisonment as many times as trump has committed these acts  he should have been behind bars by now  and he certainly should not be allowed to be president  because it s clear that trump has no problem ordering his employees to break the law and would most definitely run one of the most secretive administrations in american history  transparency would no longer exist because trump hides anything that could hurt him he has already demonstrated this behavior on the campaign trail by refusing to release his tax returns and his medical records  and now we know that trump regularly destroys documents and email evidence despite such evidence being ordered provided by a court of law hillary clinton s emails were a one time mistake that other former secretaries of state have made  including colin powell and condoleezza rice  both of whom are republicans who served in republican administrations  nobody made a fuss when they used private servers  yet trump and his rabid fans are whining about hillary doing the same thing  if anything  hillary clinton is way more transparent than trump has ever been  she didn t permanently delete the emails  they have all been recovered  which means there wasn t an actual effort to nefariously hide anything  furthermore  she has released her medical records and tax returns  and she has never destroyed evidence in defiance of a court order so while trump s supporters are chanting  lock her up   it s actually donald trump who should be in prison right now featured image  spencer platt getty images
