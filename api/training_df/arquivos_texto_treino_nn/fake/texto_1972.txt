as donald trump continues to take criticism from the press over his scandalous ties to russia  the ladies of the view noticed that one network is deafeningly silent ever since fbi director james comey confirmed that trump is being investigated for colluding with russia during the  campaign  the scandal has only widened as house intelligence chairman rep  devin nunes demonstrated that he s more interested in derailing the investigation than he is in pursuing it nunes has canceled hearings that would have shined more light on trump s scandal and he also went to the white house to personally inform trump about the committee s investigation  which is highly unethical and proves that republicans are incapable of running this investigation indeed  nunes own ties to russia and putin have been recently revealed  as it turns out  nunes owns part of a winery that is connected to a russian investor who is close to putin  furthermore  nunes served on trump s transition team  so it s clear that nunes has a lot to lose if he allows the investigation to move forward but even though the evidence against trump is piling up and republicans have been caught engaging in an attempted cover up  fox news is not screaming about it nearly as much as they were screaming about benghazi the hosts of view tackled fox  trump  and nunes during their show on tuesday  and it wasn t pretty either as even the most conservative hosts on the program agreed that something smells awfully fishy first  whoopi goldberg slammed trump for calling his russia scandal a  hoax  if it is a hoax  don t you want them to investigate and clear your name  my friend   she quipped joy behar pointed out that trump is a  serial liar  so he has zero credibility on this issue  first of all  we know he s a committed serial liar  so when he says it s a hoax  he means it s not a hoax   she said sunny hostin  who is an attorney  chimed in by attacking nunes for sneaking off to the white house to inform trump on what his committee is doing and noted that nunes could also be in trouble because he may have been caught on a wiretap talking to russian officials since he was making calls as part of trump s transition team  indeed  nunes  connections to russia and putin combined with his unwillingness to run a fair and unbiased investigation should force him to recuse himself and step down from the house intelligence committee then whoopi goldberg and jedediah bila teamed up to hammer fox news  why isn t fox screaming about this   goldberg asked   they screamed about benghazi  she s right  fox news constantly talked about benghazi as if it was the scandal to beat all scandals  in the end  it was only a republican witch hunt against hillary clinton and no wrongdoing was found but donald trump has serious connections to russia and vladimir putin and it has been proven that russia interfered in the  election on trump s behalf  especially after trump asked them to continue hacking our institutions  several of trump s aides and closest advisers have been revealed as having significant ties to putin  including michael flynn  paul manafort  and carter page  even trump s son in law took a meeting with a russian banker who has close ties to putin if you have a brain right now and you re a functioning person  the word  russia  has come up way too many times with this administration   bila pointed out before referencing putin   that name is showing up too much for me to be comfortable right now  here s the video via youtube it s time for congress to let an independent commission take over the investigation from the house intelligence committee  nunes has zero credibility and he has proven that he s nothing but a trump stooge  a special prosecutor should also be appointed tot eh investigation  donald trump s russia scandal has raged on for months and it s only getting bigger and bigger despite how much republicans have been dragging their feet  if hillary clinton were in the white house right now  republicans would have triggered investigation after investigation over the tiniest hints of a scandal  but donald trump is embroiled in a real scandal that threatens to topple our country to putin s advantage and republicans are reluctant to do anything about it because it threatens their power  not only should trump be investigated  republicans in congress should be investigated for being complicit featured image via screenshot
