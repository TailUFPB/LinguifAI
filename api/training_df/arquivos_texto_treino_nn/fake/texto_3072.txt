alabama senator jeff sessions  who is donald trump s nominee to be attorney general  faced the senate judiciary committee this morning  and  in typical republican fashion  he denied  deflected  and lied in his opening statements  sessions pointed to a number of issues currently facing the country  lgbt rights  voting rights  systemic racism  and religious freedom based on his moving speech  with his soft spoken southern demeanor  one wouldn t know who jeff sessions really is   an anti woman  anti lgbt  anti black  and anti immigrant demagogue take  for example  the comparing and contrasting of sessions  statements vs  the facts statement  a special priority for me in this regard will be aggressive enforcement of our laws to ensure access to the ballot for every eligible american voter  without hindrance or discrimination  and to ensure the integrity of the electoral process i deeply understand the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our african american brothers and sisters fact even though sessions voted to reauthorize it in   with reservations   the senator argued in  that the voting rights act was  engineering  a political outcome  and championed the repeal of sections  and  of the act  even while senator   which set up special protections in southern states to combat discriminatory voting practices that were regulated by the federal government  in   the supreme court repealed section   which rendered section  moot   a decision which has opened the floodgates to anti voting laws throughout the south  especially in north carolina  sessions cheered this on  calling it  good news for the south   this is what sessions fought for but failed in the senate in   sessions prosecuted three black men  which included mlk s former aid albert turner  on charges of voter fraud with very little evidence  the  marion three  as they became known as were renowned in their community for being voting rights and registration activists  they were acquitted by a jury after only three hours of deliberation  and sessions  while admitting he doesn t regret his decision  admitted he was shoddy in his approach  that s what the justice department needs   a shoddy attorney who might have wrongfully convicted black civil rights activists sessions  office also dropped the case with regards to a man who was lynched by the kkk  the members  who were caught  were eventually tried and convicted  but not by session s office sessions  as everyone knows  referred to the naacp as  un american  and then said it could be construed as being  un american  sessions also supports the discriminatory voter id laws  on the surface  how is attorney general sessions going to tackle the mounting anti voting laws being passed in southern states after the provisions he hated were gutted  how will he be able to divorce his decades long war against black activists who want the freedom to vote without  as sessions put it  hindrance or discrimination statement i understand the demands for justice and fairness made by the lgbt community facts senator sessions has a zero rating from the united states  largest gay rights advocacy group the human rights campaign  sessions opposes same sex marriage  same sex adoption rights  and voted against hate crimes preventions  he said such legislation would  cheapen civil rights  in america   he opposed the repeal of don t ask  don t tell  and supports a federal marriage amendment with regards to the possibility of a gay supreme court justice  sessions is on record saying   that would be a big concern that the american people might feel might feel uneasy about that  so  in a nutshell  no  sessions does not  understand  the demands of justice and fairness made by the lgbt community  he hears them  but he doesn t care about them or their rights  dignity and respect statement i understand the lifelong scars born by women who are victims of assault and abuse facts senator sessions voted against reauthorizing the violence against women act in   citing concerns about issues pertaining to tribal procedure  although the issues pertaining to lgbt women may have played a role in sessions   no  vote in october  when a video surfaced of donald trump bragging about grabbing a woman by the genitals  sessions was asked whether or not he believed such bragging constituted sexual assault  his response   i don t characterize that as sexual assault  i think that s a stretch   i don t know  it s not clear that he   how that would occur  sessions voted against the largest piece of legislation that helps combat abuse and defended his preferred candidate when it became evident he has sexually assaulted at least one woman in his lifetime sessions lied through his teeth in his confirmation hearing  he has absolutely no idea as to the plight of women  african americans  gays  or anyone else for that matter  he has inflated his record  he has miscategorized his past statements and votes  and he would be the most ass backwards thinking attorney general in years we cannot let him get away with his revisionist history featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
