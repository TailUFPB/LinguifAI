senator lindsey graham  r sc  has never been a fan of donald trump  he regularly criticized trump throughout his disastrous campaign and very publicly refused to support him or vote for him  now that we are six months into this american nightmare of a  presidency   it seems that senator graham is more than done with trump  when asked about trump s repeated attacks on attorney general jeff sessions  as well as his flagrant attempts to impede and obstruct special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation  graham did not mince words  speaking to reporters on thursday  graham said  if jeff sessions is fired  there will be holy hell to pay  he went on to say that trump is clearly trying to  humiliate  and  marginalize  his own attorney general  after that  he said that any attempts to fire mueller could be the beginning of the end of the trump presidency  that s about as blatant a threat of impeachment as any gop lawmaker has lobbed at trump  it seems that graham is finally standing up and actually telling his gop colleagues that protecting our democracy is much more important than protecting trump  throughout the campaign and now as he occupies the oval office  trump has proven himself to be unfit  he has careened from outrage to outrage  and increasingly lessened america s standing on the world stage now  it seems even his own party is sick of him  just wednesday night  senate judiciary chairman chuck grassley warned trump that he would not confirm an attorney general this year if trump fires sessions  now  we have lindsey graham insisting that trump must stop trying to turn america into a banana republic trump would do well to listen to these men  there s a reason congress is article  of the constitution  and the presidency is article   they can kneecap him in a minute if pushed  and it seems that trump is very close to crossing that red line with lindsey graham watch the stunning video below featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
