we recently reported on how it has now come to light  thanks to the wonderful investigative reporting at the new yorker  that donald trump is involved in some seriously shady business dealings  in one instance  he has a hotel that seems to be nothing more than a front for shady ties to the iranian revolutionary guard  which is considered to be a sponsor of terrorism  the people who signed off on the hotel deal also are corrupt as all hell  and seem to get their money by laundering it via government corruption  well  there is one person in the news business who always breaks this stuff down in the best way possible  msnbc s rachel maddow on thursday s edition of the rachel maddow show  the fiery host explains the situation with trump and his family s ties and how it could make trump vulnerable to blackmail by these dangerous foreign terrorists  of course  with trump being president  that means the danger also extends to the american people  according to maddow  this deal is so potentially dangerous that senator sherrod brown  d oh   actually wants a whole new investigation just for this shady sham of a hotel deal another interesting tidbit that maddow points out is the fact that it is illegal for american business people to do business with foreign entities that have been sanctioned due to terrorist ties  in fact  it s seen as such an egregious crime that if caught  one faces serious jail time  hopefully  trump s clear incompetence forces him to slip up on this one  and he winds up in prison  right where he belongs there s no one like rachel maddow to explain something like this  though  so  without further ado  here is the video featured image via video screen capture
