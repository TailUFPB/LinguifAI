it s pretty clear that donald trump has no idea how the country works  or what is actually in the us constitution earlier today  trump attacked nbc news for reporting unflattering   but true   content about him  the network had first infuriated trump several days ago when it reported that his secretary of state had called him a  moron   and most recently the network enraged trump again by reporting on the reason rex tillerson called trump a moron   which was because trump wanted to increase the us nuclear arsenal tenfold  for no other reason than because his fragile ego can t handle it  trump reacted to that story by threatening to take away the press  broadcasting license trump made things even worse as the day went on when he actually said   it s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write  and people should look into it  understandably  there was a huge uprising in opposition to all of this  with one of the most brilliant responses coming from cnn s jake tapper  during the opening of his show the lead  tapper responded to trump by telling him to go read the constitution  with a pocket constitution in hand  tapper told trump   you might want to start looking into it too  mr  president  you can watch tapper shred trump below trump says it s  disgusting  that the press can write whatever they want   people should look into it  so we did  and you should too  pic twitter com   the lead cnn   theleadcnn  october    needs to be reminded that he isn t a dictator and that he cannot take away the media s freedom of speech just because he doesn t like what s being written about him  if he actually cared that much  perhaps trump might have better luck if he actually did his job and stopped acting like a baby featured image is a screenshot
