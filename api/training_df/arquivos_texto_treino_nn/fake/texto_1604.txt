former secretary of state madeleine albright weighed in on donald trump s remarks about what a brilliant leader he thinks kim jong un is  including his comment that he would be ever so  honored  to meet with him  her take on the situation is that trump needs to stay the hell away from the north korean dictator  far  far away  a president doesn t go to a country without any preparation  and  honored  would definitely be the wrong way to discuss somebody who is keeping his people in poverty and starving and control   albright told cnn s jake tapper on tuesday trump has repeatedly gushed about how much he loves various autocrats from around the world and recently he has been singing the praises of kim jong un  on sunday  he said on cbs  face the nation that the murderous leader was a  smart cookie   you know  for killing off family members to stay in power and other fun stuff like that  then  on monday  trump told bloomberg that he would be  honored  to meet with kim jong un if the  circumstances  happened to be right albright slammed trump for kissing up to dictators  especially the likes of kim jong un  i think that part of the issue is that president trump seems to believe that he can have just one on one relationships  and maybe that s possible in business  but that is not something that is possible as president of the united states   she said   this is not a matter of charming  by saying you re  honored  and he s a  smart cookie   the former secretary of state has spoken out against trump and his piss poor excuse for foreign policy from the very beginning of his candidacy  tuesday s comments come amid rising tensions between the u s  and north korea over pyongyang s weapons program you can watch albright s entire interview here featured image via video screen capture
