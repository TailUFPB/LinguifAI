in   shortly after donald trump announced that he d be running for president  i went to one of his rallies in sarasota  florida  while standing outside of the rally it struck me as hilarious that the people who attended genuinely believed this self proclaimed multi billionaire was just like them  when trump s helicopter flew over our heads with his name scrawled across it and he offered his supporters  children rides in his chopper  it cemented the fact that he was totally just like them  it was one of the most bizarre experiences of my life  and i live in florida so that says a lot in the months since that day  the same narrative has been repeated far and wide  at the republican national convention  trump s daughter ivanka told the gop that her dad was the  people s champion  there is a facebook page called  trump  the people s president and there are blue collar workers all over the country who think the real estate mogul is  just like us   these people think that just because he is a loudmouth who lacks a vocal filter that he is some kind of  everyman   but he s not so  we have decided to compose a list of some of the things the working poor face every day that trump has never had to deal with in his life it is a fact that nowadays there is no chance of upward mobility without an education  this reality is the reason why democrats are fighting so hard to make college free or at the very least  affordable  for every american  although parents know that the only chance their kids have of achieving success is by going to college  when you are living below or just above the poverty line there is no way you can put money away for their college education  this is the reason we have   trillion dollars in student loan debt in the country and a student loan debt crisis  donald trump  however  has no idea what this is like  all of his children went to prestigious schools  the wharton school and georgetown  and so did he  he doesn t know the guilt you experience as a parent when you see your child stressed out about their mounting debt  he absolutely cannot wrap his mind around this and he isn t even talking about it in his campaign which proves that not only does he not understand it  he doesn t care according to a  pew research study   percent of americans said they take public transportation on a regular basis  the people who take the bus or subway on a regular basis are also more likely to be minorities or elderly who live below the poverty line among urban residents    of blacks and   of hispanics report taking public transit daily or weekly  compared with only   of whites  foreign born urban residents are more likely than urban dwellers born in the u s  to regularly use public transportation    vs     meanwhile  trump  the everyman  flies around the country in a jet or uses a chauffeured car  this man has absolutely no idea what it feels like to wake up three hours before his shift at work so that he can make sure that he is on time  he has no idea what it is like to wait for the bus in a thunder or snow storm  he has no idea what it is like to sit next to weirdos who invade your personal space and stare at you  he has no idea what it is like to worry about whether or not he will have the    it costs to ride the bus  and again he isn t talking about this on the campaign trail and he is against raising the minimum wage since president obama s affordable healthcare act went into effect millions of americans finally have the medical insurance they desperately need  but many still do not  more than  million people are still without insurance in our country  that means millions of people are not getting the annual physical exams they need to stay healthy this is not something trump has to deal with  he has been seeing the same doctor for thirty years and even if he did not have medical insurance he could just pay his doctor bills without a second thought further  even though  in  americans now have health coverage  that does not mean they have dental coverage the affordable care act  aca  made dental care a required benefit for children s insurance  but it did not extend this requirement to insurance for adults  therefore  many adults who buy non group insurance may still have no dental coverage  in   nearly  percent of people who bought health insurance on their own did not have dental coverage  and without dental coverage  many adults struggle to get the dental care they need trump has never woken up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain with a swollen face because of his inability to afford the dentist  he has never had to ask friends and family for money to have oral surgery  he has never searched his cabinets for old antibiotics  he has no fucking idea what that is like and wants to repeal the aca for millions of americans the only way to survive is to apply for government assistance  the vast majority of the  million people receive help are hardworking americans who just have too much month at the end of their money  they pay their taxes  work multiple jobs sometimes and just cannot stay afloat without help  and let me tell you  applying for it is the worst  donald trump has no idea what it is like to sit on pins and needles hoping the government deems you worthy of being able to purchase food  he has no idea what it feels like to go to bed hungry  and ironically  if he was ever put into a situation where he needed a hand up  he d be one of those  moochers  his party talks about all the time  you know the one  the person the gop claims doesn t pay taxes but  expects  a hand out  well  trump hasn t paid taxes in almost  years making him the ultimate moocher by now you have all heard about donald trump s visit to flint  michigan last month  trump wanted the people of that city to know that he was on their side  his visit to the city came almost a year after america found out that the state had been poisoning the mostly african american residents of the city for two years with lead contaminated water  trump  the guy who lives in penthouses and mansions has absolutely no idea what it is like to worry about drinking poisoned water  this is a very real struggle for not just the people of flint  but in every state across the country according to reports  the idea that he can relate to this struggle is as preposterous as his visit to flint  furthermore  trump is an anti regulation republican  so there is no chance in hell that he is going to prevent this from happening in other cities around the country if elected these are just five of the ways trump is nothing like us  but there are many more  trump also has no idea what it is like to run out of toothpaste or toilet paper and not have the money to buy more  he has no idea what it is like to look at his children and tell them that he cannot afford a   toy  he has no idea what it is like to not be able to get his children a pet because he cannot afford the vet bills  he has no idea what it is like to watch his children go off to war so that they can hopefully live through it and get a free education  he has no idea what it is like to go hungry  go without heat  go without shoes or any of the other things americans face every single day he is nothing like us and we must do everything we possibly can to keep him out of the white
