earlier this week  devin nunes finally recused himself from the house intel committee s probe on russian election tampering  putting mike conaway of texas in charge  rep  adam schiff  the top democrat on the panel  remains in place  schiff has been working tirelessly to ensure that nunes  decision to leak classified info  and to talk to agent cheeto before the rest of his committee  doesn t derail the house s investigation any more than it has to but some republicans are apparently unhappy with schiff still being there  one such republican is former house intel chairman mike rogers  who seems to think that if nunes had to recuse himself from the probe  then schiff should likewise recuse himself  his reasoning is almost as batty as mike conaway s reasoning that mexican performing artists are the same as russian hackers  representative adam schiff should consider recusing himself from the probe  for his part  schiff suggested to the media that he had seen information on russia trump campaign ties that was  the kind of evidence  that would be presented to a grand jury  adding that he had seen additional evidence  but not elaborating further  he went on to ask how the committee could continue doing its business when secret information is publicly discussed  even by innuendo  except schiff didn t go running to others with documents in hand  he simply explained how he interpreted what he had seen  without revealing what he had seen republicans seem to be incapable of making valid comparisons rogers has a serious problem with schiff because he believes that schiff politicized the committee s investigation  he couldn t be more wrong  it was nunes who politicized it when he took information directly to trump before presenting it to the rest of the committee rogers is right about one thing  the committee needs to get back on track as soon as possible  that won t happen without schiff  though  because he s been relentless in trying to keep the committee on track  rogers  call for him to recuse himself positively reeks of   no fair  we gave someone up so now you have to  featured image by mark wilson via getty images
