you would think that a businessman would understand math  not donald trump democratic congressional candidate jon ossoff narrowly missed an outright victory in georgia on tuesday as republicans poured money into the race  ossoff s anti trump campaign soared and nearly cruised to an easy win in a district that is considered a republican fortress in other words  ossoff should not have been able to even get close to winning  but donald trump s increasing unpopularity combined with his incompetence gave democrats a strategy to become competitive in even the most conservative areas after being upset in delaware and nearly losing in kansas  republicans had much to be worried about on tuesday as election results flowed in even trump recognized that the race in georgia represents a backlash against his administration and republican power in congress  which is why he attacked ossoff repeatedly on twitter it s a test of what republicans could expect in  when the midterm election rolls around instead of a republican wave  however  the current party that controls congress could be swept out of power by a democratic wave  paving the way for trump s impeachment and the reversal of the destructive policies he and his republican friends in congress have put in place so far in the end  ossoff did not secure the  percent of the vote needed to win  the election now heads to a runoff in june between ossoff and republican karen handel but that didn t stop trump from declaring that race a victory for republicans and taking credit for it despite major outside money  fake media support and eleven republican candidates  big  r  win with runoff in georgia  glad to be of help   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    failed in kansas and are now failing in georgia  great job karen handel  it is now hollywood vs  georgia on june    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    problem is that democrats did not  fail   ossoff captured  percent of the vote in a district that should have easily been won by republicans  handel only got  percent of the vote and ossoff got more votes than just about every republican on the ticket combined twitter users were more than happy to humiliate trump s math skills  realdonaldtrump dems didn t  fail  in georgia  the  super liberal  democrat  ossoff got more votes than every single republican by far   factsmatter pic twitter com   william legate   williamlegate  april    realdonaldtrump they did  but  sweetie republicans are failing in those districts to win by same margins as they did before you came along   erich mcelroy   erichmcelroy  april    realdonaldtrump he got   of the vote twice as much as handel   tony posnanski   tonyposnanski  april    realdonaldtrump by  failing  you mean how well ossoff did despite tons of dark money spending by the reps in rep territory  alright   anirvan ghosh   anirvanghosh  april    realdonaldtrump just for the record  ossoff won twice the number of popular votes as handel  that s called a  win    anirvan ghosh   anirvanghosh  april    realdonaldtrump you should ask ossoff how it feels to actually win the popular vote   mark pygas   markpygas  april    jordanuhl  realdonaldtrump just gotta love the fact that a reality tv star is whining about  hollywood  patricia zh    ljtost  april    mikepwilliams  realdonaldtrump i don t ever remember  barackobama repeatedly bashing every person that didn t vote for him  probably because he was a decent person  though  dana smith     april    realdonaldtrump are you kidding me  are you unable to comprehend basic math  dems have the most votes in ga  what is wrong with you       veevee  april    realdonaldtrump  fail   you keep using this word  i do not think it means what you think it means  pic twitter com   howdy doody   danhowdle  april    realdonaldtrump  ossoff got a bigger percentage of the vote than you did   kristina wong     mskristinawong  april    s time for republicans to face reality  donald trump is hurting their party and is the reason why they are heading for a major defeat in  featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
