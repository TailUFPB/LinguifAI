one of fox news  biggest and most successful news personalities is bringing the network down in a major way recently  the o reilly factor host bill o reilly was exposed for a massive amount of sexual harassment lawsuits that the network settled for him over the span of his career  as fox has already gained quite the reputation for its sexist culture and tendency to protect its people from sexual harassment allegations  this is damaging enough to the network s reputation   but it s looking like the network will also suffer a big financial hit so far   and this is just the beginning   as many as  advertisers have pulled ads from o reilly s show over word of the lawsuits  these advertisers include major brands such as mercedes benz  hyundai  bmw of north america  mitsubishi motors  lexus  constant contact  bayer  ainsworth pet nutrition  untuckit  allstate  esurance  t  rowe price  glaxosmithkline  sanofi  orkin  and wayfair  and of course  fox news is trying to sweep this under the rug and pretend that these ad dollars are going to be used elsewhere on fox  what else would you expect from the most dishonest cable news network this is really  really bad news for the network  o reilly was responsible for bringing in over   billion in advertisements from   alone  if advertisers are deciding to walk away from o reilly over these new revelations  this could really hurt fox news  bottom line fox news is already struggling to begin with  as the network has lost almost all credibility for defending and continuing to support donald trump  the network has been proven to be highly inaccurate  and trump has helped to make fox news a joke when it comes to trustworthy media  o reilly s recent scandal could be the final straw for the network  as it becomes even less popular than before featured image via ilya s  savenok getty images
