it might be hard to believe from the amount of praise she shells out for republican nominee donald trump  but believe it or not  conservative pundit ann coulter wasn t always a fan of the business mogul   until he showed america just how racist he truly was in a recent appearance on the off message podcast  coulter told politico s glenn thrush that she was upset the donald has softened  and repeatedly flip flipped  his position on immigration   a sign that he was giving into the pressure of the  amnesty  crowd that was taking control over his campaign during the podcast  coulter expressed great resentment toward trump s new campaign manager  kellyanne conway  who she is blaming for the gop nominee s recent shifts on some of his most offensive and controversial policies  just to show you just how much coulter loves trump for his racist  xenophobic policies  she once said that trump s proposal to ban all muslims from coming into the united states was the best birthday gift ever  in fact  coulter admitted that she hadn t even liked trump   she originally thought he was a  boorish vulgarian    until he came forward with his disgusting plans for immigration  coulter reminisced about the correspondence she used to have with trump s then campaign manager  corey lewandowski  i was worried  the first few weeks after he announced  and   i haven t told the other people this   i would email in a point or two now and then  and whatever  whenever i would email corey  whatever   stop re tweeting ugly photos of opponents  wives   or whatever it was  what the final point was  always   don t let him back down on immigration  and corey was getting a little exasperated with me and kept saying   he s not backing down   then he came out for the muslim ban on my birthday  dec    my best birthday gift ever  i finally emailed corey and said   ok  i think he s not backing down  but now that trump has been going soft on his plan to deport  million people  coulter is upset and being rather vocal that she thinks it s a  mistake   coulter must be devastated that her political soulmate is backing down on her  because at one point of the podcast  she said this  i worship him like the north koreans worship the  dear leader    yes  i would die for him  which totally makes sense  because coulter soon revealed that she and trump actually have a lot in common   they both lack empathy and will just say whatever the f ck they want  i didn t get the gene that makes me care about what other people think  i m much like trump that way  i don t really care  they re just words  you can listen to the full  bizarre interview below featured image via screenshot
