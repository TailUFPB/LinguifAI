according to senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr  r n c    michael flynn is not willing to cooperate with the committee s investigation into russian interference in american elections in an interview with capitol hill press on thursday  burr told reporters that flynn s attorneys  have not yet indicated their attentions  to comply with a subpoena  despite the fact that is only  a day or two left  before flynn will be forced to produce documents and testimony or be held in contempt  senator burr was careful to couch his words to maintain an impartial stance  but reporters present said that the senator was clearly upset by flynn s disregard for the investigation burr initially said that flynn wasn t going to comply with the subpoena  but walked that statement back in order to make it clear that there was still time for his lawyers to reach out to the committee if they chose to do so do the msm think i m dumb enough  accpt their interview rqusts only  see my words twisted spun  fit their  fakenews agenda   wastingtime  i love america     mflynnjr  may    himself has declined to comment on the investigation altogether  although his son  michael flynn jr  has been talking on twitter refusing to comply with this subpoena will all but disqualify flynn from the immunity he sought last month  when his lawyer went on twitter to beg multiple investigations to consider offering it to his client immunity from prosecution typically follows a clearly defined legal path  where the guilty party first meets with prosecutors and tells them everything he knows in a sealed session  which gives them time to consider making a deal  this is called a  proffer session  and flynn has shown no willingness to do it instead  it appears as though flynn and his attorneys expect the senate committee to blindly trust that flynn has something meaningful to say in exchange for immunity judging by burr s response  the senators aren t biting  and they re starting to lose their patience  photo by mario tama via getty images
