trump has been telling the whole world about how he ll make our economy boom  he s going to cut taxes  but not cut medicare or social security  he tells blue collar workers that he ll renegotiate all our trade agreements to bring their jobs back  he s going to balance the federal budget within seven years  he has something for everyone  but no plan to pay for any of it or does he trump s senior economic adviser  stephen moore  held a hush hush meeting with the vice president of the council for national policy  bill walton  in that meeting  moore revealed a lot of the ins and outs of the campaign s ideas for paying for his plan  and the whole thing smacks of far right  free market  trickle down  anti government conservatism unlike anything we ve seen before moore wants trump to eliminate the department of education  department of commerce  and department of energy  just to start  that will cost  oh  about   jobs or so  not to mention that  with the elimination of the department of commerce  we ll lose the u s  patent office  the u s  census bureau  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  and more  trump believes  however  that this is the source of a lot of crony capitalism and corporate welfare  so make it disappear they also want to get rid of the department of education  that  however  will cost us a uniform accreditation process for colleges and universities  along with everything having to do with grants and student loans  no biggie  everyone can just get private student loans from their own banks  right  right  even if they re the poorest of the poor  they d have to  seeing as how it s not likely congress will pass universal post secondary education anytime soon it s moore that s pushing trump to do something about the department of energy  including ending the energy subsidies  eliminating the entire department will probably cost us every national laboratory we have that deals with energy research and development  this includes the famous los alamos national laboratory  which was responsible for developing the atom bomb  they also work on nuclear research  cryogenics  and more  maybe they ll just hand these over to private companies with profit motives  he actually said  in that meeting  i mean  my god  why do we need an energy department  all the energy department has done in the last  years is make energy prices more expensive  or it was due  at least in part  to giving utilities to private enterprises with a profit motive  but hey  he can think what he wants  they can  of course  move these agencies and offices to other departments  and maybe consolidate some  but the savings from doing this won t be near what they likely think moore believes in sending things like job training  health care and other medical services  back to the states  the federal government would give the states block grants to administer this stuff  perhaps trump would give them yuuuuuuuuuuuuuge block grants to administer all of the above things that will disappear with department elimination  too and then they ll slowly go away as budgets get cut  states are notorious for finding ways around the strings attached to block grants  which allows them to divert that money to other things but these kinds of proposals aren t exactly new for republicans  what moore also wants trump to do is lift all  read  all  restrictions and regulations on mining  drilling and fracking  and here we have it  the answer to which energy subsidies would get cut  the ones going to renewables  because of course lifting the regulations on fossil fuel production would  in moore s view  create  to  million new jobs  those jobs would increase tax revenue  that  plus ending the subsidies to renewables so that fossil fuels no longer have competition  would bring a windfall of cash then trump can pay for the tax cuts he plans to give his rich buddies that is  of course  assuming that fossil fuel prices stay where they are  or rise  the energy companies have to see a profit in this plan  or they won t play ball  we can t stop the rest of the world from developing renewables and leaving us in the dust  and we can t stop opec from continuing to produce as much as they want to compete with us working as closely with a master businessman as moore is  he should know that falling demand means falling prices  the energy companies have already put some brakes on fracking here because of the glut of oil worldwide  it s not as profitable to frack right now as they want plus  no regulation at all  yeah  that ll work  you watch  it ll be great  we ll have the best market  companies will become safer and more environmentally conscious because of competition or so the free market capitalists  wet dreams say moore really hopes that trump will climb on board with all of this  after all  moore just wants to help his candidate  make america great again   and clearly  this will do it  it s foolproof featured image by alex wong getty images
