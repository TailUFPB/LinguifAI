earlier today  donald trump once again disgraced the united states by demonstrating his incompetence with empty threats to north korea   via his twitter account  showcasing his inability to handle a crisis  trump tweeted that he would meet with his military experts and could only say  we ll see  when he was asked about his plans to attack north korea further proving that no one in his administration takes him seriously  defense secretary james mattis was sent out to give a more powerful statement on north korea  outshining his own boss  threats  in a statement  mattis warned north korea that the united states military would certainly respond to any threat  mattis said  any threat to the united states or its territories  including guam  or our allies will be met with a massive military response  a response both effective and overwhelming  mattis also urged north korea to listen to the un security council  all members unanimously agreed on the threat north korea poses and they remain unanimous in their commitment to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula  we are not looking to the total annihilation of a country  namely north korea  but as i said we have many options to do so  of course  the reason mattis had to make this statement in the first place is because no one can believe a word that trump says  even eight months into his presidency  trump has managed to destroy every ounce of credibility he might have had  and many of the tasks he should be doing are now falling on the shoulders of his more capable administration members  no one takes him seriously  so he needs to send others to make statements for him you can watch mattis cover for his boss in the video below defense secretary james mattis   any threat to the united states   will be met with a massive military response  https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  september    image via drew angerer getty images
