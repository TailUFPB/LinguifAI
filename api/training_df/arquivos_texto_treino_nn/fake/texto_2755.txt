on tuesday  a hot mic at a house republican presser caught someone saying exactly what we were all thinking after house speaker paul ryan told press that he was kept in the dark about donald trump s muslim ban  someone was heard complaining that the press conference was a  waste of my f cking time  initially  it was rumored that ryan   who had just told press that he and other republicans were kept in the dark about trump s muslim ban until it was being implemented   had uttered the words  while he would have had every reason  mediaite quickly quelled the rumor before it spread  a nice contrast to what we see happen in conservative media  watching the video  ryan was well away from the microphones when the comment was tossed out  in all likelihood  this was either a reporter or a tech who was a little too close  and loud  to the network s mic the accusation was initially made by house minority leader nancy pelosi s deputy chief of staff drew hammill  because he is adult  he apologized for the error and everyone went on with their day   brendanbuck tells me that was not his boss  will take his word for it and i apologized   drew hammill   drewhammill  january    drewhammill thank you  appreciate it  he s not really an f bomb guy   brendan buck   brendanbuck  january    ryan might as well have said it was a waste of his time  because it was  today  we received confirmation that donald trump is completely shutting even his political allies out of the decision making process  we were briefed on the contents of it as it was being rolled out   ryan said   clearly  none of us want to see people with green cards get implicated in this  and that s not the goal here  what the president has asked us to focus on  something that we ve ran on  is we ve got to secure our border   he continued   we have a border security problem  that s what the physical barrier on the border is all about and we have security concerns given this age of terrorism  given the fact that we have drugs coming across our border  we have an opioid problem  there are lots of reasons why our focus is first and foremost is on border security   ryan said in other words  they ve been told to sit in the corner while daddy does the important stuff this press conference was a waste of time  the republican party  and congress as a whole  has been largely shut out of any major decisions in this country if trump even remotely has the power to just do it himself   and unfortunately  he intends to use the full power of the presidency to do the same thing to america that he does to his businesses whomever was caught complaining was  percent right  there was no need for anyone to be there or for republicans to pretend that they are even remotely important anymore in trump s america  thank you  anonymous hero  for pointing out exactly what is wrong with our country at the moment featured image via screengrab
