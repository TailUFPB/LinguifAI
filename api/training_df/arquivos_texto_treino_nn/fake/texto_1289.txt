as liberals are fighting over a picture posted by a self professed d list comedian and bill maher uttering the  n  word  republicans are waging a serious attack on the first amendment by attempting to silence our constitutional right to protest as you may recall  on january   millions of people took to the streets to protest the inauguration of donald trump  in washington  d c    protesters were arrested after anarchists clashed with the police anti trump chants were occasionally drowned out by the thuds of sound grenades and smoke bombs left behind was broken glass from the windows of cafes  restaurants and banks  declarations of resistance marked the walls and pavements   make racists afraid again   and  f ck trump  images of a limousine in flames later made it onto television screens and the front pages of news websites around the world source  al jazeerathe d c  courts decided to throw the book at the protesters   protesters and bystanders were initially charged with felony rioting  which carries a maximum sentence of  years and a    fine on april   though  the superior court of d c  doubled down and now  of those defendants are facing up to  years in prison  some of the defendants are journalists  who face up to  years  each  this  despite the fact that a lot of them seemed to have been swept up in the confusion and they had no warning to disperse or that tear gas and rubber bullets were coming their way for  protester olivia  alsip  the ever present weight of the charges has already taken a toll on her life   i m pretty shocked by the impact it s had on my personal life   she explains  it seems that innocent until proven guilty is a falsehood   all the way from the prosecution and police to the people who had previously supported me in my activism  it s hanging over my head the entire time  which makes it really challenging  it hinders your ability to plan your life  the bigger issue  of course  is the fact that the first amendment seems to be under attack from all angles  donald trump has been staging a war on the media  a man who body slammed a journalist was just elected to congress  some states are legalizing murdering protesters with your car while some of the protesters in d c  were undoubtedly involved in rioting  the penalties are draconian and it seems the courts have no interest in figuring out who the guilty parties really were  what this will accomplish for the right is fear  people will be reluctant to express their opinions because they could be thrown in prison  or in some states  run over by a car featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
