very little is more infuriating for women than to have our appearances policed  yet  police us people do  usually by criticizing what s in fashion and calling it too immodest  and crying that men can t stop staring and thus are sinning in their hearts  or saying that women over a certain age should not wear this or that  one of the latest incidents comes from alan sorrentino  of rhode island  who wrote a letter to editor for eastbayri saying women over  should not be wearing yoga pants in public yoga pants draw a lot of ire from the supposedly pious and the supposedly weak willed  sorrentino s specific targeting of women in yoga pants earned him a  yoga pants parade  through the street in front of his house  hundreds of people men and women participated while wearing yoga pants yes  there were men wearing yoga pants to stand in solidarity with women who are tired of being told what they can and cannot wear  and paraded with women in front of sorrentino s house  sorrentino got more than an eyeful of the  struggles with physicality  that he doesn t want to see anymore  to all yoga pant wearers  i struggle with my own physicality as i age  i don t want to struggle with yours  thanks  his problem is that  as women age  we lose our beauty and our bodies  which  to people like him  necessarily restrict what we can wear  it s like he thinks that if we re not young and beautiful  we should hide ourselves in some way  oh wait  that s exactly what he thinks   like the mini skirt  yoga pants can be adorable on children and young women who have the benefit of nature s blessing of youth  however  on mature  adult women there is something bizarre and disturbing about the appearance they make in public  maybe it s the unforgiving perspective they provide  inappropriate for general consumption  tmi  or the spector  of someone coping poorly with their weight or advancing age that makes yoga pants so weird in public a nice pair of tailored slacks  jeans  or anything else would be better than those stinky  tacky  ridiculous looking yoga pants  they do nothing to compliment a women over  years old  in fact  the look is bad  do yourself a favor  grow up and stop wearing them in public   how disgusting  if someone is dressed or presenting an appearance we don t want to see  we can  you know  just look somewhere else  or better yet  we can accept that there are things in this world that we personally would rather not see  truly mature people  one of whom sorrentino clearly isn t  recognize that it s not our place to tell other people what they can and cannot wear based on our personal comfort sorrentino is now claiming he wrote the letter as a joke  and the paper is defending its decision to publish it by explaining that they publish all opinions as long as they aren t attacking a person or a group  in this case  mr  sorrentino is not attacking any individual nor specific group  it s safe to assume that his comments target a large portion of america s female population  and that group obviously has ample firepower to respond to mr  sorrentino and his opinions  telling women over  how they can and cannot dress isn t attacking women  okay then  that s systemic sexism  though  here s hoping the yoga pants parade got sorrentino s attention  and he rethinks his position  joke or not  it was inappropriate at best here s a short video from the parade the  yogapantsparade is underway   pic twitter com vitoslslaa  bianca buono     october    image via screen capture from embedded video
