who doesn t love leslie knope  she even wormed her way into the heart of that staunch libertarian ron swanson parks and recreation has a beloved place in the hearts of many in america  in fact   especially millennials  and no character is more beloved than amy poehler s leslie knope for many fans  it s almost impossible to imagine a reaction to this electoral disaster from the almost annoyingly bubbly knope   her optimism doesn t seem to have much of a place here  however  while perfectly maintaining the voice of the character  she shows that s not the case  you can read my favorite passage below like most people  i deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief  denial  anger  bargaining  depression  and acceptance  my denial over the election results was intense  my anger was  in ron s words   significant   my bargaining was short  but creative  i offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for   more votes in milwaukee  to any demon who cared to accept   tom told me it was a terrible deal  but i didn t care  in that moment   my depression i have already mentioned  which brings us to acceptance  and here s what i stand on that no  i do not accept it i acknowledge that donald trump is the president  i understand  intellectually  that he won the election  but i do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred swirled slop pile that he lives in  i reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism  xenophobia  misogyny  and crypto fascism  i do not accept that  i reject that  i fight that  today  and tomorrow  and every day until the next election  i reject and fight that story  i work hard and i form ideas and i meet and talk to other people who feel like me  and we sit down and drink hot chocolate  i have plenty  and we plan  we plan like mofos  we figure out how to fight back  and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad  and we will be kind to each other  and supportive of each other s ideas  and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate and let me say something to the young girls who are reading this  hi  girls  on behalf of the grown ups of america who care about you and your futures  i am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up  we elected a giant farting t  rex who does not like you  or care about you  or think about you  unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy t  rex eyes  or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him  or would have  if his daddy had loved him    sorry  that was a low blow    actually  not sorry  i m pissed  and i m on a roll  so zip it  super ego   our president elect is everything you should abhor  and fear  in a male role model  he has spent his life telling you  and girls and women like you  that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects  he has demeaned you  and belittled you  and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard  it is your job  and the job of girls and women like you  to bust out i highly encourage you to read the rest of it as well   leslie is exactly right  it s time for us to fight harder than ever
