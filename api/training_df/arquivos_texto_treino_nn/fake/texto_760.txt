unlike the united states  germany has both a president and a chancellor  the president is nothing more than a figurehead  of course  it is chancellor angela merkel actually runs the nation  at any rate  germany s current president  frank walter steinmeier  has come out on television to tell everyone just how he feels about donald trump speaking to a german television host  president steinmeier says that he is  irritated  by trump  of course  since germany is a staunch ally of the united states  he was careful in his wording and quick to recognize the relationship between the two nations  especially during the crucial rebuilding of europe in the post world war ii era  steinmerier says  our economic development would not have happened without the marshall plan  in this respect  i advise us not to throw everything overboard  even though i admit that i am irritated about a lot of things  he went on to essentially say he knows that most americans are just as horrified by trump as he is  not all of america has forgotten the transatlantic relationship  and therefore i believe that within american politics  there will be corrections made to what we are now seeing  of course  this is how you rebuke someone without even mentioning their name  further  these remarks should come as no surprise  since trump and german chanecellor angela merkel have long had a frosty relationship  like decent people everywhere  she was appalled by trump s campaign trail behavior  and things have only gotten worse since trump took office  when merkel visited the white house  trump actually gave her a bill for nato  apparently in an attempt to keep his promise that he d make our allies pay up before offering  our protection  he also had the audacity to joke about merkel being wiretapped  and then of course  there was the fact that trump was way out of his league at the g   the g  and nato summits all in all  the world cannot wait to be rid of trump  it s okay   neither can we featured image via justin sullivan getty images
