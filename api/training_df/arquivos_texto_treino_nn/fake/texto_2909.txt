just as his press secretary  sean spicer  made a complete idiot of himself stroking trump s ego and blasting a flabbergasted white house press corps  trump himself made a complete idiot of himself addressing the cia today  except in trump s case  he wasn t just dumb  he was offensive  and former cia chief john brennan had something to say about it standing in front of the cia s memorial wall  trump whined and cried that the media was lying about his numbers at the inauguration  claiming that there had to have been at least   million people there  he devoted just a couple of minutes of the entire speech to actually talking to the cia  in response to that  brennan said  according to his former chief of staff  nick shapiro  former cia director brennan is deeply saddened and angered at donald trump s despicable display of self aggrandizement in front of cia s memorial wall of agency heroes  brennan says that trump should be ashamed of himself  brennan wasn t alone in this  another former cia official said he was embarrassed by trump s  free wheeling  narcissistic diatribe   yet another said   not quite a  this is hallowed ground moment  former cia director mike hayden  who is republican but stood against trump  actually took a hell of a dig at him for it  i was heartened that the president gave a speech at cia  it would have been even better if more of it had been about cia   a dnc senior adviser  zac petkanas  issued a blistering statement  too  after he finished ranting about crowd sizes on the national mall  i hope president trump sat down for an interview with the cia to help with their investigation into his team s possible collusion with the kremlin to win the election  next  he can sit down with the fbi who have sought warrants to monitor his team for the same reason  for his part  trump had to drop this piece of insanity into his speech  and i know maybe sometimes you haven t gotten the backing that you ve wanted  and you re going to get so much backing  maybe you re going to say  please don t give us so much backing  lords  gods and minor deities  really  that s reminiscent of when he said we were going to start winning so much that we d get tired of it at least he didn t ask them to raise their hands if they voted for him we all know trump has no shame  he loves to lie and he s got his staff lying their asses off for him  too  but this disrespectful display is over the top for a man occupying the highest office in the u s worse  he was greeted by cheering cia officers when he arrived there  and he proceeded to talk all about himself  that wall  with  stars representing agents who have died in the line of duty  is a sacred place  trump desecrated it with his childish egotism and accusations of lies  most presidents who speak there choose their words and tones very carefully out of respect for fallen agents and the families they ve left behind but not trump  trump has to make everything all about himself  he deserves to be blasted for it photo of john brennan by evy mages getty images  photo of donald trump by olivier doulier   pool getty images
