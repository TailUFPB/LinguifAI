a e decided to just scrap its previously upcoming documentary series  escaping the kkk    once called the more friendly  generation kkk  before the avalanche of complaints   after learning that the klansmen and women in question were paid to take part in it in a statement released saturday  the network announced the cancellation   the final leg of a shameful journey of backtracking that has accompanied the show  which claimed to offer an  unprecedented  look inside the ku klux klan   comes following a discovery that the producers made  nominal   cash payments  to participants  our goal with this series has always been to expose and combat racism and hatred in all its forms   the network said   however  a e learned last night from the third party producers who made the documentary that cash payments which we currently understand to be nominal were made in the field to some participants in order to facilitate access  apparently  a e could handle the shame of a docuseries attempting to normalize the klan  but not actually paying them  the network says it stands by the show s content  which allegedly showed the struggles with the internal families  of the klan  but the cash payments violated company policy  while we stand behind the intent of the series and the seriousness of the content  these payments are a direct violation of a e s policies and practices for a documentary  we had previously provided assurances to the public and to our core partners including the anti defamation league and color of change that no payment was made to hate group members  and we believed that to be the case at the time  we have now decided not to move forward with airing this project  network vice president robert sharenow lashed out at america for making the network s awesome kkk series go away  reminding everyone that it doesn t erase the hate and throwing out the obligatory  we don t endorse the hate group we were promoting by giving them a platform  message  a e takes the authenticity of its documentary programming and the subject of racism  hatred and violence very seriously  just because this particular show goes away  the issues of hate in america do not  we will still seek to fight hate in america through on air programming including town halls and documentary programs produced in partnership with civil rights organizations  as well as continue to work with the civil rights community to facilitate a deeper dialogue on ending hate through comprehensive educational and outreach campaigns  this isn t the first time a e has given voice to hateful and deranged people  the network previously played host to duck dynasty  whose patriarch regularly spouts hate speech masked by his religion  and numerous shows that featured child molesters and alleged child molesters  while they  have backpedaled a lot   first changing the name of the show in response to backlash and ultimately canceling it for the cash payments   it is probably unwise to cut them any slack here based on their history the show was set to premier on january   just in time to accompany the beginning of donald trump s presidency featured image via screengrab
