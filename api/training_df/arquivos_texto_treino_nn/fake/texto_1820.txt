the trump administration is working as hard as it can to fulfill its promise of cracking down on illegal immigration  and part of that promise was  more or less  to be as evil as possible so they won t even want to come over here  now  jeff sessions is starting to work on putting this into practice  including pushing for more severe prosecutions and punishments  even for non violent immigrants but it s not what he s doing that s so horrid  it s horrid  but not nearly as much so as what he planned to called them in a speech to border patrol agents in nogales  his planned remarks included this vile portion  it is here  on this sliver of land  where we first take our stand against this filth this is a new era  this is the trump era  now  that supposedly was referring only to criminal organizations like gangs and cartels  however  many of the people who cross the border illegally are doing so to escape those very organizations   not to expand them into the u s he didn t actually say this in his speech in nogales  but it was in his prepared remarks  the fact that it was even there shows exactly how he sees undocumented immigrants  they re chattel  they re dirty  disgusting animals  and they re any number of things other than human beings to him undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than citizens  people like to point to the fact that they make up a large share of inmates in federal prisons  but federal prisons are a small part of the total prison system in the u s  ice s recent numbers aren t especially telling  either since their current focus is immigrants with criminal convictions  which is why they re stalking courthouses  trump once said that undocumented immigrants were rapists and murderers   and some  i assume  are good people   sessions is building upon that view of undocumented immigrants as mostly criminals  and no amount of   we re talking about criminal organizations  is going to change that until this administration changes its attitude featured image by michael b  thomas via getty images
