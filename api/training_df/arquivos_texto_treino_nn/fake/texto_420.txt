donald trump practically does something to criticize the media as being  fake news  on an almost daily basis  but two major news networks have just turned the tables and put him on blast in a major way the white house is currently up in arms over a recent decision by cnn and msnbc  who decided not to air trump s insanely dishonest north dakota speech from earlier today  trump was supposed to address tax reform in his speech  but there was a major problem with what he was saying   not a word of it was true  in response to this fact free speech  cnn and msnbc decided that it was irresponsible to air the speech and decided to spare americans the misinformation and nonsense once the trump administration found out about this move by the press  the white house practically threw a hissy fit  special assistant to the president and assistant white house communications director steven chueng tweeted instead of insulting their viewers with trump s lies  msnbc s nicole wallace reported on important  truthful topics such as daca and russia  cnn s jake tapper focused on hurricane irma  russia  and the debt ceiling while trump spewed his usual nonsense this was a major f ck you to the trump administration and sends a strong message that the dishonest narrative that his administration continues to put out to the american people will not be tolerated  while people aren t likely going to react so strongly to a topic as dry as tax reform  having two major networks refusing to air his speech is a big deal  trump desperately wants and needs that coverage  and is obviously pissed that all eyes were not on him  if more cable news networks break from trump  his already failing presidency will be in even more danger featured image is a screenshot
