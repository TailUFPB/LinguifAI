as election day continues to get closer on the calendar  some conservatives are already threatening to commit acts of violence if hillary clinton beats donald trump in fact  conservatives  including trump  have been laying the groundwork for months now to invalidate the election results in the event donald trump loses the republican nominee went to pennsylvania in august and declared that the only way he can possibly lose pennsylvania is if hillary clinton cheats to win the state  ever since then  trump s campaign and the republicans that support him have been claiming that clinton will somehow steak the election via election fraud  which suggests trump and his conservative backers will refuse to gracefully accept defeat on election day and could go so far as to make threats and commit acts of violence in order to prevent hillary from taking over as commander in chief and such a move by conservatives would not only be unprecedented in the entire history of our nation  it would also be treason historian dr  ronald feinman explained in an article published by history news network that in all of our history  no losing presidential candidate has ever not accepted defeat in the wake of losing an election  there has never been a threat of a losing candidate refusing to accept the victory of his opponent  even in the midst of an oncoming civil war  or in the midst of the great depression  or during the tensions of the cold war years   feinman wrote there is absolutely no excuse or justification for even a perceived possibility that donald trump might cause a major threat to civil order by encouraging his supporters to refuse to accept his defeat  yet  we have some republicans  including kentucky governor matt bevin seemingly setting the stage for possible civil disobedience and even violence based on the argument that bill and hillary clinton are totally corrupt  and that no victory by hillary clinton would be valid  it is truly terrifying to think of the possible threat to the new president and vice president by crazed supporters who use trump s vehement opposition and potential rejection of the results as an excuse for bloodshed and violence  including a possible threat to the health  safety  and lives of hillary clinton and tim kaine during the values voter summit last month  bevin called for bloody rebellion if hillary clinton wins in november  somebody asked me yesterday  i did an interview and they said   do you think it s possible  if hillary clinton were to win the election  do you think it s possible that we ll be able to survive  that we would ever be able to recover as a nation  and while there are people who have stood on this stage and said we would not  i would beg to differ  but i will tell you this  i do think it would be possible  but at what price  at what price  the roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what  the blood  of who  the tyrants to be sure  but who else  the patriots  whose blood will be shed  it may be that of those in this room  it might be that of our children and grandchildren  i have nine children  it breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something  to reclaim something  that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away  donald trump has also suggested that  second amendment people  could  do something  to stop hillary clinton this suggests that trump and conservatives are planning to contest any election result that is not in their favor and are planning to cause chaos and commit violence if they don t get their way  this should be seen as a treasonable act  were it to occur  requiring the arrest  trial and incarceration of any trump supporters  including the candidate himself  who represent a threat to constitutional order and american democracy   feinman continued   donald trump would go down in history ever worse than his reputation has already been sullied by his actions and statements promoting division and chaos in america  and undermining its ability to protect national security  being a  sore loser  who advocates or endorses violence and bloodshed would put him into a class with people such as benedict arnold and aaron burr as traitors to the nation  indeed  trump and conservatives would be undermining our democracy and our tradition of peaceful transfers of political power which is why americans must defeat donald trump by a landslide on november  in order to send a clear message to trump and conservatives that their agenda is rejected and their behavior is totally unacceptable featured image  flickr
