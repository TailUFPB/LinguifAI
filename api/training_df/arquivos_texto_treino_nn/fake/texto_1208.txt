donald trump s bigoted attack against london s mayor just backfired spectacularly the day after london was attacked by a terrorists  trump launched an attack on the city s mayor by taking his words out of context and making it sound like he s a terrorist sympathizer just because of his name at least  dead and  wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is  no reason to be alarmed   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    excuse by london mayor sadiq khan who had to think fast on his  no reason to be alarmed  statement  msm is working hard to sell it   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    took a lot of criticism for his unsavory attacks on the mayor in the wake of the terrorist attack  and now conservatives in london just experienced the consequences in a snap parliamentary election held on thursday  uk voters booted conservatives and the extreme right wing out of power  making it impossible for prime minister theresa may to create a majority government  trump s remarks reportedly were partly to blame for the stunning defeat hearing from a labour friend that donald s nasty attacks on the mayor of london hurt the tories in the closing days   simon rosenberg   simonwdc  june    was also a major reason why conservatives lost the vote as young brits flocked to ballot box to correct an error made last year when voters approved of withdrawing the united kingdom from the european union based on bigotry and fear of muslims  not only did progressive labour leader jeromy corbyn win the youth vote by a landslide  more people voted in this election than they did during the brexit vote in may   just   of britons   voted in nov    just   of americans   votedon thursday    https   t co   jeff stein   jsteinvox  june      miliband won the youth vote by  points  in   clinton won it by  points tonight s exit poll  corbyn won it by  points  jeff stein   jsteinvox  june    may   just   of britons   voted in nov    just   of americans   votedon thursday    https   t co   jeff stein   jsteinvox  june    is a major victory that should scare the hell out of republicans here in america  if the same percentage of americans  especially american youths  vote in the  election  they are in serious trouble of losing the majority they currently have in congress  and that spells doom for trump as well  he will definitely be impeached if democrats control congress  and if he somehow survived until the  election  the trend away from right wing extremism could make him a one term loser let s hope what happened in the uk on thursday crosses the pond and bites trump and the republican party on the ass featured image  andrew harrer pool getty images
