we all know that president donald trump has wanted to blow up the  disaster  that is obamacare for months now  however  his latest vision of bringing better healthcare to the people of america will actually stop billions of dollars in payments to health insurance companies that serve the poorest enrollees in the affordable care act if the president stops these payments  the entire health insurance system will be thrown into complete chaos  resulting in higher prices and fewer choices  if any  for consumers  insurance companies would most likely increase the premiums of people using exchanges such as healthcare gov and covered california  or stop selling to them altogether  without trump s payments  this aspect of healthcare will simply fall apart under his watch the main issue behind all of this are cost sharing reduction  csr  payments  reimbursements to health insurance companies made in order to reduce out of pocket costs such as deductibles and copayments for low income customers  the house of republicans filed a lawsuit in   which is still pending  against the obama administration questioning the legality of these payments  according to one white house official  the trump administration has agreed to make the csr payment for the month of may  but has made no commitment after that  as donald trump himself said about the healthcare system in january during a pre inauguration speech  the easiest thing would be to let it implode in   and believe me  we d get pretty much whatever we wanted  in trump s unhinged mind  ending what he has referred to as these  bailout payments  would force democrats to negotiate repealing the affordable care act  however  they don t seem too keen on doing so  nor do the majority of the american people  with  percent stating that they don t approve of negotiations that disrupt insurance markets according to a survey conducted last month by the henry j  kaiser family foundation  three quarters of those surveyed also believe the aca should be kept running and two thirds  including a majority of republicans  believe that the repercussions of any further problems stemming from changes to healthcare in the usa sit squarely on president trump s shoulders still  the president continues to ignore any advice given to him and remains in favor of cutting the payments  to be eligible for the cost reduction  enrollees in exchanges can earn up to  percent of the federal poverty level  which equals    per person  with the csr payments being made by the government  deductibles of thousands of dollars are reduced to just hundreds for the consumer  a subsidy that has been received by seven million people between november     and january  this year  equating to  percent of exchange enrollees without the trump administration making these csr payments  insurers would need to raise premiums by an average of  percent on top of any other price increases next year featured image via mark wilson getty images
