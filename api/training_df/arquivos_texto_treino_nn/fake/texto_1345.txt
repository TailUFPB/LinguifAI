the white house is finally wising up and realizing that america s current president is a toddler  and donald trump literally cannot be left alone for a moment because he might further incriminate himself or cause another pr disaster many people have remarked that while trump s first overseas trip has been filled with several embarrassing moments and blunders  his activity on twitter has been uncharacteristically calm  there s a reason for that  and it might become a more permanent thing in the future according to the wall street journal  trump s twitter account may be going under a sort of lockdown that could be implemented long term  this includes a team of lawyers whose sole task is to vet trump s twitter activity to make sure he doesn t make himself or his administration look bad  seriously  how sad is it that a potus has so little self control that he needs a team of lawyers to monitor his social media activity   this is what the wsj reported one major change under consideration would vet the president s social media posts through a team of lawyers  who would decide if any needed to be adjusted or curtailed  the idea  said one of mr  trump s advisers  is to create a system so that tweets  don t go from the president s mind out to the universe  in its report  the wsj gave some cringeworthy examples of how trump s tweets have gone astray  such as the time he accused former president barack obama of  wiretapping  him  and the time he implied that his conversations with former fbi director james comey were taped former campaign aide barry bennett doubts that this plan will work  as he said  i would be shocked if he would agree to that  when told about trump s proposed twitter surveillance  however  that s not all the lawyers will be sought out for  it s being reported that trump will also meet with attorneys to  help deal with the legal ramifications of the russia investigation   lord knows trump needs all the help he can get featured image via pool   getty images
