at a rally in toledo  ohio  trump made his most frightening statement of this election cycle yet  after comparing his tax plan to hillary s  he boldly proclaimed  and just thinking to myself right now  we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump  right  what are we even having it for  what are we having it for her policies are so bad  boy  do we have a big difference   we should just cancel the election and install him as what  president  we all know he won t stay president for very long if we do that  he wants to be installed as the first king of the united states  even if he were democratically elected in twelve days  he d probably try to make this the last election this country ever sees anybody who doesn t see that after what he just said is both blind and foolish oh wait  perhaps he was just joking  just being funny  it s a very dangerous and inappropriate joke to make on the campaign trail  particularly for someone who has long since begun displaying fascist tendencies trump has fallen well behind hillary across national polls  in battleground states  and even in a few deep red states like arizona  utah  texas and georgia  they re in play for the first time in forever  trump s only hope may well be to simply be installed as the king  rather than elected to the white house by the people we have people like former congressman joe walsh calling for armed rebellion if trump loses  we have people like rep  jason chaffetz promising years of investigations into hillary if she s elected  we have trump himself calling for his supporters to intimidate voters at the polls in the name of ensuring that nobody votes who isn t legally allowed to  and claiming that there s already widespread voter fraud in texas he s incited his crowds toward violence  and he s undermining our democracy with his cries of unfairness  election stealing  and rigging now he says   we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump   that s the worst thing he can say as a presidential candidate in a democratic society  the worst  featured image by maddie mcgarvey via getty images
