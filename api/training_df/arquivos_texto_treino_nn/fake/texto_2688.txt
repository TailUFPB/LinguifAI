tomi lahren appeared on real time with bill maher on friday night and got totally owned for spewing her racist bullshit bill maher wondered if trump would have been elected president had he been black instead of white  what do you think if trump was black   maher asked his panel  maher described a scenario where trump is black and has had three wives and brags about grabbing women  by the p ssy   would he still have been elected michael eric dyson s response was that black trump would not even be running for president because he would be in prison indeed  black people end up in prison for doing a lot of the same shit white people usually get away with  that s why black people make up a larger portion of the prison population no black person would have been elected president by acting like trump lahren responded that it wouldn t have bothered her at all if trump were a black man  which we all know is a complete lie  i don t think it would matter   she said  drawing shock and outrage from the audience because even they knew lahren was lying maher asked lahren about the fact that over  percent of republicans believe that discrimination against white people is as bad as discrimination against black people lahren tried to side step the question but maher repeated it again  lahren then teeter tottered in her answer  saying that there s an  element  of this that is true but appeared to admit that republicans are wrong to make that claim that s when republican strategies rick wilson spoke up and absolutely nailed lahren  since i m a conservative and not a trump person  let me say this   wilson said   that s absurd  that s f cking crazy  here s the video via vidme later on  lahren blamed president obama for the loss of coal mining jobs in this country  as we all know  president obama sought to reduce and prevent the effects of climate change by issuing rules stopping the coal industry from polluting  but lahren had the gall to defend republicans for recently repealing those rules  so once again  the coal industry will be able to dump waste in waterways maher argued that these coal miners could be trained to do other kinds of jobs  such as renewable energy jobs that are safer for workers and better for the environment  lahren treated the coal miners like they are incapable of learning to do something new  as if they were all marked to be coal miners at birth once again  rick wilson shut her down  there s a kind of hazy nostalgia with trump s plan   we re going to have ironworks and shipyards and coal miners   wilson said   these are things   we might as well get our buggy whip industry back together again  it s this retrospective  fake past that doesn t exist anymore  and  god bless them  they work their asses off  and you know what  natural gas took their jobs  not barack obama  here s that video via vidme tomi lahren just could not hack it and it was obvious to everyone who watched the show featured image via screenshot
