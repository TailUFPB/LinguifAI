it s a job killer  it s a small business killer  it will eventually kill america and america s working class  so a rule that obama put in place via executive order  which expands overtime pay for salaried workers  must go  at least that s how pro rich  trickle down obsessed republicans see it  and now they have reason to cheer   a federal judge in texas has blocked that rule  it would have extended overtime pay to millions of american workers there s a problem  though  a glaring one that igor volsky pointed out on twitter  the very people that the gop claims to represent  particularly now that trump is president  are the ones who will be hurt the worst by blocking this rule  it raised the mandatory overtime threshold from    to    they ve also forgotten that they re far wealthier than the millions of people who would have benefited from this rule  here are just three examples paul ryan s net worth      s cheering that   wisconsinites earning less than    won t get paid for working overtime https   t co   igorvolsky   igorvolsky  november    cruz s net worth       s cheering that    texans earning less than    now won t get paid for working overtime https   t co   igorvolsky   igorvolsky  november    s net worth       s cheering that   arizonians earning less than    won t get paid for working overtime https   t co   igorvolsky   igorvolsky  november     judge amos mazzant said the rule actually violated the overtime stipulations of the fair labor standards act because it applied a salary only test to overtime pay instead of the current classifications which are based on job position however  businesses often use that part of the flsa to justify paying as many employees as possible a pittance  they either wrongly classify many employees as exempt when they shouldn t be under the law  or they change job titles to things like  manager  to justify making them exempt  then they continue to pay a pittance and treat them like hourly employees  all of this is illegal it s easy for republicans to say that blocking the overtime rule will help these hardworking americans keep their jobs  they never think about the fact that people don t have jobs because they think it ll be fun or because they re bored  people have jobs because they have to work to live and it s time republicans stop pretending that it s perfectly okay for workers to be unable to make ends meet despite working insane hours or multiple jobs  because hey  at least they have a job champions of the working class  hardly  it s more important to continue letting business run amok and claim that they re reining in obama s supposedly extreme use of executive power  this is same ol   same ol  from the gop  the working class voters that voted republican over their economic situations are the ones who will be hurt worst featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
