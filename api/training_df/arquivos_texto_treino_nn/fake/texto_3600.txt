in a direct assault on the free press  one of donald trump s top advisers literally called for putting the editor of the new york times in jail for publishing trump s tax returns as you may recall  the new york times came into possession of trump s  tax return that showed he wrote off a   million business loss that may have allowed him to not not any federal income taxes for two decades trump notoriously refused to release his tax returns throughout the entire campaign so it was only a matter of time before a media platform got hold of them and published them for everyone to see  after all  it s the duty of the free press to get information to the people  and most americans wanted trump to release his tax documents baquet and washington post legend bob woodward both said they would risk jail by publishing trump s taxes if they ever got possession of them not publishing trump s tax returns would have been a disservice to the american people and would have basically been a cover up on trump s behalf but corey lewandowski says that not only should the new york times have buried the story  executive editor dean baquet should be put behind bars for doing his job during a harvard university conference on thursday  lewandowski attacked the media  accused the new york times of committing a felony and said baquet should be jailed  thus signaling that trump and his team intend to violate the first amendment at will when he assumes power in january  we had one of the top people at the new york times come to harvard university and say   i m willing to go to jail to get a copy of donald trump s taxes so i can publish them   lewandowski said  dean baquet came here and offered to go to jail  you re telling me  he s willing to commit a felony on a private citizen to post his taxes  and there isn t enough scrutiny on the trump campaign and his business dealings and his taxes  it s egregious  he should be in jail  so one of trump s top minions literally wants to jail journalists for doing their job  especially if they publish stories that trump does not like  we re talking about publishing the facts here when the new york times criticized hillary clinton you didn t hear trump call for jailing journalists then  and that because he s okay with using the media to attack his opponents  he only wants to silence journalists when they publish negative stories about him  that s what dictators do  and that is exactly what trump wants to be featured image  drew angerer getty images
