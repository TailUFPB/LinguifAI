for the years since the debate over the affordable care act began  anti government republicans  is there another kind   have been bitching about the individual mandate that required people to buy insurance now it s their turn to come up with an alternative  and while theirs will cover fewer people  their solution is to force everyone to buy it  regardless of whether they can afford the barely subsidized coverage the addition  which was tacked onto the republican healthcare bill on monday  is somewhat different from the individual mandate in the affordable care act  which says that there would be a penalty for people who lack coverage for more than  days  in the gop bill  it s even worse  people would be barred from coverage at all for six months if they have a  day gap republicans added this provision after economists and health policy experts convinced them that it would be unsustainable to not force people to purchase insurance health policy experts across the political spectrum had warned that the initial senate bill s failure to include some penalty for going uninsured could cause a  death spiral  in which people go without health insurance while healthy and only buy it when they become sick  in that scenario  insurance premiums shoot up for everyone as insurance markets become flooded with customers who disproportionately require expensive treatments source  nbc newsthe main difference between this and the affordable care act  though  is that the cost of premiums are going to be much higher  according to the congressional budget office   million americans stand to lose their healthcare coverage if the gop bill becomes law by and large  republicans want to do away with the medicaid expansion  which allowed poorer people access to insurance  often without paying anything  everyone who makes under    a year receives subsidies to help pay for insurance under the affordable care act  instead with trumpcare  they want to offer those people a block grant  which would severely restrict medical spending  instead of subsidies  there will be tax credits some who aren t receiving medicaid or medicare might see more affordable premiums  but that s only because the coverage will be so much less republicans have now chosen to take the most controversial portion of the affordable care act and make it absolutely draconian  if you happen to be one of the  million who loses insurance  good luck getting it back featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
