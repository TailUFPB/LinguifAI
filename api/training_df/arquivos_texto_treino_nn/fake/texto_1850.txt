trump s war on  leakers  who make him look bad by exposing his lies is about to escalate  on saturday  a cnn reporter managed to snap a few pictures of trump playing golf for the  time as president  despite efforts by his staff to stop it  no doubt  the reporter will face recriminations from the trump team for doing his job this is the state our nation has been reduced to  a president so committed to vacations in the face of dismal approval ratings that he locks his press pool up to avoid getting caught doing what he knows looks really  really bad  when they report on it  they get attacked president trump playing a round of golf saturday at his club in west palm beach pic twitter com   kevin liptak   kevinliptakcnn  april    photo is blurry and obscured because trump did not want to be photographed and took all steps to avoid it  according to the press pool  reporters trailing trump were held in a library while trump golfed outside  cnn reporter ken tuohey managed to get a few shots anyways potus back at trump international golf course  pool report pic twitter com   eric lipton   ericliptonnyt  april    probably considered themselves lucky  on other occasions  trump s staff has gone to absurd lengths to prevent them from getting any pictures of trump while he s golfing  at one point  they began taping garbage bags over windows in the rooms reporters were held so they couldn t see outside  it s not entirely clear why reporters didn t just tear them down aside from undeserved politeness towards the president trump s press corps has been placed in a basement suite at jupiter golf club  black plastic over windows to give trump privacy as he golfs  pic twitter com   jennifer jacobs   jenniferjjacobs  february    has also repeatedly lied about golfing  several weeks in a row  trump claimed he was in serious  meetings  only to later be photographed golfing  in a baffling move that makes one wonder if he wants to be caught  trump apparently wears the exact same outfit every time he golfs  his red ball cap  white polo shirt and golf gloves serve as a blatant tell while he tries to lie no details from  whitehouse on today s  potus  meetings   attire and mode of transport suggest more leisurely pursuits at his golf course  pic twitter com   steve herman     march    most disturbing part in all of this is just how stubborn trump appears to be on this front  he just can t stop golfing  each time he does  he opens himself up to relentless criticism  it s his  vacation in  weeks  he s spent   million in travel expenses  he s golfing while his own white house implodes  but rather than just  say  skip a weekend of golf  he keeps going back that s a particularly disturbing pathology in a man who wants us to believe he s an effective president featured image via twitter
