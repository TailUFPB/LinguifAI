the overwhelming response to her temper tantrum was so humiliating that sarah palin removed the outrageous tweet just after midnight on wednesday morning  palin apparently learned that former san francisco quarterback colin kaepernick donated money to meals on wheels palin has relentlessly targeted kaepernick because he exercised his freedom to kneel during the national anthem in protest of police brutality against people of color kaepernick is currently a free agent and will likely find a new team before the next nfl season begins  but that didn t stop palin from gloating about his current status in response to donald trump s draconian budget that slashes funding for meals on wheels  a program that helps millions of senior citizens get a meal and a well being check every day from a volunteer  kaepernick donated    to the organization for some reason  palin has a problem with this and she threw a mini hissy fit on twitter complete with a link to a story on her own website palin soon deleted the offensive tweet and we ll get to the reason why shortly  however  a screenshot was obtained by a twitter user since she deleted her tweet  here s the screengrab where she mocks kaepernick for donating to meals on wheels  pic twitter com   rey  azure  mcsriff   aguyuno  march    you can see  palin mocked kaepernick for currently not having a job  even though there are still quite a few months before the next nfl season begins and free agency is part of the game palin linked to story on her website that called kaepernick s donation a purely  political stunt  you know  because palin doesn t believe kaepernick is capable of such a generous gesture out of the kindness of his heart the article has also been removed and that s because palin was buried under such an avalanche of humiliation that she was forced to do so in particular  twitter users pointed out that palin herself does not have a job  she s a mere grifter who quit her previous job as governor of alaska because it was easier to swindle money out of her gullible fans imagine being so racist you get mad a black athlete for donating to meals on wheels https   t co   adam h  johnson   adamjohnsonnyc  march    sarahpalinusa has your lazy ass ever finished a job   drew macdonald   drewyouriot  march    itstonynow what is sarah palin s job exactly  harvey k      krallenbauche  march    sarahpalinusa you dismiss donating to the needy as a political stunt   wilson   mikebabaganoosh  march    that s pretty much how it went until palin was so shamed that she took down her tweet and the article perhaps  next time  palin will criticize donald trump for cutting meals on wheels instead of attacking someone for helping them  of course  that would be something only a human being with a soul would do
