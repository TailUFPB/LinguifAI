trump s numerous attacks on former fbi director james comey are about to come back and bite him in the ass  while trump has spent his time attempting  poorly  to portray comey as someone who is unreliable and worse  the former director has spent his time writing a book the failing new york times  as the donald says  reports that comey s book will cover his work as a public servant   including and perhaps most notably his brief tenure in the trump administration  it s a book about leadership and his search for truth  informed by lessons and experiences he s had throughout his career  including his recent experiences in the trump administration   matt latimer  whose agency also represents comey  says   it will speak to a broader desire in our country for more ethical leadership it really does sound interesting  and it s no surprise that publishers are willing to hand comey ridiculous amounts of money for it the book will not be a conventional tell all memoir  but an exploration of the principles that have guided mr  comey through some of the most challenging moments of his legal career  among those are his investigation into hillary clinton s private email server during a contentious election  and his recent entanglement with the president over the f b i  s inquiry into russia s interference in the  election comey initially was reluctant to write a tell all  but ultimately decided that he had more to say than just a retelling of his career  the times notes that he plans to use the book to  write candidly about his experience serving in multiple administrations  and to use moments from his career to draw lessons about ethics  decision making and leadership  as with his personal memos he shared with the media through a friend  comey s book will be vetted to ensure that no classified information is contained while the book is simply going to be a study of comey s principles through the years  it is sure to enrage trump  who considers facts and truth to be an anathema featured image via screengrab
