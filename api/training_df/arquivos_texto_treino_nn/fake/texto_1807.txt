trump s syrian policy is all over the place  to the point where the economist actually published a story saying   wanted  a coherent syria policy   trump s position was  let syria handle its own problems   right up until assad dropped sarin gas on his people  it wasn t until the images of poisoned children started coming in that he decided we needed to respond  why trump s attorney  michael cohen  appeared on cnn with chris cuomo to discuss president flip flop s new syria policy  cuomo asked why trump would shift from a hands off syria policy to an intervene now policy  and cohen s response was downright frightening  when we were watching  whether it was here on cnn or any of the other stations  the syrian refugees that were leaving  they weren t the young  they weren t the aged  they weren t women  they were all these  to  year old men that when they were walking to these makeshift homes in germany that they put up for them  it looked like a military operation  cuomo responded by saying that those videos were selective  and the numbers and facts painted a very different picture of the refugees coming out of syria   yes  you have young men  but those refugees are the same people that the president is saying he cares so much about  cuomo is referring to the sheer hypocrisy of this administration s current syria policy  assad is gassed his own people  including women and children  but trump doesn t want to accept the refugees assad s regime creates  unfortunately  that didn t sway cohen  who doubled down on the idea that misleading videos are more reliable than data and facts cuomo  yeah  the question is  why were people picking those videos  was it misleading  the data would say yes cohen  but maybe it wasn t misleading  maybe it was more of the reality  what was going on cuomo  no  but the numbers  michael  say it s not the reality cohen  again  i don t want to start talking about numbers  numbers have not proven to suit me well and there it is  cohen and trump and probably a large chunk of the entire administration is too intellectually lazy to try and understand facts and data watch the full exchange below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
