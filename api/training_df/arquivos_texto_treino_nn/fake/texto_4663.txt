while the mainstream media and the hillary haters go on about her health and her campaign s refusal to disclose her pneumonia  two editors for major newspapers are thinking that trump s taxes are still a really big deal  a huge deal  so gigantic a deal that they d be willing to go to jail if it meant making them public dean baquet  executive editor for the new york times  and bob woodward  associate editor for the washington post  recently attended a forum where they spoke with laura poitras  the award winning filmmaker behind edward snowden s story  poitras asked them both if they would publish trump s taxes should they get hold of them  both editors said yes  and they would argue with the lawyers who would warn against that course of action to do it  baquet  explaining his reasoning  said trump s  whole campaign is built on his success as a businessman  and his wealth  and the tax returns could shed light on that  some things you have to do   woodward said in agreeing with baquet  trump doesn t have anything to hide  obviously  which is why his own running mate has released  years  worth of taxes  but trump himself hasn t released a single page  he keeps hiding behind an audit  even when told repeatedly that richard nixon released his taxes while being audited and the irs itself saying that excuse is full of bull cookies the thing is  trump and his businesses do so much with money that he could be under audit forever  meaning we ll never get to see the sheer perfection and wonder that are that man s tax returns  in truth  there s a growing possibility that those amazing returns aren t so amazing  and will make trump look worse than he already does trump could take a page from mitt romney  who paid a hefty price for waiting to release his returns  but he thinks mitt s choice to finally release them is what cost him the election  maybe he s afraid the same thing will happen to him trump s charitable donations  such as they are  have been under scrutiny  his business practices have come into question  and there are some who are even questioning his overall wealth  if his taxes reveal a whole lot of underhandedness and flat out lies  which they likely do   nobody with working brain cells will trust him trump has also said he works very hard to pay as little tax as possible  which doesn t sit well with many americans  maybe his tax returns show how he gets out of paying taxes in a way we little people  who he promises to stand for  can t there s all sorts of speculation about why he won t release his returns  but he should watch out   there are two editors for two major newspapers who would risk going to jail if it meant making that information public featured image by brian blanco getty images
