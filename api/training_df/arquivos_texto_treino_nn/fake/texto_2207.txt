the house s plan to repeal and replace the aca is catching an awful lot of flak from republicans and democrats alike  congressmen steve king of iowa  and leonard lance of new jersey  appeared on msnbc last night to discuss trumpcare  and chris hayes grilled them about how it will affect their constituents  neither was able to give him a real answer hayes asked king  how many people in your district are on the  exchanges  congressman  king s answer was the answer of someone who neither knows nor cares about his constituents   only his power and position  i don t know that number  you may have that in front of you  chris  but i don t know that number  hayes pressed lance on that  too  and lance tried to pass it off as a small number   i would say roughly   or so  chris  the thing is  those numbers are readily available  so there s zero excuse for them not knowing these answers furthermore  an interesting picture emerged last night   in lance s new jersey district  more than   people have insurance through the aca  but roughly   will lose their coverage under the gop s plan  in king s district  a little over   people have insurance through the aca  but over   stand to lose their coverage if the gop s plan passes so they re going to yank coverage away from more people than those who obtained it under the aca  wow  as u s  representatives  it s these guys  job to know this kind of thing about their districts so that they can support or oppose bills based on who they represent  they ve failed miserably but they d rather put party and ideology above their people  and king even believes that people have no right to health insurance  which means no right to healthcare  because without insurance  most of us can t afford medical care   he also believes that the best decisions are made by lawmakers closest to the people  so he s shucking his responsibility as a u s  representative both of them are sick for this watch both segments below  featured image via screen capture from embedded videos
