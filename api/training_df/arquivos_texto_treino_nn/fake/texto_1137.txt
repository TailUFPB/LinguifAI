for perhaps the first time since donald trump hit the political scene  he didn t make a bad situation worse by saying something self serving and inappropriate in the response to the shooting of republican rep  steve scalise  louisiana  during a practice of the gop congressional baseball team trump said  we may have our differences  but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation s capital is here because  above all  they love our country   trump said   we can all agree that we are blessed to be americans  that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good  source  chicago tribunepresident obama  who still knows many of the members of congress  also responded   with the class and deference we have come to expect  obama reached out to jeff flake  r arizona   who was on the field during the shooting  and despite being on the opposite side of the political aisle  was a friend of the former president flake was among the republicans gathered on an alexandria  va   baseball field when a shooter opened fire  wounding house majority whip steve scalise  r la   and several others  obama maintained a good working relationship with flake  who flew out to arizona with the former president in  after the shooting of then rep  gabrielle giffords  d ariz    this is particularly raw for those of us in arizona   flake told reporters of tuesday s shooting  adding that obama asked him to let scalise know the former president is thinking about him   he went through this a couple of times   flake added of obama source  politicoof course  many will question why obama didn t call all the congresspeople who were on the field that day and the answer is quite simple  he doesn t want to make it about himself  he simply wanted to send well wishes to a friend  that s class  of course  it could also be that he is weary from addressing all the mass shootings during his administration featured image via pool getty images
