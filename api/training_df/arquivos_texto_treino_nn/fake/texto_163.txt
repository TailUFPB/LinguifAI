no one on earth has been a bigger cheerleader for donald trump than fox news  sean hannity  in the wake of monday s indictments of former trump campaign manager paul manafort  manafort s top aide rick gates and with a guilty plea of former economic advisor to trump  george papadopoulos  it appears the house of cards is beginning to collapse hannity  though  is ready with the pro trump propaganda  immediately after the news of the indictment hit  hannity was ready with his defense of trump which means he s blaming hillary not that there wasn t russian collusion with a  presidential candidate  it s just that her name was not trump  we now have real evidence that the fbi uncovered a russian plot dating back to  that involved bribery  extortion  blackmail  money laundering and racketeering  it all came a year before hillary clinton and the obama administration approved the corrupt uranium one deal  we have evidence of another russia scandal  also involving a  candidate not named trump  we now know that the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee paid over   million to help fund the discredited  russia linked dossier crafted to ruin then candidate donald trump  this was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election not surprisingly  trump s statements are mirroring hannity sorry  but this is years ago  before paul manafort was part of the trump campaign  but why aren t crooked hillary   the dems the focus       donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     only  manafort was part of the trump campaign during many of these alleged crimes and hannity knows it  in fact  in   he tweeted it while a sean hannity tweet certainly won t stand up in a court of law  hannity has long been the media sycophant for the trump administration  if he says manafort was instrumental in trump winning the white house  he was featured image via drew angerer getty images
