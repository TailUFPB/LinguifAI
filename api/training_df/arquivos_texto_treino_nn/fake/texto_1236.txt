donald trump once again decided to waste precious speech time to bore americans with how hard his life is   and what he said is absolutely ridiculous on wednesday  trump gave a speech on infrastructure in cincinnati  ohio  like many of his previous speeches  trump proved that he is unable to stay focused for more than a few minutes  and he displayed his short attention span by getting completely off topic and complaining about how democrats have supposedly obstructed him trump began by ignoring the fact that he s about to get rocked by his russia scandal  as he pretended that a new era of american prosperity is about to begin  and you see it  it s already beginning   then  as with any trump speech  several minutes were spent bashing former president barack obama  trump said  to achieve our full economic strength  we must repeal and replace obamacare  now it is time for the senate  mitch mcconnell working very hard to act and save americans from this catastrophic event  because obamacare is dead  obamacare was one of the biggest broken promises in the history of politics  clearly  trump is choosing not to recognize the fact that trumpcare  more formally known as the american health care act  failed miserably while americans still overwhelmingly prefer obamacare  in fact  it was trump s own disastrous health care plan that helped more americans than ever voice their appreciation for obamacare trump then completely derailed to blast democrats for not supporting him and being  obstructionists  as he turned his infrastructure speech into a pity party of one  that s why i am calling on all the democrats  who honestly have really been obstructionists  boy  have they tried  every single thing  on healthcare  i won t get one vote on health care  obamacare is crashing  it s dead  it is in a death spiral as the head of one of the biggest insurance companies said  it is in a death spiral  we are coming out to do good  not to do bad  to do good  we won t get one democrat vote  they are just obstructionists  every single thing is obstruction  trump is literally acting like the republican party didn t obstruct obama for the entire  years of his presidency  it s absolutely pathetic  you can watch trump feel sorry for himself below featured image via pool   getty images
