after  years of endorsing republican candidates for president  the arizona republic decided that they could not  in good conscience  endorse donald trump  arizona is a solid red state with a solid red and oftentimes nutty conservative government  and some of the people of the state are so angry with the republic for endorsing hillary that the paper has lost subscribers and is now receiving death threats phil boas  who s in charge of the republic s editorial page  said  well  it s been crazy around here  we re getting a lot of reaction both locally and national  i don t believe true readers of the editorial page are surprised by all this at all  because over the past year we have been writing scathing  scalding articles about donald trump  there may be some  true readers  of the editorial page who are angry  but it s just as likely that these are primarily trumpkins and others who hate hillary with a passion  and are pissed off that  their  paper has betrayed them like this  trumpkins are known for advocating violence against anyone who disagrees with their chosen god  and trump himself eggs them on trumpkins sent death threats to delegates who didn t want to support trump at the rnc  the chairman of colorado s republican party was told to go kill himself  and to hide his family and pray he made it all the way to cleveland  a jewish writer for the huffington post got death threats and wishes after calling trump out for an anti semitic tweet trump and his loyal subjects have normalized this kind of behavior  unfortunately  this behavior can lead to domestic terrorism  and anyone who carries out these threats would be considered domestic terrorists boas  and the republic  are rightfully concerned about trump s strong desire to destroy the free press because he can t take criticism  it s also his misogyny  racism  lack of presidential temperament and lack of any real policy proposals that pushed the republic to endorse hillary  boas says the paper is  feeling the weight of our history  during this election cycle the republic may have endorsed the gop candidate had it been marco rubio or jeb bush   candidates that were actually respectful  respectable and  in comparison to trump  responsible  but they didn t  so the republic stands by its decision to endorse hillary  along with many other papers that have broken with decades of tradition  trump is too distasteful for them  and his fans are just as bad featured image by justin sullivan getty images
