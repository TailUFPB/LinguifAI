everyone is rightfully stunned and outraged that donald trump decided to inexplicably fire the man who was investigating his  presidential campaign s ties to russia  federal bureau of investigation director james comey  people are  also rightfully  suggesting that this firing is all part of a cover up   an attempt to squash the russia investigation  while there was likely nervousness related to the russia investigation that went into this decision  there is a much more trumpian reason for it  according to politico  a trump temper tantrum over the media s coverage of the criminal probe into the possibility of trump russia collusion comey recently testified on capitol hill that there is an ongoing investigation into russia s  election meddling  said probe includes the possibility that trump campaign officials coordinated with the russians in an attempt to tip the election to trump  of course  trump was outraged at this public scrutiny  and his ego cannot take the idea that anything but his own supposed brilliance won him the election  from politico he had grown enraged by the russia investigation  two advisers said  frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around russia  he repeatedly asked aides why the russia investigation wouldn t disappear and demanded they speak out for him  he would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe  one adviser said so  there you have it  trump was angry that comey s testimony had brought the russia story that refuses to go away back into the spotlight  and he was angry at his and his staff s inability to control it  trump has reportedly been considering getting rid of comey for roughly a week   which would mean that it was right around the time of comey s capitol hill testimony that the easily agitated president put his fbi director in the line of fire over russia this is nothing short of a constitutional crisis  we have no choice but to demand a   style independent commission on russia  as well as a special prosecutor for this case  no one appointed by trump   especially attorney general jeff sessions   should be anywhere near this probe this isn t partisan  this is about the soul of the republic  and we must get to the bottom of this  even as trump continues to make nixonian moves in fits of rage and attempts at cover ups featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
