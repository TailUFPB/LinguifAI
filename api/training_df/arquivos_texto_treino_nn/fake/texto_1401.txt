while donald trump is on a whirlwind world tour  the russian investigation is beginning to land uncomfortably close to home for trump  a member of his own family  his son in law jared kushner  is now reportedly a  person of interest  the washington post said a senior adviser to mr trump was among people investigators wanted to speak to  a new york magazine reporter then said the person in question was mr kushner    who is married to mr trump s eldest daughter and who flew out of washington on friday night to accompany the president on his first official foreign trip the post said the person under investigation was close to the president  but did not identify them  however  the number of people who fit such a profile would be very small source  independentannnd another bomb  russia probe sees a current trump official as a  significant person of interest   wapo reports  https   t co  pic twitter com xjmpuelxvo  daniel dale     may    reports  person of interest is a  wh official   officials had confirmed russia contact   of them works at wh  jared kushner  ari melber   arimelber  may    is the  person of interest  in the west wing that the feds are looking at  what an amazing end to the week   eric schmeltzer   justschmeltzer  may    this mean that an arrest of kushner is imminent  no  while things have begun escalating rather quickly  the washington post reports that criminal charges are likely not near right now  all of this is speculative  but when you connect the dots  they connect right to kushner  it could be that people behind the investigation believe that kushner is vulnerable and likely to talk  we already know that he made a lie of omission on his security clearance application and  forgot  to mention a meeting with russians  this makes him a fairly easy target in the investigation and as one of the few people to have the ear of trump  he likely knows a lot about all of the russian ties  he knows where all the bodies are buried  so to speak featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
