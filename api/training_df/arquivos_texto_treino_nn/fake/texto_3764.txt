when donald trump named steve bannon as his chief policy strategist  millions of americans expressed outrage and fear because of bannon s ties to white nationalists  who have been cheering about his appointment ever since it was announced but now bannon is giving americans even more reason to be scared during an interview with the hollywood reporter  bannon claimed that  darkness is good  and compared himself to satan  darth vader and dick cheny  darkness is good   bannon said   dick cheney  darth vader  satan  that s power  satan is the evil ruler of hell according to christians  so christians should probably start wondering if they put the anti christ in the white house darth vader is a particularly bad choice to compare oneself to considering how much the nazis influenced the themes and designs of star wars  including vader s helmet  the stormtroopers  and how democracy was turned over to a tyrant with applause so it s definitely an eerie comparison that may be serving as a shout out to neo nazis and dick cheney is a war criminal who signed off on torture and lied us into two wars that cost thousands of american lives and trillions of dollars bannon claimed that he  isn t a white nationalist  but said that trump s tenure in office will  be as exciting as the    you know  that decade when the great depression raged and fascism rose to power in europe which led to the most horrifying and destructive war in all of history  yeah  that  and as if bannon couldn t possibly say anything worse  he went on to say that he is the thomas cromwell of the trump administration  i am thomas cromwell in the court of the tudors   he said thomas cromwell was the chief minister to king henry viii  a despotic ruler of england who executed two of his wives seriously  bannon is not doing trump a service with these comparisons  if anything  he just gave more reasons for people to call for his ouster  why would anyone want to unite behind someone who has one of these evil people or characters as their chief adviser  steve bannon clearly is someone only white supremacists can love featured image  kirk irwin getty images
