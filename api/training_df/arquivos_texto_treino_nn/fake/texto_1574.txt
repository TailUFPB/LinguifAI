stephen colbert came under fire from conservatives this week for a late night monologue that could best be defined as a rant against donald trump  it ended with colbert saying   the only thing your mouth is good for is being vladimir putin s cock holster  this is far from the first time colbert has gone after trump  back in   when the potential to run for president was only a rumor  and when trump was best known for propagating the birther theory about president obama  colbert poked fun at trump s pointless and non sequitur way of speaking in the video  colbert began by talking about a gop presidential debate that barely anyone chose to attend  about halfway through  though  colbert started poking fun at trump s style of saying nothing but using a lot of words to do it  in this  trump compared gay marriage to using a long putter  post all jokes in the comments  trump  it s like in golf  a lot of people i don t want this to sound trivial but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters  very unattractive  it s weird  you see these great players with these really long putters  because they can t sink three footers anymore  and  i hate it  i am a traditionalist  i have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay  but i am a traditionalist colbert figured that that form of  logic  could be applied to other things as well  like raising the debt ceiling or medicare  he compared it to almond butter  medicare would be like cuff links here s the video colbert wasn t too far off at all  trump as oval office occupier continues the same sort of speaking style  often making no sense at all  the perfect example was when he was far more interested in the chocolate cake he was eating when he bombed syria than in the bombing itself  in fact  he forgot the name of the country he bombed featured image via screen capture from embedded video
