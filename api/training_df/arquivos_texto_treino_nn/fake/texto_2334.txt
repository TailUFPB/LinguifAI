a cowardly republican gave a racist excuse for why he doesn t want to face his constituents at a town hall as angry americans show up to town halls to give their republican representatives hell over their obsession with repealing the affordable care act  an illinois republican has decided that he doesn t care about his constituents enough to take criticism from them in person rep  mike bost has been largely ducking his constituents by holding tele town halls that they aren t informed about until the last minute  which means not a lot of people are able to participate  those that do are dedicated supporters who will agree with everything bost says without any push back whatsoever  the in person ones going on around the united states right now are out of control  which means you don t actually get to talk to people and listen  and we re looking for ways to do that   bost told the southern illinoisan and then bost made a racist comparison to describe the angry people who are attending town halls  the amount of time that i have at home is minimal  i need to make sure that it s productive  you know the cleansing that the orientals used to do where you d put one person out in front and  people yell at them  that s not what we need  we need to have meetings with people that are productive  i m not going to have the public town hall meetings  in that respect  because i am busy trying to work on the issue   bost continued   if all you want to do is stand and yell at me   we re not going back and forth  what bost wants is a town hall where he won t be criticized and won t have to answer the criticism  you know  because bost and republicans like him are snowflakes who want to pretend that everyone likes them and what they are doing in congress republicans know that repealing the affordable care act is getting more and more unpopular as their own constituents begin to realize that they will lose their own healthcare to explain the anger at town halls  republicans have falsely portrayed their own constituents as out of state paid protesters rather than admit that they are wrong to repeal the landmark healthcare program but as republicans continue to duck their voters they will only make them angrier in the long run  when the  midterm election comes around they won t be able to avoid the voice of the people then  and they will discover quickly that they made a huge mistake by not facing their constituents when they had a chance featured image via st  louis public radio
