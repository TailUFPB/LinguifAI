donald trump is the first authoritarian president we have ever had  of course  one of the hallmarks of autocrats is that they destabilize trust in the free press and eventually attempt to squash the fourth estate altogether  trump has done a remarkable job of implementing this dangerous autocratic strategy with his base  therefore  it is absolutely vital that news outlets make sure that everything they do is on the up and up  this is especially true of outlets that are favorite targets of trump s such as cnn unfortunately  it seems that cnn is dropping the ball there in a major way  case in point   they had a white supremacist sit on a nationally televised panel about the debate over whether or not the deferred action for childhood arrivals program   otherwise known as daca   should be rescinded by the trump administration on monday s edition of its early show  cnn had a panel discussion regarding the program that protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought here through no fault of their own by their parents and know no other home  on the panel were democratic strategist maria cordona  and dan stein of the foundation for american immigration reform  fair   however  there was one particularly disturbing detail that cnn left out of stein s introduction  that his organization has a long history of trafficking in white supremacy  luckily for the sake of public information  think progress s judd legum did it for them  legum writes  cnn did not mention fair s deep roots in white supremacy  eugenics  and white nationalism  the organization was founded by john tanton  who founded fair to keep america  a majority white population  heidi beirich of the southern poverty law center says of the founder of fair   has corresponded with holocaust deniers  former klan lawyers and the leading white nationalist thinkers of the era  he introduced key fair leaders to the president of the pioneer fund  a white supremacist group set up to encourage  race betterment   at a  meeting at a private club  he wrote a major funder to encourage her to read the work of a radical anti semitic professor   to  give you a new understanding of the jewish outlook on life    and suggested that the entire fair board discuss the professor s theories on the jews  judd legum goes on to say that stein  said he believes america s immigration laws  which he regards as too permissive  are an effort  to retaliate against anglo saxon dominance   he said that the current generation of immigrants is engaged in  competitive breeding  and that  any of them hate america  hate everything the united states stands for  as for stein s contributions to the cnn panel on monday morning  he insisted that daca is nothing more than arbitrary amnesty program   and said that democrats should be forced to help the gop secure the borders  build the wall  interior enforcement and cut chain migration  if they want to protect the daca kids  in other words  make sure we keep america mostly white  no more brown people for this guy now  cnn has some great anchors  they really do  personally  i try to tear myself away from msnbc in order to watch them sometimes   particularly outfront with erin burnett and the lead with jake tapper  that being said  i have never been comfortable with their penchant for allowing trump supporters to spew unchecked lies on the air  in this climate of deteriorating confidence in the fourth estate and confusion about what is and isn t true  these practices are hardly in the interest of the public good  now  they have white supremacists as panelists  somehow believing that these views should be given mainstream legitimacy get your act together cnn  this is why i definitely prefer msnbc watch this appalling discussion below featured image via video screen capture
