as time goes on  it becomes ever clearer that trump is russia s puppet  there s every possibility he owes them money  and he s repeatedly blasted our intelligence community for daring to say that russia did  indeed  engage in a concerted campaign to influence our election in trump s favor  but did he always feel this way  was he always russia s puppet it seems not  and it s by his own words that we know this  as recently as   he said  in a series of interviews  that mitt romney was right to say that russia was our greatest geopolitical foe   said  a hell of a problem  and everybody laughed at him  including certain media  by the way  they laughed  it turned out that he s absolutely right  you look at what russia s doing with iran  how they controlled the situation  and syria  and virtually every other place  he also insinuated that obama was putin s puppet because he felt we being meek and cowardly in the face of such a threat  we should definitely be strong  we should definitely do sanctions  and we have to show some strength  i mean  putin has eaten obama s lunch  therefore our lunch  for a long period of time  now he says he s open to lifting our sanctions on russia if we can all just get along  which is never going to happen because russia is ruled by an autocrat  if we lift the sanctions  russia will pull trump s puppet strings even more  he also seems to like to kiss putin s ass  mouth  and dick   he doesn t criticize russia at all  and staunchly defends them against other criticisms and revelations here s his stance back in  in other words  this is another position on which he s flip flopped  he just says whatever his strongest manhandlers want him to say  whether they re his supporters  or foreign powers hoping to use him for their own gain  he says whatever he thinks will win him the most points featured image by spencer platt via getty images
