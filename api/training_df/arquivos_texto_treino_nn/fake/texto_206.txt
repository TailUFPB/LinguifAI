west virginia is solid trump country  the argument has been made that the opioid crisis  along with the  forgotten  population of white working class voters  is the reason for that state being overwhelmingly trump nation  however  there is one element that cannot be ignored here  those same white working class voters also feature a lot of racists who hate president barack obama  and the ultimate way to stick it to him was to put donald trump in the white house well  it seems that putting trump in power wasn t enough for these people  even though the orange fascist has been steadily shredding the country  degrading the office of the presidency  emboldening our adversaries and scaring the hell out of our allies for nigh on a year now  these people simply cannot resist the temptation to attack president obama in ever more stunningly racist ways  case in point   a halloween costume display in spirit halloween in triadelphia  west virginia the display features an extremely racist depiction of president obama in the form of a mask   complete with a watermelon costume in the same display  and banana costumes a shelf or two over  according to my friend and colleague john prager  who shot the video of the shocking racism on the part of this retailer below this just goes to show how racist certain people in this country are  this entire display is dripping with racist stereotypes  and it uses our first african american president s image to reinforce them  we need to confront this bigotry  rather than brushing it under the rug as  economic anxiety   or whatever other excuses we ve been letting float out there for people voting for this despicable excuse for a human being  trump is a crude  crass  rude  misogynistic bigot  there is not one excuse on the face of the earth for voting for a blatant white supremacist  and even less than that for continuing to excuse the behavior of so many of his voters shame on you  spirit halloween  it s time for a boycott  just in time for the best holiday of the year featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
