linda mcmahon  trump s pick to head the small business administration  has been making headlines because of her unsavory career building the wwe  however  those headlines have been hiding a sinister fact that everyone should be aware of  the mcmahons are major funders of trump  they ve given the trump foundation and super pacs supporting the candidate millions of dollars  a donor is being given a spot on the incoming administration here s more  from the new civil rights movement donald trump has named former wwe ceo linda mcmahon to become his small business administration chief  mcmahon gave a trump super pac   million during the final months of the campaign  despite having denounced his comments about women as  deplorable  mcmahon  who ran for the u s  senate in connecticut but failed  twice  is the top outside donor  along with her husband  to the trump foundation  giving the controversial family charity   million between  and   more than trump himself gave apparently  she s totally fine with trump s comments as long as she gets to buy a spot on his administration as trump said when speaking about the clinton foundation   follow the money   if she s not buying a position in the administration  why would you appoint someone who has donated over   million to support you  after all  the appearance of impropriety and impropriety itself are often not far separate in public life  where perception can be everything  it s very obvious that donald trump is either corrupt  or doesn t care if people think he s corrupt  and considering his settlement for fraud  thousands of stiffed contractors  thousands upon thousands of lawsuits  and general business record  it seems most likely it s the former option can you imagine the level of scrutiny hillary clinton would have faced if she appointed someone to her hypothetical administration who had donated over   million to her  conservatives would be frothing at the mouth   and rightfully so  in that case  pay to play is simply not the way a government should be run  of course  since it s trump  conservatives are silent plus  she s not even qualified like many of the president elect s cabinet appointments  mcmahon s professional qualifications appear to be out of step with the duties she will assume when she is confirmed  despite her family s entrepreneurial streak  the wwe has a near monopolization over the industry and has been accused of allegedly prioritizing money over the health of its wrestlers   we of course had a responsibility to our shareholders   mcmahon told the times in response  denying the allegations   but every good chief executive understands that in addition to maintaining profitability  companies that hope to be successful in the long term absolutely have to put people first   whether mcmahon will be able to use her experience with big business to benefit small businesses around america has yet to be seen   source this is just more evidence that trump is doing the opposite of  draining the swamp   he s business as usual on steroids featured image via sara d  davis getty images
