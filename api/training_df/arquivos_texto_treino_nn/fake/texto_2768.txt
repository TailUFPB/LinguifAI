if there s one thing donald trump hates  it s being criticized and told he s not good at his job  he has a very fragile ego which  in turn  prevents him from leading properly  because if you re not able to accept criticism or advice and grow from it  you re never going to be able to efficiently lead  being president needs to be about what s best for the people  not what s best for the current mood of the man in charge pointing out how damaging trump is already being to the united states is none other than the legendary author stephen king  in a viral tweet  he describes trump with a perfect metaphor king tweeted out  imagine a hooligan pouring sugar into the gas tank of an expensive and well maintained car  trump is that hooligan  america is that car  imagine a hooligan pouring sugar into the gas tank of an expensive and well maintained car  trump is that hooligan  america is that car   stephen king   stephenking  january    he s exactly right  in fact  describing trump as merely a hooligan may be far too kind  trump s destructive and bigoted behavior is going to lead the united states down a very dark path  just like pouring sugar in a gas tank will destroy a car  trump s plans for the nation will subsequently destroy everything that has made america great undoubtedly  trump will be furious that king made such a criticism of his behavior  who knows  maybe king will even get an infantile tweet storm thrown directly at him hopefully  congress  scotus  the aclu  the media  etc  will hold trump accountable for all the horrendous things he has already done and plans to do featured photo by this robinson  andrew harrer pool getty images
