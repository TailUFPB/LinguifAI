after an epic twitter tantrum in which he yelled at puerto rico for being knocked down by two hurricanes and cried giant crocodile tears about  fake news   trump decided he d try shaming the nfl with a video from an nhl game  at that game  the audience stands up and sings the national anthem  one might think that this just happened  but it didn t  the video in question is almost a year old   respecting our national anthem   standforouranthem   pic twitter com czutygamqv  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    original video is on nhl on nbc sports  facebook page  dated nov      the day after the election that gave us this walking shitshow to begin with  why does this matter  because trump is still going on about nfl players kneeling during the anthem on twitter  earlier today  in the midst of all the ranting about nobody giving him his due credit for the farce of a relief effort in puerto rico  he tweeted this very important that nfl players stand tomorrow  and always  for the playing of our national anthem  respect our flag and our country   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    brought the issue into sharp relief last week when he went on a tear about  disrespect  to the flag and called on nfl owners to fire players who won t stand  many nfl players retaliated by kneeling  the pittsburgh steelers didn t even come out of the locker room  and many owners issued statements rebuking trump in one way or another so trump  in an attempt to shame what the nfl is doing now  shares a video that s a year old  in truth  the nhl seems rather split on how they feel about kneeling during the national anthem  there are  however  several players and coaches who believe it s everyone s right to protest how they see fit  as part of the first amendment  trump just embarrassed the hell out of himself featured image via drew angerer getty images
