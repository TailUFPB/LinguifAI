u s  sen  ted cruz was against federal aid for natural disasters until he was for it  the texas senator voted against federal funding for victims of hurricane sandy  the deadliest and most destructive hurricane in the atlantic in   but now he wants funds after hurricane harvey barreled down on his state  at least  people have died after harvey hit texas  more than   people have been rescued as responders work around the clock in devastating conditions during a press conference on monday  cruz said that trump has pledged  whatever the state needs  for water soaked texas  but  just after that presser  cruz was in the awkward position of having to defend his position to msnbc s katy tur on the  hurricane sandy relief package  calling it  filled with unrelated pork  there is time for political sniping later   cruz said without one bit of irony or acknowledgement of his hypocrisy  it s not really political sniping  senator   tur shot back   these are people who needed money and who needed funding right after that storm  i covered those people  many of them  just like those in houston  lost absolutely everything they owned  cruz told tur that hurricane relief is a  vital  central role  of the federal government and should continue to be for a long time  the problem with that particular bill is it became a   billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork   cruz said  two thirds of that bill had nothing to do with sandy   he continued   and what i said then and still believe now is that it s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people who are hurting to pay for their own political wish list  disaster relief needs to be focused on the victims of disaster relief  and i supported that for sandy  disaster relief there  and i would support that anywhere there s a major disaster without getting distracted by political  unnecessary pork spending   he added the washington post begs to differ with cruz the congressional research service issued a comprehensive report on the provisions  and it s clear that virtually all of it was related to the damage caused by sandy  there may have been some pork in an earlier senate version  but many of those items were removed before final passage  there were also some items that appear to have been misunderstood regardless  ted cruz voted against it but now he wants all that delicious disaster relief money for his state  and  texas should get that money asap  the victims of sandy should have  too image via screen capture
