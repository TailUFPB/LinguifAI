president barack obama hasn t exactly kept his disgust and disdain for republican nominee donald trump a secret  but he made it hilariously obvious when he appeared on monday night s late show with stephen colbert  as the two men brutally mocked the gop s sorry excuse for a presidential candidate on the show  obama sat down with host stephen colbert  who tries to disguise himself so he can subtly ask the president how he feels about this election s presidential candidates  because he couldn t flat out ask obama how he really felt  colbert found an interesting way to get the information out of our commander in chief  by asking him to choose between two snacks colbert asked obama to make a decision between  an extra fiber nutrient bar which has traveled to more than  countries  or this shriveled tangerine covered in golden retriever hair  filled with bile  that i wouldn t leave alone with the woman i love   by the description alone  we all know just which snack represented what candidate but the visual made the whole thing even more hilarious  in all honesty  the tangerine wasn t too far off from being an exact replica of trump anyway you can watch the clip below to see colbert and obama both poke fun of america s worse presidential candidate to date wherein  potus makes an important snack decision   watch the rest tonight on  lssc   pic twitter com   the late show   colbertlateshow  october    by trump s twitter activity over the last few hours  the business mogul may have already seen this clip   because he was caught dissing obama shortly after colbert tweeted the clip  and obama s decision  twitterbitter  much  trump s emotions are running high right now  and he must be terrified to face off with clinton again during wednesday night s debate  he s unraveling fast  and i m sure having the president of the united states insult you only adds insult to injury featured image via screenshots
