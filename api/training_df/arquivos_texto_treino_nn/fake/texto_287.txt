it s no secret that donald trump s response to the crisis in puerto rico has been nothing but disappointing  while us citizens were begging for disaster relief  trump was staying at his golf club  turning his back on them  the washington post ran a story about trump s negligence last night  stating that trump went mia for four entire days while puerto rico suffered  focusing all of his attention on attacking nfl players and north korean dictator kim jong un after seeing the washington post s report  a former obama administration official lashed out at trump on twitter  providing the undeserving potus with a much needed reality check   and he didn t hold back as he said trump  makes me so mad i could spit   former us foreign disaster assistance chief jeremy konyndyk noted how  damning  the report was and tore the trump administration a new one  in a massive tweetstorm  konyndyk gave trump a lesson he ll never forget         this is one of the most brutal critiques we ve gotten so far in regards to trump s handling of puerto rico   malpractice  is truly a perfect word  because trump really should have been all over this  it is his duty as potus   and yet he has almost completely ignored the situation  people are dying and begging for assistance  and trump has jetted off to his golf course in new jersey for the weekend  we cannot think of a more self centered  irresponsible response to a major crisis that has already resulted in the loss of human life  trump has made it perfectly clear that he doesn t give a damn america has truly been put in danger with trump as president of the united states  puerto rico proves that he is unfit to lead a country and be responsible for the lives of its citizens featured image via pool   getty images
