ever since the leaked tape of donald trump s hot mic before appearing on access hollywood revealing he has sexually assaulted women  many have been weighing in on what the candidate is calling  locker room talk  trump apparently thinks that it is perfectly fine to talk about being sexually aggressive towards women without their consent  and also apparently thinks that this is what men talk about in locker rooms well  one man who spends a lot of time in locker rooms is speaking up and calling out trump  and that person is none other than the legendary nba champ lebron james james told reporters what actually goes on in locker rooms  which usually has a lot to do with what happened during the game  he also said  that s not locker room talk  that s trash talk  emphasizing the fact that he has many women in his life  as well as children  and wouldn t want that sort of talk around them  nor does he think it is okay good on james for speaking out against trump and his crude and horrific talk  hopefully  this becomes a trend  and more and more athletes take a stand against the reality television host trump shouldn t be allowed near women  let alone the oval office  remember to vote blue this november  watch the video here lebron weighs in on donald trump   that s not locker room talk  that s trash talk    via  hgrove  pic twitter com bxqxrewsno  bleacher report   bleacherreport  october    image via video screen capture
