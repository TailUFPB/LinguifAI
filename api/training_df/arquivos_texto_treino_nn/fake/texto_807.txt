while donald trump hasn t exactly made an admission of guilt in the russian scandal  but in a shocking story that just broke in the washington post  he s at least privately entertaining the idea that he will be prosecuted and possibly found guilty  now he s asking if he can pardon family members  staff and even himself trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides  family members and even himself in connection with the probe  according to one of those people  a second person said trump s lawyers have been discussing the president s pardoning powers among themselves trump s legal team declined to comment on the issue  but one adviser said the president has simply expressed a curiosity in understanding the reach of his pardoning authority  as well as the limits of mueller s investigation  this is not in the context of   i can t wait to pardon myself   a close adviser said source  washington postthis report comes in the same day a new york times interview was published with trump  in the interview  he appeared to threaten special counselor robert mueller if mueller dared look into trump s personal finances asked if mr  mueller s investigation would cross a red line if it expanded to look at his family s finances beyond any relationship to russia  mr  trump said   i would say yes   he would not say what he would do about it   i think that s a violation  look  this is about russia  mueller didn t care  though  on the same day the interview was printed  it was revealed that mueller s office is indeed investigating trump s businesses  which may be why the sudden interest in trump pardoning everyone around him  including himself as for whether he can do that  well  the constitution and history are unclear  no president has tried to pardon himself  nixon thought about it before he resigned and his lawyer advised him that it was within his realm of authority  note that a president doesn t have to wait till there are convictions to grant pardons so what would happen if trump attempted a self pardon  first  some pardon fundamentals  article ii  section   clause  of the u s  constitution gives the president the power to  grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the united states  except in cases of impeachment   pardons thus can only cover federal criminal offenses and cannot thwart an impeachment  which technically is not a criminal prosecution anyway    the prosecutor s argument  while much more complicated  is a stronger one  first  a textual argument  the word  pardon  means something inherently bilateral  something that a sovereign bestows upon a subject  consider more colloquially that you can beg someone else s pardon  but you never seek or receive one from yourself  while there is admittedly no explicit limitation on self pardons  there is no need for one  because a self pardon is by definition not a  pardon   other examples show that the pardon power is subject to inherent limitations like this  for instance  the law is clear that a pardon cannot be prospective   it can only reach offenses committed before the pardon is issued   but that limit is not spelled out in the constitution either  it is implicit in the definition of a  pardon  as opposed to a suspension of the law source  foreign policywhether or not it can be done  it would set a very bad precedence and one that even the most partisan republicans in congress would find toxic  it could also be very bad for trump s businesses featured image via sean gallup getty images
