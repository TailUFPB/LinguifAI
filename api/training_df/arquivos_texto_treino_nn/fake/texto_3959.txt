less than a week before one of the most important presidential elections of our lifetimes  the focus has been turned to one part of the executive branch  the fbi  director james comey has come under an extraordinary amount of criticism for his apparent combing of files to release everything  anything  that could be construed as anti clinton  many are even calling him an arm of the republican party this latest revelation isn t going to change any of his critics  minds  it seems that the fbi twitter account  which hadn t tweeted for more than a year  suddenly had some undeniably partisan tweets the first came on october   when the fbi twitter account tweeted  strangely and seemingly out of the blue  about donald trump s father fred c  trump  fred c  trump     was a real estate developer and philanthropist  this release consists of  https   t co   fbi records vault   fbirecordsvault  october    tweet mysteriously left out the parts about the elder trump s involvement with the kkk and his racist business practices there was actually a rash of tweets that day  but most weren t political  still  it was an odd time for the dormant account to suddenly come to life on november   there was one more tweet  this time  it was directed right to bill clinton william j  clinton foundation  this initial release consists of material from the fbi s files related to the will  https   t co   fbi records vault   fbirecordsvault  november    was it  the account now appears to be back in hibernation  but the tweets are undergoing an internal investigation  because regardless  someone broke the law  the fbi  according to their own rules and according to federal law  is not allowed to influence elections  candice will  assistant director for the fbi s office of professional responsibility  said she was referring the matter to the fbi s inspection division for an  investigation   upon completion of the investigation  the findings will be referred back to the the office of professional responsibility for  adjudication   source  think progressthe results of this investigation  unfortunately  will probably not be released before the election next tuesday  but this  if anything  is simply more proof that the fbi  and in particular  james comey  is holding his thumb on the scale trying to elect donald trump featured image via alex wong getty images
