during donald trump s most recent rally in tampa  florida  he went on and one about the size of his dick crowd  as if that is representative of poll numbers  which ironically show him losing nationwide because the cameras shooting the event didn t show the entire crowd size  trump thought it wise to say that the room was packed to the corners and beats any crowd his opponent hillary clinton gets what trump didn t think to realize would be that reporters  like the washington post s ed o keefe  would quickly prove trump to be a pants on fire liar mcliarface watch o keefe s video here video  again   trump state fair hall not packed full as he falsely claims  pic twitter com rqnkopjzhz  ed o keefe   edatpost  august    only is trump lying  he s doing a horrific job of it  it s as if he doesn t think any of the press would quickly scan the room to notice that the room not only isn t packed but is barely filled at all it s amazing that trump will tout lie after lie after lie and his supporters eat it up with a spoon  all the while believing that it s hillary clinton who is the actual liar  even though she was found to be the most fundamentally honest candidate out of anyone who ran on either side you can  quite literally  listen to trump and everything out of his mouth speaking against hillary is what someone has said about him  it s classic projecting and it s not even hidden well  it s actually quite sad that so many are still falling for it  however  those people vote and we need to make sure to get out the vote ourselves and make sure trump doesn t get anywhere near the oval office featured image via video screen capture
