donald trump s executive order barring people from entering the united states from seven countries in the middle east exposed his violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution and a house democrat took him to task for it on thursday during a speech on the house floor when trump signed the executive order last friday  he targeted people traveling for nations that are not responsible for any deaths of american citizens on american soil  despite claiming that his order is meant to protect americans from terrorists trump even invoked   to justify the order  but left countries off the list where many of the hijackers came from  such as saudi arabia  which also helped fund them and their operation the nations trump conveniently left off the list also have something else in common  they all have business ties with the trump organization in other words  trump is a complete hypocrite and is making foreign policy decisions based on whether they will hurt his family s business or not and wisconsin rep  mark pocan absolutely hammered trump for it on the house floor with a devastating speech  these countries were excluded from the executive order despite being home to many of the terrorists who carried out     pocan pointed out   i m not saying we should ban people from these countries  i firmly oppose any ban based on nationality or religion  but it is unacceptable that business interests have played potentially a role in such a destructive policy  a policy that also makes our country less safe in the long run  pocan explained that trump s business interests in the countries left off the list influenced his decision to not include them even though trump repeatedly declared that he would make america safe by blocking nations where terrorists come from to attack us  trump clearly believes that maintaining his business interests are more important than banning travel from saudi arabia  the country where most of the   attackers were from and received their funding  it s time for the president to stop defending his divisive and unconstitutional executive order and start being transparent about his business interests   pocan said   every president in the modern era has released tax records to ensure the american people that their actions will not be impacted by financial holdings  indeed  richard nixon was the first president to release his tax records to the public  and that set a precedent that all presidential candidates have followed over the decades  trump broke that precedent and refused to release his taxes because he is hiding his numerous business connections with nations like russia that would expose him and his treachery to the american people  trump now says he won t release his taxes at all despite promising that he would do so after an audit is completed  even though an audit does not prevent someone from releasing their tax records pocan then demanded that trump release his taxes  divest himself from his company  and repeal his executive order or else face legislative action  including the possibility of impeachment  mr  president  it s time for you to fix this  one  divest your business holding immediately to remove any suggestion of conflicts in your decision making  two  show us your tax returns so financial interests are transparent to the american people  and three  get rid of your unconstitutional executive order  which will make us less safe and only serve to embolden our enemies  short of that  we ll have to take other actions  including legislative directives  resolutions of disapproval and even explore the power of impeachment  the speaker then whined about pocan threatening impeachment as if republicans hadn t been calling for impeaching president obama over the last eight years here s the video via youtube donald trump is a liar and a traitor who is putting his business interests ahead of the best interests of the american people  not only should he be impeached  his entire administration should be removed  and democrats could get the chance to do exactly that if americans vote in  to take the house away from the republican majority featured image via alex wong getty images
