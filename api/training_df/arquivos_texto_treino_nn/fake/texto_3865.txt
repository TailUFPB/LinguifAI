americans woke up on to a country that will soon have donald trump serving as president  it is a frightening realization  however  overcome with horror  the irony of the date went largely unnoticed by many  november   the day after election day  is the anniversary of the berlin wall coming down on this day in   the spokesman for east berlin s communist party announced that citizens of the gdr would be permitted to freely cross the country s borders  the scene of east and west berliners flooding to the site became iconic  people used hammers and picks to chip away at the wall  the reunification of east and west germany was made official on october     almost one year after the fall of the berlin wall  while almost three decades ago this date became synonymous with freedom in the hearts and minds of so many  americans woke up today to a president elect that plans to build a wall of his own  since the very beginning of his election  trump has promised to build a wall along the border between mexico and the united states  of course  he still insists that mexico is going to pay for it  anti immigrant rhetoric served as the foundation of trump s campaign and the wall was his keystone anti immigrant rhetoric has served as the foundation of trump s campaign and the wall has been his keystone  while most of us were simply overwhelmed by the reality of a trump presidency  some couldn t help but notice the date and point out the irony the sad irony is that the  berlinwall came down today in  and  presidenttrump is about to build a new one that will be just as brutal   harry leslie smith   harryslaststand  november    is said that those who don t learn from history are doomed to repeat it  it certainly looks as if we have an awful lot to learn  this is more proof of just how far backward we have to go for trump to  make america great again   we took one step forward  years ago  and today  we took  steps back featured image via history com
