as former fbi director james comey gave his testimony today  several gems were revealed in the process  one of the most notable moments was when comey trashed trump s credibility  as he stated that the reason he had documented his meetings with trump and not former presidents george w  bush and barack obama was because he felt trump in particular was untrustworthy comey called trump a liar when he was testifying before the senate  while he was describing the reasons why trump had fired him several weeks ago  as soon as comey said this  the white house collectively lost his mind and went right into doing damage control  in response  white house deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders held an off camera briefing in which she  too  lied her ass off  sanders stated  i can definitively say the president is not a liar  you can only imagine how america has responded to this  in fact  the entire country is pretty much either laughing or face palming right now     trump has proven the be the most dishonest president the country has ever had  according to politifact  only  percent of trump s statements are true  trump scored far lower than any of the other  presidential candidates when they were rated on honesty  which should have been a major red flag to trump s supporters  if they had only been a little smarter it is truly a sad day when americans cannot trust their president or the administration behind them  the white house s defense of trump is unforgivable  and proves that america has lost all credibility and respect with the world  trump and his minions are a joke  and they are embarrassing what was once the most respected country  to say that trump isn t a liar is just about the worst thing you can do   because everyone knows the truth featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
