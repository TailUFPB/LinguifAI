donald trump will explode when he reads this trump is a national embarrassment who never should have been allowed to run for the presidency to begin with  his antics during the campaign and after have divided the country and turned us into an laughingstock around the world throughout his campaign  trump attacked latinos  women  african americans  muslims  and jews  he constantly bullied and threatened people  and he even urged russia to hack hillary clinton and the dnc since taking office  trump has been disastrous for our country  his scandals are racking up as much as his frequent golf trips and it s clear that trump is incapable of governing responsibly and ethically  trump has also embarrassed himself repeatedly on twitter and often opens his mouth when he should keep it shut and that s why  year old owen pallenberg wrote a poem all about trump s campaign and his various antics at the time and in the present day  the race  begins with the campaign  takes us to the depressing election  and concludes with the aftermath and what should be done to rid our country of trump here s the full poem via huffington post a man and a woman were running a race the man dressed in red with a very orange face and the woman dressed in blue with a pantsuit and a briefcase the race was much longer than a dash  mile or marathon and to many americans it felt like it went on and on this was a race of old and new ideas and one thought and so the race started with the sound of a gunshot the woman dressed in blue was off to a great start she was gaining support and was eager to do her part however the man in the red was racist and sexist i m sure you would agree he even said he wanted to grab a woman by her as the competitors turned the corner you got a glimpse of the fans and you could hear in the distance a chant about a man with small hands he claimed his hands and feet were quite big all while having a bright orange spray tan and a big yellow wig about halfway through the race the man was falling behind and the supporters of the woman were happy to have saved mankind as the competitors were nearing the finish line the people in blue were already celebrating and drinking their wine the woman approached the finish with a big  wide grin but then something happened that seemed to be the work of vladimir putin the woman fell down and lost her lead the win began to feel a lot less guaranteed the man hurdled over her body and crossed the finish and we all knew our nation s reputation would certainly diminish the man had somehow done it  he actually won the supporters in blue sat in shock and ceased all of their fun the man was apparently going to make america great again with his campaign and the woman was depressed and had to put away her celebratory champagne  the results of this race tore apart our land as millions of muslims were immediately banned this man can do absolutely no good except run his mouth and claim he was just misunderstood the man has stated  we need global warming  for all to hear which has made me quite certain that the end is near he has called women ugly and fat which has left me wondering how he could have won the race and done all that after insulting and making fun of men and women nationwide i ve become mortified  horrified  and have lost my american pride everytime he talks or makes a speech all i can say is impeach  impeach  impeach now we just have to wait until donald trump becomes the first president to attack a  year old kid that would be a new low featured image  mario tama getty images
