on monday  the election of donald trump became official  last week  though  a e  home of the  duck dynasty  clan  announced that they are giving a voice to the real klan  the ku klux klan is getting their own show beginning in january  a e will be broadcasting a show called  generation kkk   this show isn t exactly like  duck dynasty   instead of a long running reality show  this is being billed as an eight part documentary  a e denied that they will be giving a platform to the klan  but it s doubtful the klan would have agreed to do the documentary if it didn t humanize them that meant finding a delicate balance between winning the trust of the klan members and ensuring the show didn t propagate views the network s executives abhor   we certainly didn t want the show to be seen as a platform for the views of the kkk   said rob sharenow  general manager of a e   the only political agenda is that we really do stand against hate  the struggles we were most drawn to were the struggles with the internal families   said mr  james  an executive producer of the series  whose previous credits include tlc s  i am jazz   about the transgender teenager jazz jennings   we had a stance  and we were clear with folks that we were hoping for them to see the light and to come out of this world  it s an incredibly destructive environment for anybody to be in  let alone children  source  new york timeson one level  this might make sense  perhaps some kkk members will become more sympathetic to people of color or lgbt people just by getting to know them  but there is a far greater risk  and that is normalization of the klan no one is saying this show is the result of trump s election  in fact  it s been in the works since about the time trump began his run  but there is a media trend of normalizing the deplorable  yes  that is the correct word   even so called liberal npr has begun normalizing the  alt right    hell  even the term alt right normalizes racism  xenophobia  nationalism  misogyny and homophobia  just a week after the election  npr ran a story on steve bannon  who has long been giving a voice to neo nazis and other deplorables through his blog  breitbart com  npr called bannon a  national hero  let s hear a defense of steve bannon   npr host steve inskeep began  offering a view of exactly what direction this interview would take  pollak started by launching into a gushing assessment of bannon  calling him  a national hero   and talking about how it s so great we ll have someone  so calm under pressure in the white house    maybe this is true  though it contradicts accusations against bannon of domestic abuse  sexual harassment and being a  verbally abus   bully   who is prone to a lot of tirades  by former staffers   when inskeep interjected to ask about bannon s tireless work to turn breitbart into the alt right outlet of choice  pollak attempted to distance the site from the movement it has nurtured on a steady diet of xenophobia  racism  sexism and anti semitism source  alternetperhaps if clinton had won the electoral vote  generation kkk would be slightly less offensive  but trump  with his hiring of deplorables in his cabinet  is normalizing the kkk and racism in general  trump ran a campaign of hate  he s putting together a coalition of hate  is it any wonder that suddenly  hate is cool  we don t need to hear the views of the kkk  we know the views of the kkk  generation kkk won t be educational  it will be obscene featured image via martin flickr
