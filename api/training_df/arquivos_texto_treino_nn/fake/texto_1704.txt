in the late  century  author and attorney mike godwin said that  as an online discussion grows longer  the probability of a comparison involving hitler approaches   soon  though   godwin s law  was used to invalidate any mention of hitler  which effectively worked to white wash a significant portion of  century history who knows  that could be why we re seeing a rise in holocaust denial and the election of donald trump  now  a yale professor is taking on that very issue  saying that our fear of making hitler comparisons is making us historically illiterate yale history professor  and author of  on tyranny  twenty lessons from the twentieth century   timothy snyder isn t going so far to say that trump is like hitler  but he is saying that there are a lot of lessons to be learned from hitler  specifically in how democratic republics fail and that our refusal to even talk about hitler simply feeds our intellectual laziness so the way to start the discussion about comparisons is to point out that americans are extremely lazy about history  i mean that s one way in which were definitely number one among major nations  and one of the ways we re lazy about history is that as soon as anyone suggests that the past might be useful  then we say  but wait it s not exactly the same and therefore i m just going to discard it   in that way in two or three seconds we give ourselves an excuse not to think about history source  business insiderhere s the video var playerparam     pcode      playerbrandingid      skin     config      player ooyala com static  stable latest skin plugin skin json     oo ready function    window pp   oo player create  container       playerparam             the main reason for studying history  other than the fact that it s fascinating as hell  is to learn from what our forebears got wrong as well as from what they got right  clearly  a hell of a lot went wrong during the late part of the  century and the first half of the  century  there were the robber barons  there was the great depression and there was the rise of fascism that killed millions of people  perhaps if we weren t so lazy about history  we wouldn t need to talk about income inequality and banks wouldn t be too big to fail  if mike godwin hadn t been so wildly misinterpreted  perhaps we would not have have been silenced when comparing trump s white nationalist following to that of hitler  instead  neo nazis are now an actual voting bloc and the nation s press secretary can conveniently ignore the fact that hitler gassed six million jews  hey  at least spicer is getting us to talk about history featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
