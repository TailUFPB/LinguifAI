one of the first things donald trump did after winning the presidential election was to completely crush decades of diplomatic policy with china  by accepting a phone call from the president of taiwan  at first  it seemed that china would let trump s blunder go and chalk it up to his political inexperience  however  when trump doubled down on his antics  china decided to fly a bomber into the south china sea in a show of force against trump  in order to let him know that the united states had better keep the  one china  policy   or else after this snafu  ned price  speaking for the obama white house s national security council  said  there is no change to our longstanding policy on cross strait issues  our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross strait relations  well  now  it seems that trump is going in that direction again  and is even entertaining the idea of taking a meeting with the taiwanese president  when reporters asked him about his plans for diplomatic relations in that direction and whether he d meet the president of taiwan  trump said   we ll see  he insists  however  that the united states will not have a rocky relationship with china under a trump administration  hopefully we re going to have great relationships with many countries   and that includes china  well  i got news for you  donald trump  if you keep flirting with recognizing taiwan  things with china are gonna go south really  really fast  diplomacy is important  as you will soon learn  some of these international relationships are tenuous at best  and one wrong move could cause the whole thing to come crashing down like a house of cards built on the softest bed of sand imaginable  now that you are the president elect  your words have consequences  don t go bandying about nuclear weapons and undoing years upon years of diplomatic norms  we ll all suffer the consequences if you do featured image via drew angerer getty images
