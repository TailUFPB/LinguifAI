on wednesday  senate democrats held a shadow hearing  to hear what the american people have to say about the gop health care bill  it was an emotional scene  with story after story about how much harm the american health care act will cause  after listening to one particularly heartbreaking story  sen  tim kaine was so moved that he was unable to hold back his tears i remember standing at the mailbox with my tiny baby   she was still under  pounds at  months old   cradled in my arms  and opening an envelope from the children s hospital with a bill inside for     more than my husband s annual salary  for merely  renting  the surgical room and equipment used during her heart surgery the month before  said cyndi johnson  a math teacher from bloomington  indiana johnson continued  explaining that before the affordable care act became the law of the land  the medical costs she found herself paying out of pocket for her baby were spiraling with no end in sight   in order to provide around the clock care for her daughter  johnson had to quit her job  but obamacare changed all that  she explained that if the aca hadn t removed the lifetime cap  her daughter would have reached it before her fifth birthday as a parent  absolutely nothing else matters when your child is sick   johnson said   your world shrinks and everything else just falls away  i would have sold my house  my car  done literally anything to keep my daughter healthy   and no family should have to make that horrible choice  all the senators had the hearing were moved by johnson s testimony  but tim kaine choke back his tears mrs  johnson  tears just started rolling down my face   kaine said   the people who passed this law couldn t care less what any of you think or what any of your experiences are  just think  instead of mike pence  who can t wait to snatch health care away from sick babies  we could have had tim kaine as our vice president  but  her emails featured image via justin sullivan getty images
