the second presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton sunday night was bizarre to say the least  donald lurked behind clinton onstage  lied and even threatened to jail the democratic presidential nominee  the debate occurred during donald s most recent scandal in which a tape was released showing trump casually discussing predatory behavior towards women  that issue was brought up during the debate  the lies  though  were abundant reporters for the new york times fact checked the statements made by clinton and  trump during the debate and the results are pretty damning for the gop presidential nominee the times rated the following statement by trump to be  just flat wrong     mr  trump said mrs  clinton has never used the phrase  radical islamic terrorism  in june  hillary clinton broke from president obama and used the term  radical islamism  to describe an attack on an orlando night club   whether you call it radical jihadism or radical islamism  i m happy to say either  i think they mean the same thing   she said on cnn in june but mrs  clinton and mr  obama have argued that using that term plays into the hands of the islamic state   we are not at war with islam   mrs  clinton said on sunday night hillary clinton  said that she had helped eight million children obtain health coverage  sept   responders receive medical care and children get safer medicines  she can back it up   the times notes lawmakers of both parties who led the fight for the children s health insurance program in  said then that hillary clinton had played a crucial behind the scenes role in lining up support for it she was a tenacious advocate for legislation that provided medical monitoring and treatment to emergency workers and cleanup workers at the site of the world trade center attacks  she was also a leading proponent of the pediatric research equity act of   which has increased the study of drugs in children after trump said clinton wants  amnesty for everybody  come on in  come on over   the times said that s  not her position  naturally  the benghazi attacks came up during the debate mr  trump said mrs  clinton ignored  requests for increased security from j  christopher stevens  the ambassador to libya  and communicated only with sidney blumenthal that little nugget was rated  extremely misleading  on trump s taxes  which he refuses to release mr  trump admitted that he used a   million loss declared on his  tax returns to avoid paying federal income taxes  but he refused to say how many years he paid no income tax and simultaneously claimed to have paid a  tremendous  amount of taxes the times responded to that with   more questions than answers  it s impossible to know exactly what donald j  trump has or has not done with regard to taxes  he s the only presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his tax returns  the   million loss declared on  tax returns obtained by the new york times could have allowed mr  trump to avoid legally paying income taxes for up to  years  there is evidence   the times reports to clinton saying trump supported the iraq war before it began while one statement by hillary was deemed  misleading   the lies told last night belong to donald j  trump   photo by scott olson via getty
