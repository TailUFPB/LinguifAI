the cornerstone of donald trump s presidential campaign can be summed up in just a few words  things suck and it s all obama s fault  for trump  this tweet pretty much optimizes his take on poverty our country does not feel  great already  to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty  violence and despair   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    was in response to president obama saying during the democratic national convention that  america is already great  so  who is correct  are americans trapped in a socioeconomic hell hole or are things far more optimistic  according to a study published by the new york times  things are vastly better for americans than they were when obama took office in  the article began by profiling alex caicedo of gaithersburg  md  a few years ago  caicedo was struggling with odd and part time jobs  he and his family were forced to live with his mother in law  today  he has a steady middle class job with benefits and the family is ready to move out of his mother in law s home  they are far from alone the caicedos are among the   million americans who were able to raise their chins above the poverty line last year  according to census data released this month  more than seven years after the recession ended  employers are finally being compelled to reach deeper into the pools of untapped labor  creating more jobs  especially among retailers  restaurants and hotels  and paying higher wages to attract workers and meet new minimum wage requirements what about the minorities  who  according to trump  have never had it worse  well  that s another trump lie  not only have minorities suffered much  much worse throughout history  slavery  jim crow   but they too have it dramatically better since obama took office poverty declined among every group  but african americans and hispanics  who account for more than  percent of those below the poverty line of    for a family of four in most states   experienced the largest improvement sorry  republicans  but you don t get an ounce of credit for the improvements  if anything  things would be much better if republicans weren t in office  the times credits social programs like social security and food stamps for keeping people out of poverty  they also credit the fall in oil prices for people being able to commute to their jobs  one major factor  and republicans will hate this  is that the increases in minimum wage are also taking people out of poverty after a long period of rising inequality  elise gould  an economist at the left leaning economic policy institute in washington  added  the benefits of the improving economy finally began to seep downward  wage increases were  even stronger at the bottom than in the middle   she said still  it s not enough   million americans still live in poverty  republicans have successfully blocked poor people from acquiring college degrees or job training that might help raise people out of poverty  for those without access to computers or the internet  finding a job can be burdensome  for those who can t afford cars  a job search can be impossible if this proves anything  it should be that it s time to continue successful democratic policies  not cut them off at the knees  as republicans would do featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
