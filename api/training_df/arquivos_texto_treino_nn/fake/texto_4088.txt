donald trump jr  tried in vain to brush off his dad s boasts of being able to sexually assault women  arguing that when men talk  these kinds of remarks are just  a fact of life  during an interview with kiro radio   on friday  junior said that men always say such lewd things about women as  grab  em by the pussy  and it is just an inevitability of life  obviously he s not happy about that  but i think we probably all know guys who have had conversations with other guys that go a little bit in that direction  that s a fact of life  trump jr  said  i think he s able to relate to ordinary americans because in many cases he is still very much like that  he does do that  he hasn t spent his whole life sitting there polishing every statement he s ever made  every conversation he s ever had   he added trump jr  started to say that his father  speaks from the heart  and then cut himself off  apparently realizing that this argument wasn t exactly helping the situation  he finally admitted that yes  his father s comments were a  mistake   but explained that all men who aren t politicians talk like this because the only reason you don t brag about sexual assault is to con people into voting for you  he speaks from the heart  that one is obviously one that we don t want to   that was a mistake  he recognizes that  he realizes it   but he s able to make a mistake because he hasn t spent his whole life just trying to be a politician  trump s campaign has been in a tailspin following the release of the  access hollywood tape that featured donald bragging about being able to sexually assault any woman he pleases thanks to his celebrity status  during the second presidential debate  he claimed that he had never actually done these kinds of things to a woman  but in the days that followed  at least ten women have stepped forward to accuse trump of doing to them exactly what he described on the bombshell tape featured image via ethan miller getty images
