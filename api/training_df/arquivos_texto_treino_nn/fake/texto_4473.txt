anyone watching monday night s highly charged presidential debate between hillary clinton and donald trump knows that hillary cleaned trump s clock  of course  trump s ego will never let him admit that he lost to hillary  so his surrogates are already being deployed all over the place to spin his embarrassingly terrible debate performance into something positive  the verbal gymnastics there are astounding  but of course these people are donald trump surrogates  so they are used to spinning faster than the head of the girl in the exorcist  one trump surrogate  former new york city mayor rudy giuliani  is taking things a step further  though  and trying to float the idea that trump should refuse to do future debates with hillary of course  this is just a cowardly move because of trump s abysmal performance  but giuliani is the trump spinner in chief  and instead decided to blame the fact that nbc moderator lester holt actually called trump out on his lies on his suggestion that trump should skip out next time  giuliani whined that holt s fact checking was unfair treatment of trump  and therefore if it were him  he wouldn t debate again without certain petty  childish demands being met  if i were donald trump  i wouldn t participate in another debate unless i was promised the journalist would act like a journalist  and not an ignorant fact check  my advice would be the moderator would have to promise they d be a moderator  when pressed  giuliani refused to say whether or not he would advise trump to find a way out of debating hillary again  only that if it were him  it is what he would do  this is in direct contrast with trump s campaign manager kellyanne conway  who insists trump will do both future debates while both candidates had nothing but good things to say about holt s moderation  giuliani lit into holt regarding the stop and frisk question  saying that the moderator s  interference regarding the controversial policy and its effects on new york city was  outrageous   however  considering that trump has floated the idea of a nationwide stop and frisk policy  the discussion on that subject and its racist implementation was perfectly reasonable  that didn t stop giuliani from outright lying in his rant  though  when he said  if journalism has ethics  lester holt unethically interfering in the area of law he knows nothing about  it is not unconstitutional and trump s description of that case was correct  but  again  this is a lie   a federal judge definitely ruled the policy unconstitutional at the end of the day  giuliani s tantrum is only because he wants his candidate to be able to lie with impunity in front of millions  because most trump voters are low information plebes  or they simply don t care about trump s bigotry  lies  incompetence  and just general all around douchebaggery  however  if he gets called out on a debate stage  it makes him look like a fool to undecided voters  who are much more likely to vote for hillary if they are going to leave third party camps if trump drops out of future debates  he and his surrogates will blame lester holt  the so called  liberal  media  and anyone and anything besides trump himself  rudy giuliani is just laying the groundwork for that right now featured image via alex wong getty images
