one of the craziest things about trump s russia fiasco is the fact that to defend his role model  russian president vladimir putin  trump has gone against multiple u s  intelligence agencies and all mounting evidence that russia did in fact meddle in the  election trump has continued to deny what has been widely accepted as facts by not only intelligence experts but members of his own republican party  even his own administration is publicly disagreeing with trump and stating that russia interfered with the election   and today  trump s un ambassador humiliated him on national television over his infamous denial in an interview with cnn  un ambassador nikki haley stated that  everybody knows  that russia messed around with the election  what she really should have said was  everyone but trump  haley said  everybody knows that russia meddled in our elections  everybody knows that they re not just meddling in the united states  election  they re doing this across multiple continents  and they re doing this in a way that they re trying to cause chaos within the countries  and it s not just going to be us saying this  i think you re going to hear other leaders come out and say  cut it out  we re not going to put up with it  you can watch haley pretty much agree that trump is a liar in the video below  everybody knows that russia meddled in our elections    nikkihaley tells  danabashcnn  cnnsotu https   t co   cnn   cnn  july    must not be keeping tabs on what her boss is actually saying  because just two days ago trump refused to say russia was involved in the election  the dishonest potus said  i think it could very well have been russia  but i think it could well have been other countries  i won t be specific  i think a lot of people interfere  i think it s been happening for a long time  when trump finds out that haley contradicted him  sh t is going to hit the fan  not only did haley blast trump  but she did it on his least favorite network  cnn  we won t be surprised if a twitter meltdown is soon to follow featured image via sean gallup    getty images
