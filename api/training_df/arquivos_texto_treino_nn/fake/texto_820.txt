donald trump is obsessed with the russia investigation  he has a right to be  after all  this is the modern day  cancer on the presidency  that richard nixon was warned about  and we all know what happened there  however  nixon knew how to keep his mouth shut  and trump definitely doesn t in a new interview with the new york times  trump rails against attorney general jeff sessions regarding sessions  decision to recuse himself from all things related to russia  of course  sessions really had no choice after it was revealed that he lied to the senate committee about his own meeting with the russian ambassador in order to get confirmed as attorney general  that matters not to trump  though  he says he would never have appointed sessions had he known there would be a recusal  trump told the times  jeff sessions takes the job  gets into the job  recuses himself  which frankly i think is very unfair to the president  how do you take a job and then recuse yourself  if he would have recused himself before the job  i would have said   thanks  jeff  but i m not going to take you   it s extremely unfair   and that s a mild word   to the president  here is audio of that clip newsflash  you  year old toddler  it is not jeff sessions  job to engage in an investigation in which he has a clear conflict of interest  further  had he done that with the intention of providing cover for you and your criminal family  he would be in legal trouble himself  jeff sessions is a lawyer  and he knew this  it seems that you literally expect your officials to risk losing law licenses or even going to jail over loyalty to you this administration is literally cannibalistic  the second anyone does anything that is even perceived as being harmful to trump  or  disloyal  as he likes to call it  they fall out of favor and trump starts threatening them i d be willing to bet that right about now  sessions is wishing he had never helped get trump elected  much less taken a job in his administration  in donald trump s world  the only person who is safe is donald trump himself featured image via shawn thew pool getty images
