kellyanne conway just got hammered with facts by cnn after she lied about why she wasn t on the network s sunday shows first  cnn rejected kellyanne conway for a day  now the network is considering a permanent ban the war between donald trump and cnn has escalated ever since inauguration day  trump has repeatedly called cnn  fake news  and his adviser kellyanne conway has only parroted this attack every time she appears on any media outlet to whine about the way networks are reporting on the administration it got to the point where trump even froze cnn out by declaring that he would not send any more surrogates to appear on cnn shows  so when trump offered to put conway on cnn on sunday  the network declined and got mike pence instead conway has repeatedly spread falsehoods and lies in defense of trump and has attacked the media coverage every time she makes an appearance on television  she even admitted that trump and his team lies by referring to those lies as  alternative facts   a phrase she has been taking a lot of heat for since she uttered it and her recent false story about a terrorist attack against bowling green  kentucky that never happened has also earned her criticism from journalists  and that s why cnn booted her from their shows on sunday according to the new york times some  like the new york university journalism professor jay rosen  were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her  and cnn declined to have her as a guest on sunday   in part because the trump administration offered her in lieu of vice president mike pence  but also because of what the network told me were  serious questions about her credibility  so now cnn could be the first network to ban kellyanne conway from the airwaves  and that s a good thing because if she is incapable of doing anything but lying and spreading false information  she definitely should not be given a platform to mislead people  on any network for that matter and their decision to ban her might pretty quickly since conway just outright lied about why she wasn t on cnn on sunday conway claimed that she wasn t rejected by cnn and that she wasn t on the shows because she had family commitments  she then proceeded to claim that she is scheduled to appear on cnn on monday and tuesday cnn quickly responded    kellyannepolls was offered to sotu on sunday by the white house  we passed  those are the facts   cnn communications   cnnpr  february    media outlets should follow cnn s lead  journalistic integrity and ethics demand that conway be removed before she does more damage  her misinformation and propaganda campaign may be tolerated by fox  but it should not be tolerated by real news outlets featured image via spencer platt getty images
