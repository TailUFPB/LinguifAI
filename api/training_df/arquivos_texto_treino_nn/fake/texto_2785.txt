trump has signed a stream of executive orders stripping federal funding from international  non governmental health organizations that so much as mention abortion  authorizing a gigantic wall to keep brown people out of our country to create a gigantic  safe space  for his racist followers and authorizing concentration camps in which to keep the millions of immigrants he rounds up  and   in a move that literally mobilized the world against him   enacting a partial ban on muslims entering the united states  including dual citizens  legal permanent residents  students  people with jobs  and others he considers dangerous even the most casual observer can see that donald trump s horrific policies are doing nothing but creating a destabilized environment not only in the united states  but worldwide   on sunday  senators john mccain and lindsey graham released a joint statement warning that trump s muslim ban is a  self inflicted wound  in the fight against terrorism  our most important allies in the fight against isil are the vast majority of muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred   the senators said   executive order sends a signal  intended or not  that america does not want muslims coming into our country  that is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security  we should not stop green card holders from returning to the country they call home  we should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help   the senators  added  and we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation  and who have suffered unspeakable horrors  most of them women and children  trump could take this message to heart  pausing for a glorious moment of self reflection  and apologize to the world for his actions  he could fire the white supremacists  kremlin cronies  and imbeciles with which he has stacked his cabinet and replace them with people who will work for the good of the country  once and for all cementing himself as a true legend among world leaders  trump could apologize to the muslim community   but that s just not the guy he is in a statement on twitter  which is apparently where the president releases important information now  trump responded to the senators  condemnation of his bigoted executive order  which was literally written by a white supremacist  by informing the world that mccain and graham are trying to  start world war iii  by saying that we shouldn t ban muslims from our country the joint statement of former presidential candidates john mccain   lindsey graham is wrong   they are sadly weak on immigration  the two  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    senators should focus their energies on isis  illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start
