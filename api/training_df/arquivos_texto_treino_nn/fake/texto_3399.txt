trump s current national security adviser  general michael flynn  is already in some serious hot water over his mishandling of classified info  you know  the stuff that republicans insist hillary should be punished for   the washington post actually first broke this story via official documents from the u s  army  but  of course  flynn s son wasn t having it flynn  jr   also jumped on the increasingly meaningless  fake news  bandwagon to try and disparage the post s findings  flynn s tweets are protected  however  both the wrap and the daily dot obtained a copy  his tweet read  another article by the failing fake news that is the compost  should they continue to operate when they continue to get everything so wrong  compost   he thinks he s funny  that s cute  flynn  jr   stands by his father s integrity  or lack thereof  even when he s the one putting forth  fake news   what he failed to realize is that the link in his tweet goes straight to those army documents  not to the post s story nice job shooting yourself in the foot there  junior lachlan markay  of the free beacon  and formerly of the not at all liberal heritage foundation  shows how the younger flynn has to eat his own words by pointing out the glaring mistake out for all to see mike  this link goes to internal us army documents  not a news article https   t co   lachlan markay   lachlan  december    seems that the term  fake news  only refers to  news that disagrees with a person s already established narrative   rather than  made up facts and stories   like it did when it referred to the true fake news stories out of macedonia  and from conspiracy sites flynn  jr  was actually fired from trump s transition team after he pushed the pizzagate conspiracy theory  if that s what he was really fired for  then it shows a modicum of sense  but the fact that he was even on the team at all actually underscores the conspiracy theorist nature of donald trump and the people he s willing to work with only people who hate that the press is actually uncovering bad things would consider the washington post to be  fake news   trump is appointing people to his cabinet that have no clue what they re doing  and can t be bothered to do even the minutest bit of research into anything  just like cheetolini himself featured image via alex wong getty images
