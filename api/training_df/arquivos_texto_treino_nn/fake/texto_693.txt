after the teeny tiny tenure of anthony  the mooch  scaramucci  the gates of hell have opened  now that we ve had a foul mouthed sopranos extra leading the communications team  even if ever so briefly   pretty much anything goes when it comes to trump s performance art installation previously known as the white house why should it surprise anyone that the poster child for corporate greed and everything everyone hates about millennials   pharma bro  martin shkreli  now wants scaramucci s job  oh  and did i mention that shkreli is currently on trial for federal securities fraud  score while shkreli hasn t yet appeared to make an official pitch for the job  on monday  he posted this rather cryptic message on facebook   in for comms director  some thought it was a completely appropriate idea this might be a little premature  though  even by trump standards  the man who s been dubbed  the most hated man in america  for price gouging aids patients with a   percent price increase for a drug commonly used to treat aids  could be headed to prison  but not for that  he has been accused of defrauding half a dozen investors about the size and performance of his hedge funds  and how well qualified he was to manage them  he was also accused of using his pharmaceuticals company  retrophin  as a  piggy bank  to pay investors back and cover personal debt source  independentif found guilty  he could face up to  years in prison  if found not guilty  he could be a natural as the face of the white house  according to a former co worker  shkreli shares some of the same  um  personality quirks as blotus a former co worker  caroline stewart  testified that he was a  scam artist  and  mentally unstable   one of his hedge funds imploded after a short trade failed and he ended up owing bank of america merrill lynch   million and as with dear orange leader  shkreli suffers from a persecution complex which he defends with accusations of a  witch hunt  do you think he could be the communications director from prison featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
