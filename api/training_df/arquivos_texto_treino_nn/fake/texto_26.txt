ronald reagan is largely seen as the messiah of the republican party  despite how long it has been since the man was president  he has always remained the high standard of gop morality for potential office holders  that is  until now  reagan is likely rolling over in his grave at the idea of the state of his party with donald trump as its standard bearer  and he s likely doing the same at the prospect of a bigoted accused child molester like roy moore  r al  being the next gop senator from alabama  well  now reagan has another reason to hate moore  he s clearly in the pocket of russian autocrat vladimir putin just like donald trump is during an interview where he s talking about americans being the face of  evil  in the world right now  moore indicates that putin s harsh and murderous treatment of lgbtq people in russia is something he would like to see happen in the united states  then  he does something most appalling  and goes on to give putin a message in russian  now  no one knows where a bigoted  backwoods buffoon like roy moore would learn russian  after all  he s barely left alabama  where he has spent the last   years wreacking havoc and just basically cementing alabama s place as america s bigoted boil on the butt of humanity wherever and whenever he can  however  he managed to learn enough russian to dog whistle to putin in that interview  that should disturb us all  not only is the man being a homophobe  a racist  a misogynist  and more than likely a child molester  he s also a russian stooge america  we can do better  we have enough russian puppets at the highest levels of government  lord knows we don t need one in the united states senate watch the appalling video below please watch this until the end  roy moore sides with putin over reagan  says that america is the focus of evil in the world  and sends a nice message to putin in russian  pic twitter com wfgdkvzeht  the reagan battalion   reaganbattalion  december    image via drew angerer getty images
