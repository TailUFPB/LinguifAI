with no one wanting to perform for donald trump at the inauguration  people are now people forced to perform  and the people being forced to perform are the legendary radio city rockettes  they are contractually obligated to perform in fact  the rockettes union is calling any form of boycott of the event  invalid  according to broadwayworld broadwayworld has obtained and confirmed the authenticity of an email sent from the american guild of variety artists to what appears to be rockettes in its membership as a response to the announcement that some rockettes do not want to participate in the inauguration of president elect donald trump the email reads   we have received an email from a rockette expressing concern about getting  involved in a dangerous political climate  but i must remind you that you are all employees  and as a company  mr  dolan obviously wants the rockettes to be represented at our country s presidential inauguration  as they were in      any talk of boycotting this event is invalid  i m afraid  everyone is entitled to her own political beliefs  but there is no room for this in the workplace  the email continues in bolded  underlined font   if you are not full time  you do not have to sign up to do this work  if you are full time  you are obligated  doing the best performance to reflect an american institution which has been here for over  years is your job  i hope this pulls into focus the bottom line on this work  the rockettes aren t taking this sitting down  rockette phoebe pearl wrote on instagram  i usually don t use social media to make a political stand but i feel overwhelmed with emotion  finding out that it has been decided for us that rockettes will be performing at the presidential inauguration makes me feel embarrassed and disappointed  the women i work with are intelligent and are full of love and the decision of performing for a man that stands for everything we re against is appalling  i am speaking for just myself but please know that after we found out this news  we have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts  we will not be forced   notmypresident however  they are still being forced  and it is not okay  donald trump has been shown on tape to admitting to sexually assaulting women by forcing himself on them sexually  and insinuating it s fine because he s famous  now  in a weird and disgusting parallel  these female performers are once again being forced to do something for trump against their will at risk of losing their jobs  it s horrifically befitting but you can stand up for them by contacting their union and letting them know that these women shouldn t be forced to do anything they re uncomfortable with here s the contact info   rockettes being contractually forced into performing at the sexual predator s inauguration   agva threatening to fire and or sue if not  pic twitter com   kevin clamato   kevinclamato  december    s not the fault of these women that no one wants to perform for trump  so they had to go and find performers who are contractually obligated  they shouldn t have to fear losing their jobs because they don t want to perform for a person as vile as trump featured photo by isaac brekken  drew angerer getty images
