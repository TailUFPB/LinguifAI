it s beginning  while some dismissed donald trump s campaign promises to ban muslims from entering the country  dismantle our country s healthcare  build a giant goddamn motherfucking wall to keep brown people from entering the country  and every other horrific thing you can think of and more as  just words  he was using to get stupid people to vote for him  he meant every single one of them   and he s been proving it one of president asterisk s first acts was an executive order that is the beginning of his efforts to dismantle obamacare  he followed up by signing away our environment and authorizing the building of two controversial pipelines  stripping federal funds from international health organizations that so much as mention abortion  in an order conveniently following millions of women lining the streets to protest him   he then withdrew us from a major trade agreement without a single thought about the repercussions  began funneling our tax dollars into his stupid wall  ordered a weekly report on crimes committed by  aliens  and banned muslims from seven countries he hates from entering the country trump even authorized the building of new camps in which undocumented immigrants could be concentrated   for a limited time  of course   until they could be deported  i feel like there s a term for these things  but i can t quite place it   the washington post reports  the presidential directives signed wednesday aim to create more detention centers  add thousands of border patrol agents and withhold federal funds from what are known as sanctuary cities  which do not comply with federal immigration laws  one order calls for the  immediate construction of a physical wall  in short  if you re a member of this group that trump considers undesirable  you ll be sent to one of these camps and any city that might otherwise harbor you will face extreme penalties for doing so  we are going to restore the rule of law in the united states   trump told a crowd of dhs employees wednesday   beginning today  the united states gets control of its borders  trump also vowed to investigate alleged voter fraud in blue states   particularly in  urban   that s right wing slang for  black   areas   so he can prove once and forgodamnall that he actually won the popular vote  because he really is that petty it hasn t even been a week since trump took office and he has already made it clear that he has declared war on the american people  the question remains  just how much are we going to take of this bullshit make no mistake about it  people will die in trump s camps and his supporters will applaud this  is  not  ok featured image via getty images  pool
