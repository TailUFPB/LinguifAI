someone finally asked kellyanne conway how she can look herself in the mirror every morning and work for donald trump during an event sponsored by the university of virginia s center for politics  high school student maaike laanstra corn asked conway how she can  rationalize  working for trump even after he bragged about grabbing women  by the p ssy  and has been hit with multiple accusations of sexual assault rather than just own up that she s a disgrace to the female gender and a terrible human being who sold her soul to satan  conway whined about the question and scolded the student instead  women are tired of the same argument and the same thing you are presenting to me right now   conway claimed according to the hill  i m glad that people looked at  and said   you know what  that s an argument that will not create a single job in my community  not bring back a single of the   factories that have been closed  will not deter one member of isis from doing their bloodletting here or anywhere else in the world  in other words  conway completely ignored that fact that her boss is a creep who sexually assaults women and gets away with it  and then conway scolded her for asking a legitimate question  for you to use sexual assault to try to make news here i think is unfortunate  but it also doesn t matter because donald trump promised he ll be a president of all americans  yeah   all americans  who aren t black  latino  muslim  or female conway had a chance to give a serious answer to a serious question  donald trump s treatment of women should be taken seriously  not brushed off as irrelevant but once again  conway defended her boss by attacking a woman  something she constantly did during the campaign whether it was hillary clinton or all the women who came forward with their stories of how trump violated them she should have trouble sleeping at night featured image via screenshot
