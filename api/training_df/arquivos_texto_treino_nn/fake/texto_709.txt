donald trump becomes more unhinged by the day  the week we just witnessed is his craziest yet  first  there was the hyper partisan  free wheeling speech he gave to a bunch of children at the boy scouts  jamboree  the speech outraged so many people that the boy scouts of america had to apologize  then  while speaking in front of police officers in long island  new york  trump openly endorsed and encouraged police brutality in a racist speech sure to fire up his mouthbreathing base  and of course  there was the ouster of white house chief of staff reince priebus via twitter  who he humiliated as he was pushed out the door  to top it all off  he called for banning transgender soldiers from the military without even telling the pentagon and the joint chiefs of staff first  this major  sweeping policy change was also made via twitter through all of this madness  there were  of course  trump s repeated and sustained attacks on his own attorney general  jeff sessions  even though this should have republicans reeling with outrage  and some capitol hill republicans have fired warning shots at trump about sessions  there is one person who has been suspiciously silent throughout the chaos  mike pence  trump s second in command well  rep  maxine waters  d ca  thinks she knows the reason for that  taking to twitter on saturday evening  rep  waters said what anyone watching is likely thinking  pence is just riding out the trump insanity until the republicans on capitol hill finally decide they ve had enough  and they pull the trigger on trump  this  of course  would make pence president  here is that tweet mike pence is somewhere planning an inauguration  priebus and spicer will lead the transition   maxine waters   maxinewaters  july     waters is likely right  there s no way establishment republicans like mike pence actually like living with donald trump as president  he is  and always has been  nothing more than a vehicle to put them in power  and honestly  because of the chaos  trump has exactly zero legislative achievements  sure  jeff sessions is doing awful things from the doj  but those horrific policies can be promptly reversed once a new administration arrives  trump is ignorant  incompetent  and crazy  pence  however  is much more dangerous  i can t believe i m saying this  but i truly hope rep  waters  predictions never come to pass  america will be an evangelical theocracy in no time under pence in short  either way  america  we re screwed featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
