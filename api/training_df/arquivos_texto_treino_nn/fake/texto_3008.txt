donald trump may be decrying the documents dumped by buzzfeed as  fake news   but it seems to be  fake news  everyone can believe in  ever since the memos compiled by former  officer christopher steele were released to the public  the donald has not exactly had an easy time of things  with every press conference and attempt to tweet quickly devolving into a screaming mess in which trump throws himself into a panic screaming of all caps typing the words  fake news  but while trump is taking the  nothing to see here  approach with the reports  at least four sources now back the information according to a report from bbc s paul wood earlier this week  the former  agent is not the only source for the claim about russian kompromat on the president elect  back in august  a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by  the head of an east european intelligence agency   wood says  explaining that he used an intermediary to check into things  a u s  intelligence contact told him that there was  more than one  tape  and that video and audio of trump s exploits in moscow and st  petersberg do exist according to israeli news publication yedioth ahronoth  their country s spies have been warned by the united states against sharing information with the trump administration until they can determine whether he has been compromised by putin these fears  which began upon trump s election  grew stronger following a meeting held recently between israeli and american intelligence officials  the date of the meeting is not mentioned to protect the sources of the report   during the meeting  according to the israelis who participated in it  their american colleagues voiced despair over trump s election  as he often lashes out at the american intelligence community  the american officials also told the israelis that the national security agency  nsa  had  highly credible information  that russia s intelligence agencies  the fsb and gru  were responsible for hacking the democratic party  dnc  servers during the elections and leaking sensitive information to wikileaks  which hurt democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton the american officials further added that they believed russia president vladimir putin had  leverages of pressure  over trump   but did not elaborate  they were apparently referring to what was published wednesday about embarrassing information collected by the russian intelligence in a bid to blackmail the president elect the americans implied that their israeli colleagues should  be careful  as of january   trump s inauguration date  when transferring intelligence information to the white house and to the national security council  nsc   which is subject to the president  according to the israelis who were present in the meeting  the americans recommended that until it is made clear that trump is not inappropriately connected to russia and is not being extorted   israel should avoid revealing sensitive sources to administration officials for fear the information would reach the iranians if israel s secrets are indeed not kept confidential  this is a serious danger to the state s national security  since the early   the cooperation between the israel and us intelligence communities has been intensified  it was led by the head of the israeli military intelligence directorate  aman  at the time  aharon ze evi farkash  who even received a citation from the nsa chief general michael hayden   late mossad chief meir dagan and his successor  tamir pardo  who served earlier as the commander of one of the secret operational units that cooperated with the americans  the israelis who attended the meeting said that the americans advised them not to expose any sensitive sources to members of the trump administration  lest that information reach iranian hands  until it becomes clear that trump does not have a compromised relationship with russia and is not vulnerable to extortion   the report states at this point  we have no choice but to assume that the level of concern shown by intelligence agencies worldwide is a strong indicator that we should be concerned too  donald trump is sworn into office on friday  may one of the gods help us all featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla
