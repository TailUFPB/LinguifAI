donald trump tried to take credit for fiat chrysler s announcement that they will be creating   jobs in the united states  fiat chrysler called out his bullshit on monday morning  trump posted on twitter that fiat chrysler announced the creation of   jobs and a   billion investment in new factories in michigan and ohio and appeared to suggest that he is responsible for making it happen it s finally happening   fiat chrysler just announced plans to invest   in michigan and ohio plants  adding  jobs  this after  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    said last week that it will expand in michigan and u s  instead of building a billion dollar plant in mexico  thank you ford   fiat c   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    as usual  trump is trying to make himself look like a middle class hero by taking credit for something that he had nothing to do with as it turns out  fiat chrysler had this plan in the works long before election day when they announced it a year ago because they noticed a demand for more trucks and suvs in the united states according to thinkprogress the company started following through in july of last year  it announced at that time that it would invest more than   billion in plants in illinois and ohio  adding new   jobs  and    billion in a michigan plant  adding  jobs monday s announcement  therefore  is the second phase in this process and a confirmation of these ongoing plans   onsistent and combined with previously announced investments   as the company put it  this plan was in the works back in    jodi tinson  a spokeswoman for fca  told thinkprogress   this announcement was just final confirmation  when asked directly if it was true that politics and the election had no influence on the announcement  she said   correct  furthermore  if any president can take credit for this it s president obama  who oversaw the bailout of the u s  auto industry that included fiat teaming up with the united auto workers and both the canadian and american government to co own chrysler to rescue the company after it declared bankruptcy in  since then  fiat built the company back up and bought out the uaw and u s  canadian partners to gain sole ownership in  after investing    billion in american facilities while creating   jobs since  so trump is taking credit for an accomplishment by fiat that was made possible under president obama s guidance and leadership at a time when the auto industry in this country was set to collapse because of economic policies republicans had pursued for decades  the same policies trump wants to bring back and you can bet that trump won t be taking credit when industries start to fail under his incompetent administration  he ll be blaming everyone and anything but himself as usual featured image  steve pope getty images
