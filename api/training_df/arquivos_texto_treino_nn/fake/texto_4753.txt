on monday  donald trump gave interviews to reporters on his plane  and naturally the subject of the presidential debates against democratic nominee hillary clinton came up  as expected  trump s responses were nothing short of moronic and unbelievable  and show just how unprepared trump is to be president as reporters threw different questions at trump about his strategy to beat clinton  trump gave responses that should have his supporters worried sick about how he s going to win  trump told reporters that he is barely doing any debate prep   in stark contrast to most presidential candidates  with a dismissive attitude  the ignorant business mogul revealed that he has not planned on mock debates  saying he d pretty much rather wing it  i ve seen people do so much prep work when they get out there  they can t speak  i ve seen that  then when trump was asked if he d actually follow through with the debates  trump gave an even more surprising answer trump said   as of this moment  yeah    a strange response for sure  and then he said that only hurricanes and natural disasters  would stop him from debating the former secretary of state  he said  i expect to do all three  i look forward to the debates  you can watch this bizarre interview below hilariously  trump also said that it was his  obligation  to debate clinton and that presidential debates are an  important element of what we re doing   he said  i did them with the other  you know  the other cases  we had  i guess  debates  obviously  i did well in the debates  obviously  according to the polls  the online polls they did right after the debates  and i think i m doing the same thing  trump must have forgotten that he actually skipped one of the gop debates  and also backed out of the debate that he challenged vermont senator bernie sanders to  and there are ongoing rumors that trump is going to somehow find an excuse to back out of his debates with clinton as well  judging from this interview alone  we would not be surprised featured image is a screenshot
