well  sad to say  it s a sure chance the next president of our beloved united states of america is going to be donald trump  it s disappointing to say the least that our country could actually elect a man like him  however  the electoral college has mostly spoken  and there s not much we can do at this point now  the people of america who voted against trump are trying to escape as they realize all they have done was in vain  by escape i mean  they are fleeing to canada  in such large quantities that they have successfully caused canada s immigration to crash  that s right  even with unofficial results in  they know something s gotta give the best part is this isn t the first time canada s website crashed from desperate americans  during super tuesday the site crashed  and also the google search for  move to canada  spiked significantly  now  canada has a reputation for being nice  so nice that they responded with an advertisement   test drive canada   isn t that something it s not a big surprise that those who despise mr  trump would look toward our friendly northern neighbours  after all  they have great healthcare  welfare  friendly to obama  and don t forget the maple syrup  what s not to love  just one little problem with everyone leaving though  the less people here in america who still stand against trump the more he can do what he wants with our country  some of us want to stay here and thwart our new orange president every chance we get  the less of us here to do so  well  the less he ll be thwarted  so for the love of america  as tempting as it might be  don t leave  stay here  stand together  and let s all say  screw you  trump   together  it looks like he lost the popular vote  so the fact is   the people  didn t vote for him photo by chip somodevilla getty images
