with just three days until election day  hillary clinton just dropped a bombshell reminding us why donald trump is totally unfit to be president the list could go on and on but hillary and her team settled on just  things the republican nominee has said and done that would disqualify anyone else in a normal election as we all know  trump has been saying offensive things since the first day of his campaign when he called mexicans  rapists   which is number  on the list  this list  which includes citations  is so long that it missed many other offensive things trump has said and done here are just a few of the items listed  spent five years refusing to admit that president obama was born in the u s  and still hasn t apologized  said that wages in america are already  too high   encouraged a foreign country to commit espionage in the u s   calling on russia to hack hillary clinton s emails  refused to disavow white supremacist david duke and the ku klux klan four times in one interview  confused the kurds  a crucial partner in the middle east  with the quds iranian revolutionary guards  didn t know the difference between hezbollah and hamas  had no idea that russia already invaded ukraine in   promising that russia is  not going to go into ukraine  all right  you can mark it down   bragged about his building becoming the tallest in lower manhattan after the collapse of the world trade center on september     said it would be totally fine if we defaulted because  if the economy crashed  you could make a deal   regularly praises and defends vladimir putin as a  leader  who is  getting an  a    and has even described him more favorably than president obama  launched a series of attacks on a federal judge that paul ryan referred to as  textbook  racism  saying it was  common sense  that the judge  who was born in indiana  would be biased because of his  mexican heritage   compared his sacrifices of working  very  very hard  and  buil great structures to the sacrifices of a gold star family  suggested there needed to be  some form of punishment  to women who get abortions  kicked a baby out of one of his rallies  seriously  complimented north korea s dictator  kim jong un   you ve gotta give him credit    he goes in  he takes over  he s the boss  it s incredible   faced over   lawsuits  largely from ordinary americans and small business owners who he refused to pay in spite of promises to the contrary  said  in   that he was rooting for the real estate market to collapse  because  people like me would go in and buy  and  you can make a lot of money   said veterans suffering from post traumatic stress are not  strong  and  can t handle  war and these are just the tip of the iceberg  to read the entire list  click here as demonstrated perfectly by hillary clinton  donald trump should have been disqualified from running for president on the first day of his campaign  he is offensive  he is hateful  he is sexist  he is a racist  and he is a liar who is more interested in helping himself than he is in helping the american people if he somehow wins this election it will be the most disastrous election this country has ever produced and it will be an embarrassment that ruins our reputation and image around the globe hillary is right to point out that in any other election year any of these remarks would end a candidate s campaign  but donald trump has conned his deplorables into supporting him no matter what he says or does  as the number one thing on this list noted  trump has said he  could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and   wouldn t lose any voters  one wonders what they ll let him get away with if he gets to be in the white house featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
