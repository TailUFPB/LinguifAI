on tuesday  it was announced that donald trump has elected to keep james comey  that nice gentleman who helped swing the election in trump s favor by sending republicans a letter falsely indicating that a new investigation into hillary clinton was being opened just before the election  as fbi director  that s a move the new york times notes will  keep mr  comey at the center of the f b i  s investigation into several trump associates and their potential ties with the russian government  comey demonstrated with his attacks on hillary that he has absolutely no integrity whatsoever  which makes him exactly the sort of guy trump would want to keep around  also on tuesday  purely by coincidence of course  news broke that trump s national security adviser was cleared of any wrongdoing in his frantic communications with russian ambassador sergey kislyak on the same day president obama announced sanctions against russia for their cyberattack on our nation during the election white house press secretary sean spicer  who also says that trump had the most heavily witnessed inauguration in history  and for whom kellyanne conway created a new term   alternative facts   in an effort to normalize his lies  explained monday that the two aren t in frequent contact but have spoken recently on a number of issues that were completely innocent  like logistics for a post inauguration call between trump and his russian dictator friend who  intelligence agencies say directly interfered with our election on the donald s behalf the problem here is that americans cannot be sure if the presented results are legitimate  as the fbi is headed by someone who went out of his way  breaking precedent and probably the law  to aid trump in the election with misleading information about clinton  this same man was just rewarded for his actions when trump allowed him to keep his job  but trump also has the power to fire him if he isn t satisfied with the results of any of the numerous investigations into his team in november  trump said that comey  made a mistake  when he announced that hillary clinton had committed no crimes and would not be charged  but  brought back his reputation  when he released the letter that gave right wing propaganda outlets  and putin s team of propagandists  much needed ammo just before the election so now  we as americans are presented with a dilemma  do we accept the words of the fbi  knowing that trump can fire the person in charge of the investigations  when he is someone who has shown a corrupt desire to interfere in important things like elections in the past  or do we demand a full release of investigatory documents and transcripts just to be sure the truth is being told probably better to be safe about this featured image by andrew harrer via getty images
