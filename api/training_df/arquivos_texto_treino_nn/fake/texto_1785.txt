a local news station in boston has had it with the fox brand damaging their own reputation  wfxt channel  is going to change the name of its newscast to boston  news removing  fox  entirely following a drop in its ratings and a study that showed their audience saw the newscast as  leaning conservative  fox news itself has some ridiculous shows  like fox   friends and the o reilly factor  both of which tend to peddle not just misleading information  but also the very attitudes that make things worse  not better  in this country  for instance  on fox   friends this morning  brian kilmeade whined about conditions in immigration detention centers  but he wasn t talking about the stunning human rights abuses  he s upset about this  get this  they re enjoying seven hours of outdoor activity  who gets that anymore  fresh sheets  and absolutely   i don t get that  no need to learn english  co host ainsley earhardt added  seven hours of outdoor activity  freshly washed sheets  and absolutely no need to learn english  that s the easy life of an illegal immigrant inside american jails  or clean sheets have something to do with basic sanitation  but hey  they ll think what they want here  the outdoor activity   it s not like they re in some eden like garden of paradise there s also the whole controversy with bill o reilly and sexual harassment  and fox news  failure to deal with their male employees who engage in such behavior  billo the clown is still on the air  and so far  fox doesn t seem to have done much about it who wants to be associated with this crapola  wfxt is actually owned by cox media group and not fox news  but they re still considered a fox affiliate and the brand carries a reputation that is increasingly negative  massachusetts is a deep blue state  and their businesses and media outlets need to act accordingly to continue reaching their audiences this decision is actually a few years in the making   it didn t just happen  wfxt s news director  mike oliveria  said that massachusetts viewers want unbiased news  fox news is decidedly not unbiased  but wfxt strives to be  as do most local newscasts  he said  it s not that  a bad brand  it s just that it s not ours  while other fox affiliates under cox media s umbrella aren t considering dropping  fox  from their names at this time  we have t wonder if that s going to change featured image by spencer platt via getty images
