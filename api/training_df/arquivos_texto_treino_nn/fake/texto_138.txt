donald trump may think it s perfectly fine for him to say and tweet about anything and everything  including his outrage over the fbi s russia investigation  but in truth  it s not  and robert mueller could actually do something about it if he feels the complicit orange one is interfering  former watergate prosecutor nick akerman said  this could be grounds for mueller to obtain a gag order on trump  it would be unprecedented  but he is interfering with the government s right to a fair trial  akerman was responding to trump s decision to blast george papadopoulos  who tried to arrange meetings between trump campaign officials and russian officials  including between putin and trump   and is now working with the fbi as a cooperating witness  trump called him a  low level volunteer  who had  already proven to be a liar   in his typically pathetic attempt to distance himself from those who are incriminating to him he then repeated his calls for the department of justice to investigate hillary clinton  the democrats  and basically anybody who isn t him or has anything to do with him  his calls for the doj to investigate people who ve pissed him off has drawn widespread criticism from legal professionals and analysts the fake president is also upset with the fact that he can t control what the doj does  he doesn t want an independent justice department   he wants a department that will go after who he tells them to go after  the saddest thing is  because i am the president of the united states  i am not supposed to be involved with the justice department  i m not supposed to be involved with the fbi  i m not supposed to be doing the kind of things i would love to be doing and i am very frustrated by it it s very discouraging to me  i ll be honest  i m very unhappy with it  that the justice department isn t going   maybe they are  but you know  as president   and i think you understand this   as a president you re not supposed to be involved in that process  he ll be even less happy under a gag order from mueller  too bad for him if mueller actually decides to do it featured image via alex wong and win mcnamee getty images
