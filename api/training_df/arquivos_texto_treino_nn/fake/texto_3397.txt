donald trump has long had a contentious relationship with the press  he cannot stand to be criticized  and any publication that dares to do so risks his ire  he banned a long list of publications from his campaign rallies  and now that he has been elected  he continues to attack the fourth estate  trump s latest target is vanity fair  and the reason could not be more petty apparently  one of the magazine s writers  tina nguyen  wrote a scathing article criticizing the quality of trump grill  which is an eatery in trump tower  nguyen says of the place  the allure of trump s restaurant  like the candidate  is that it seems like a cheap version of rich  nguyen also goes on to say that trump grill s quality  reveals everything you need to know about our next president  of course  one of the things that sticks in trump s craw the most is anyone questioning his wealth  or his status among the elite  there are many people who believe that trump is not a billionaire at all  and that if only he would release his tax returns  we d see a man who knows nothing of finances and money  who is a tax cheat  as well as a cheapskate who donates nothing to charitable causes like most truly wealthy people do the article provoked a thinly veiled threat against vanity fair  as trump insisted the magazine was in  big trouble  has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of  vanityfair magazine  way down  big trouble  dead  graydon carter  no talent  will be out   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    course  the mention of editor graydon carter is telling as well  as to trump s ability to hold long and enduring grudges  carter is  after all  the one who dubbed trump the  short fingered vulgarian   and it is a moniker that is appropriate and has stuck  that s why the gop primaries devolved into dirty jokes regarding hand sizes  of course  this speaks to trump s insecurity about his own masculinity  which is something else that trump cannot stand to have challenged all in all  this is part of a much deeper and more troubling pattern  though  trump is directly attacking the first amendment  and it does not bode well to have a president who is so hostile to the press  he has already done a remarkable job of making his supporters blindly believe that the press hates them  that they are out to get them and their chosen king  now  trump s direct attacks on the press and specific publications means that he will likely use the bully pulpit of the white house to do the same for the next four years this is how autocracies start  folks  look for trump to try to set up some kind of state funded propaganda network  similar to what they have in russia  to drive the message he wants and to shut out all other voices  this will likely start in the form of breitbart news  which will then morph into some kind of television network on behalf of the trump administration these are scary times  folks  remember   we must resist  we can no longer count on the institutions we ve long taken for granted to prevent the slow formation of a dictatorship  in fact  if you look closely  it s already happening featured image via drew angerer getty images
