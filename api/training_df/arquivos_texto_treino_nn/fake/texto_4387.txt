remember  this is the same guy who has been going around calling iran one of our greatest enemies  it turns out he seemed to have no problem aiding one of their biggest banks that also happens to be linked to terrorism recent reports reveal that donald trump was being paid half a million dollars in yearly rent between  and  by bank melli  the iranian bank that not only aided iran in obtaining materials for their nuclear program but also funneled   million to the quds force unit of the iranian revolutionary guard  which supports acts of terrorism accepting rent payments from this bank may have violated the u s  embargo that had been slapped on iran at the time  which means donald trump is a serial violator of embargoes placed on enemy nations just last week  trump was outed by newsweek for violating the cuban embargo in   which is the same year he bought the general motors building in manhattan and began accepting rent payments from the iranian bank former state department official richard nephew  who helped both president bush and president obama hit iran with sanctions has a big problem with trump renting office space to an iranian bank that helps fund act of terrorism  it s a pretty hypocritical position to take   he said   it suggests that his principles are pretty flexible when it comes to him getting paid  should someone in america have known better than to do business with iran  yeah  indeed  donald trump has been a hardliner when it comes to iran  but apparently that is only when it comes to the campaign trail  in reality  trump doesn t mind working with dictators or dirty banks linked to terrorism as long as he can line his pockets this should seriously be enough to end trump s quest for the presidency  clearly  he is only running to help himself  as nephew said  trump could easily choose money over principles when it comes to negotiating with hostile foreign nations  that s dangerous for our security and our reputation around the world  when donald trump says he can negotiate better deals with russia  iran  and china  he only means that he can negotiate better deals for himself and his own piggy bank  the last thing this country needs is a president who can be bought by our enemies featured image via drew angerer getty images
