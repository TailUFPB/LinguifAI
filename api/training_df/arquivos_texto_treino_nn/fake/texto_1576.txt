ellen degeneres  perhaps more than anyone  has shown average americans that lgbt people are just like other people  only in her case  a lot funnier  a better dancer and a lot nicer  she s so nice that she rarely weighs into political issues  so for liberals  it was refreshing when she told matt lauer of the today show that she would never have trump on her show because  he s against everything that  she  stand s  for  the daytime talkshow host has interviewed numerous politicians on her show  including barack and michelle obama  bernie sanders and even george w  bush  obama even awarded her the presidential medal of freedom  but for trump  she says   i m not going to change his mind   and that kills it for her  we need to look at someone else who looks different than us and believes in something that we don t believe in and still accept them  and still let them have their rights  it s not really personal for degeneres  who said she s met trump and never had a problem with him until he began running for president  i flew in his helicopter and did a bit with him  so i knew him then   she told lauer  i have not spoken to him since he s run for president or become president   she said here s the video degeneres came out  years ago  since then  she has gained mainstream acceptance and there s little doubt that her show and her persona have helped change americans  views on lgbt rights she doesn t get political too often  but this isn t the first time she has spoken out against trump  degeneres was the voice of dory in the animated pixar film finding dory  after trump s inauguration  she noted that there were similarities between dory and trump s proposed border wall  now  of course finding dory is about a fish named dory   degeneres said in front of a monitor displaying stills from the film   and  dory lives in australia  and these are her parents  and they live in america  and i don t know what religion they are  but her dad sounds a little jewish   doesn t matter  dory arrives in america with her friends marlin and nemo   the host continued   she ends up at the marine life institute behind a large wall  they all have to get over the wall and you won t believe it  but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out   judging from the audience s applause  they particularly enjoyed degeneres  joke  even though dory gets into america  she ends up separated from her family  but the other animals help dory   degeneres began   animals that don t even need her  animals that don t even have anything in common with her  they help her  even though they re completely different colors  because that s what you do when you see someone in need   you help them  source  usa todaylet s hope degeneres speaks out more in the future  but when one of the nicest people in the world won t even welcome trump  perhaps trump should listen   not that he would featured image via alex wong getty images
