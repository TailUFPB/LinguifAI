donald trump ran an openly white supremacist campaign during his travesty of a run for the presidency  now that he is in the white house  this has continued  he has literal white supremacists working in the white house in the form of chief strategist stephen k  bannon  senior adviser sebastian gorka  and speechwriter and immigration policy maker stephen miller with trump s election  white supremacists across the nation have been emboldened  prior to his inauguration  white supremacist trump supporters held a gathering celebrating trump s victory in the reagan building in washington  in which people could be seen giving nazi salutes  and in which the leader of the gathering  richard spencer  shouted  heil trump   trump denounced these happenings in tepid terms  and only under intense public pressure  therefore  it should come as no surprise that he has not acknowledged that the reason that  people have been injured and one person is dead in charlottesville  virginia due to violence at a white nationalist rally is  well  the work and fault of hateful white supremacists  however  there is condemnation coming from a rather surprising source  gop senator marco rubio  r fl  during the gop primary  rubio was sharply critical of trump  he called trump a  con artist   and  erratic   nonetheless  once trump clinched the nomination  rubio dropped the criticism and lined up dutifully behind the man he knew was an unfit bigot and helped get him elected  now  however  it seems trump has gone too far in his refusal to acknowledge the rise in white supremacy in the trump era  rubio tweeted very important for the nation to hear  potus describe events in  charlottesville for what they are  a terror attack by  whitesupremacists  marco rubio   marcorubio  august    also roundly denounced the white supremacists themselves nothing patriotic about  nazis the  kkk or  whitesupremacists it s the direct opposite of what  america seeks to be   charlotesville  marco rubio   marcorubio  august    haters in  charlotesville are agitators in search of relevance   publicity for a vile cause very few people support    marco rubio   marcorubio  august    t ignore them but also don t give them relevance they crave only way they win is if they can turn the rest of us against each other    marco rubio   marcorubio  august    never thought i d agree with marco rubio on anything in a million years  but i do  donald trump has mainstreamed bigotry the likes of which america has not seen in public in this violent of a manner since the civil rights movement  and he is refusing to own it  then again  narcissists never own their own wrongdoing  so no surprise there if the gop wants to tamp down on this nonsense  they need to call out trump  and kick the racists out of their party  that starts with the band of white supremacists currently squatting in the white house  in fact  it starts with the man baby bigot  president  himself  kick them out  prove to us you aren t flaming racists  gop  until you expel trump and his disgustingly bigoted ideology  you will forever be known as t he party of white supremacists  and rightly so featured image via chet strange getty images
