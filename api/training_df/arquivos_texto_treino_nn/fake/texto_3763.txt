if you watched cnn during this highly contentious election cycle  you likely saw democrat van jones go toe to toe with jeffrey lord  who is an ardent trump supporter  the two agree on next to nothing  but there is one thing folks likely don t really know about the on air rivals  they re actually really good friends  jones had this to say about why he is friends with lord  when it is quite obvious that they are polar opposites on everything  how can you not like jeffrey  he s adorable  he s like a fraggle  if a fraggle had a tendency towards terrible revisionist history  sure  i could see that  lord doesn t seem like a mean spirited person  he s just terribly misinformed  especially when it comes to issues of racism  sexism  and other forms of bigotry that constantly plague america  that s obviously a problem  after all  it s this very ignorance that got the likes of donald trump elected president  however  that doesn t mean that he s necessarily a bad person  lord had similar sentiments when asked how he felt about what jones had to say about him  which is exactly how i feel about him  i think van s a terrific person and a great friend  we just disagree on everything  and god bless america  van jones and jeffrey lord are actually a good example of two people who could be role models for the rest of our incredibly divided nation  with the advances of technology  all you have to do is block people who you find to be intolerable  and you never get to hear the other side  now  make no mistake   there are plenty of trump supporters who belong in hillary s basket of deplorables  they are racist  sexist  islamophobic  homophobic  transphobic  xenophobic bigots whose views have absolutely no place in a diverse melting pot like the united states of america  however  the friendship between these two men should remind us all not to paint with a broad brush  not all hillary supporters brushed aside or refused to see her weaknesses as a candidate  and not all trump supporters are flaming bigots  perhaps jeffrey lord and van jones can help heal the hate and divisions  simply by being themselves featured image via video screen capture from youtube
