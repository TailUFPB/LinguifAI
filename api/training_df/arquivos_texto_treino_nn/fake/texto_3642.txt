when fox news host stuart varney bragged about donald trump wanting to imprison and strip citizenship from americans who burn the flag  fox legal analyst andrew napolitano smacked both of them down hard in a tweet posted around  on tuesday  trump literally called for punishing people who burn the american flag despite the fact that it s a form of expression protected by the first amendment nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag   if they do  there must be consequences   perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    tweet apparently pleased fox host stuart varney  but before he could even finish reading the quote  fox news legal analyst andrew napolitano laughed out loud and proceeded to school varney and humiliate trump with facts  what is wrong with a penalty for burning the american flag   varney asked  two supreme court opinions that say i can burn my flag  i can t burn yours   napolitano replied   burning the american flag is a form of protected freedom of speech as reprehensible as it is  as demonstrative of a hatred of american values as it is   i fully agree with the president elect on that  but you cannot prosecute for it  the reason i chuckled is the penalty of stripping citizenship has been prohibited in the united states of america since   varney suggested that trump could just  get a new supreme court and get a different ruling   but napolitano fired back  get a different constitution  rather than the one in which he was elected president  people cannot be prosecuted for expressing unpopular opinions  a giddy varney warned   not yet  here s the video via youtube what trump is calling for would even make deceased supreme court justice antonin scalia  a conservative hero  spin in his grave during a  interview  scalia said that punishing americans for flag burning is something that a king would do  if i were king  i wouldn t go about letting people burn the american flag   scalia told piers morgan   however  we have a first amendment which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged  and it is addressed  in particular to speech critical of the government  i mean  that was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress  burning the flag is a form of expression  here s the video via youtube so by trying to punish americans for expressing themselves  trump would be acting like the tyrannical king conservatives have accused president obama of being for the last eight years  only  in this case  trump would actually be a real tyrant featured image via  zach gibson getty images
