as donald trump condemned democrats as  animals  on sunday because a gop office was firebombed on saturday night  it was the democrats who raised money to help rebuild the office while trump didn t send a dime let s make one thing clear  whoever firebombed the gop office in hillsborough  north carolina is a terrorist  but we don t actually know who committed the act and we certainly don t know where the perpetrator s  stand politically but that didn t stop trump from immediately blaming hillary clinton supporters in his response to the incident animals representing hillary clinton and dems in north carolina just firebombed our office in orange county because we are winning  ncgop  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    course  hillary s response sounded way more presidential the attack on the orange county hq  ncgop office is horrific and unacceptable  very grateful that everyone is safe   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  october    while donald trump is busy demonizing hillary supporters and democrats  it is democrats who are saving the day in the name of democracy and compassion a group of democrats started a gofundme account to raise money in an effort to help the republican party rebuild the destroyed office and get it running again as soon as possible  as democrats  we are starting this campaign to enable the orange county  north carolina republican office to re open as soon as possible   the account s message reads  until an investigation is undertaken  we cannot know who did this or why  no matter the result  this is not how americans resolve their differences  we talk  we argue  sometimes we march  and most of all we vote  we do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs so  let s all pitch in  no matter what your party affiliation  in and get that office open again quickly  and while trump hasn t provided any money to help rebuild the office  these democrats raised    in a matter of hours to give to the north carolina gop in a spectacular demonstration of american values  this is a moment for graciousness  not fractiousness   said jeff jarvis  one of the democrats who helped put this fundraiser together unlike donald trump s selfishness and accusatory rhetoric  democrats displayed true patriotism and compassion for their fellow americans even though they are divided by political beliefs  this is the true definition of citizenship and you have to wonder if republicans would do the same if it were a democratic office that had been bombed  surely  they would  but it s hard to say considering trump is painting democrats as  animals  who hate america featured image  jessica kourkounis getty images
