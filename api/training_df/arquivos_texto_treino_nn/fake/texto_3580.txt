we ve long been suspicious of russian meddling in our political process  with intelligence officials going so far as to say they re confident they know russia hacked various email systems  including that of the dnc  with trump s election  russia sees a huge victory as their puppet prepares to take office one russian governor  viktor nazarov  actually  literally said  according to cbs news  it turns out that united russia won the elections in america  united russia is putin s political party  and not russia itself  regardless  that is still a bold proclamation to make  whether he s talking about putin meddling or just a u s  puppet government for putin to use to strengthen russia  russia suffers from a crippled economy thanks to sanctions  and they seem to see us as their ticket out of all that it s more likely that see us as their ticket to restored power so they re once again on equal footing with us  hillary wouldn t have done that   the democrats have taken a strong line against russia  as have most republicans  with the bromance that exists between trump and putin  though  russia probably hopes that congress will give in to their new leader putin  of course  denies that russia did anything at all with our electoral process despite nsa claims that he definitely did  he claimed conspiracy theory  saying that the american left was using this theory as a distraction  if his governors and other officials can t keep from saying that russia was the big winner in our elections  though  then what are we really to think as boris zilberman  an expert on russia  said  it s not that putin is against the democratic party  he s more against the united states and  for  whatever may push russian interests  how convenient for putin  then  that his best american buddy  trump  got elected  it s sickening to think that russia might have been the big winner of our elections  but it s hard to ignore russian officials who say so featured image via greg baker pool getty images and joe raedle getty images
