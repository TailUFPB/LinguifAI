paul congemi  a republican candidate running for mayor of st  petersburg  florida  sent a clear message to black voters at a forum on tuesday when he told mayoral opponent jesse nevel and members of the uhuru solidarity movement to  go back to africa  congemi claims to have been a life long democrat who switched to republican after former president barack obama showed his support for gay marriage  nevel  on the other hand  is white and has been running his campaign on the slogan  unity through reparations   and has also spoken out against gentrification and police brutality then there is the uhuru solidarity movement  a socialist organization of white people who believe that the key to ending racial inequality is through reparations  but congemi sees things from different angle  mr  nevel you and your people talk about reparations  the reparations that you talk about  mr  nevel  your people already got your reparations  your reparations came in the form of a man named barack obama   congemi said at tuesday s forum   my advice to you  if you don t like it here in america  planes leave every hour from tampa airport  go back to africa  go back to africa  go back   he continued  repeatedly pointing at the crowd and later making motions to exit his statement was met with a combination of shock and disgust  with one woman in the crowd shouting  get out of here   after congemi s comment about barack obama rick kriseman  the sitting mayor of st  petersburg  was also critical of the candidate s words  claiming on wednesday that congemi s statement was hateful  bigoted  and unacceptable toward black and gay floridians  jesse nevel also saw the move as tactless  saying that congemi s comment reflects a segment of my community  i ve met plenty of other people who feel that way  that s why i feel that it s important for those of us in the white community to take a public stand with reparations  in typical republican fashion  congemi tried to weasel his way out of the firestorm he had created  telling the washington post that he has  nothing against african americans who are doing their best here in america   and that his remarks were only aimed at those who are pushing for reparations  he even referred to nevel as a  self hating white man  the controversy doesn t seem to have slowed congemi down  and he claims that anyone who believes he is racist simply misunderstood his comments  even if he loses this time  he s not going to stop  i ll run again in  and  god willing  if i m alive in   i ll run then  too   congemi said   i intend to keep running and running and running  featured image via video screen capture from youtube
