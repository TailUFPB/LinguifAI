it would seem that the democrats  talking point  that healthcare is a human right  isn t just a talking point  the united nations has taken notice of republicans  efforts to repeal obamacare without a solid replacement that will guarantee nobody loses their coverage  the gop s plans all involve stipulations that could strip coverage from millions  which could violate international laws to which the u s  is bound the u n  s high commissioner on human rights sent a letter to the trump administration  and asked that it be shared with republican and democratic leaders in congress  of course  house minority leader nancy pelosi  and senate minority leader chuck schumer  didn t receive it  at least  not through the usual channels  oddly enough  neither did paul ryan or mitch mcconnell apparently  the state department never saw it either  but an employee at hhs leaked it to democratic leadership the letter cites article  of the international covenant on economic  social and cultural rights  which says   the core obligation to ensure the right of access to health facilities  goods and services on a non discriminatory basis  especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups  it also cites article  e  of the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination  which says   guarantee the right of everyone   including  the rights to public health  medical care  social security and social services  without regard to race or color  it s important to note that while we both signed and ratified the latter agreement here if obamacare is repealed without a replacement that protects coverage for everyone  the people who stand to lose their insurance  and thus  their access to healthcare  are the poor and the working class  racial minorities are more likely to be poor  or a member of the struggling working class  rural areas with depressed economies  the places that all voted for trump  would suffer  too since the trump administration didn t send the letter on as requested  it stands to reason that they don t want congress to see this  or really  anyone   too bad it got out  at best  this is another pr and political disaster that trump doesn t need  at worst  we re in some serious trouble if they don t give up their plans to strip millions of their health insurance featured image by olivier douliery pool via getty images
