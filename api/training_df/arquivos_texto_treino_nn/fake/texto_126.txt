fox news has decided to cancel certain ads on their network  completing their transition from a conservative network into a safe space for their fragile trump fans  and after trump himself threw a livid fit  a series of ads by political activist tom steyer  which call for trump s impeachment  has been pulled because of the reaction to it from their viewers  seriously  due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers  we could not in good conscience take their money  why  because their viewers will abandon the network if they show any signs of trying to be balanced  of course  fox news is a private entity and is allowed to do this  but the question remains  is it censorship if they did so because of pressure from trump  the unhinged presidential impostor did go on twitter to call steyer  wacky   totally unhinged  when the  impeach trump  campaign was first launched in late october  that may well have put pressure on fox to pull it wacky   totally unhinged tom steyer  who has been fighting me and my make america great again agenda from beginning  never wins elections   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    president trump is known for his attacks on the  fake news  media  and it s entirely possible that fox news is terrified of him  or  at the very least  terrified that he ll stop coming for ridiculously easy and softball interviews from friendly neighborhood conspiracy theorists like sean hannity steyer  for his part  is claiming that fox is in breach of contract over this  his lawyer  brad deutsch  said that  on oct    fox had agreed unconditionally to air the ads for one more week  canceling the ads when they did  signaled a profound failure of journalistic integrity  a suppression of constitutionally protected speech  and likely a consequence of inexcusable political pressure   watch the ad below featured image via ethan miller getty images
