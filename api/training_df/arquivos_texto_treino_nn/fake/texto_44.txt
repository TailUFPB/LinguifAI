donald trump s disgraced national security adviser michael flynn has just plead guilty to lying to the fbi   a felony  he has also agreed to testify against trump in exchange for leniency from special counsel robert mueller s team  the irony here is beyond delicious   especially since flynn infamously led the  lock her up   chants at the  republican national convention  saying that hillary clinton was some kind of criminal  and that if trump was elected they d be able to put her in jail  where many trump supporters believe she belongs  well  now the tables are turned  and it is flynn who will be heading to jail  and the people who realize who the real criminals are have been having a field day  perhaps one of the best pieces of twitter schaudenfraude is this video of flynn heading into court to plead guilty with the  lock her up   chant being played i mashed up michael flynn s perp walk with audio of him leading a  lock her up  chant  pic twitter com   adam smith     december    is beyond awesome  these fools thought they d get a chance to put hillary clinton in jail as if we live in some kind of banana republic  instead  they are all turning on each other in order to save their own asses in the best circular firing squad any of us ever could have imagined  michael flynn is going to sing like a canary so that he can keep himself and his equally criminal son out of federal prison   and railroad the entire trump crime family into the slammer   just where they belong the gop made a deal with the devil when their ignorant  bigoted voters chose this unfit orange overlord to be their presidential nominee  now  they are very likely to rue the day they ever heard the name donald trump featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
