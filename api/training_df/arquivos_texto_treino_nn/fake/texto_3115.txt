for the first time in our lives  we are entering an era where we have elected a president who is downright dangerous  donald trump is petty  childish  ignorant  thin skinned  vengeful  and a wannabe dictator   and he will soon be the most powerful man on the planet  well  it seems that there are some highly respected people who realize this  and hopefully they can keep us all safe during this travesty of a presidency  one such person is national security expert and former intelligence officer malcolm nance nance sat down for a chat with msnbc s joy reid on saturday morning  and he did not mince words when it came to the dangers of trump  and what he believes the incoming president elect strongman has in store for america s top spy agencies  first  reid began  let s just get to donald trump s refusal to be able to accept  malcolm  the conclusions of the intelligence community even when the head of the intelligence agencies are sitting in front of him telling him this happened  why in your view will he not just accept it  nance s reply was most ominous  i think because  when donald trump made his statement on july  of last year where he asked for russia to hack hillary clinton and release her e mails  at that point he went from being an unwitting useful idiot to russia to actually believing that they were working in his favor  to admit that now  in the face of all the evidence  he would believe that this would delegitimize his presidency and he will fight to the end to not allow this to become a narrative  of course he will  it s a telltale trait of people with authoritarian tendencies to be unable to have their legitimacy questioned for any reason whatsoever  trump will stop at nothing to prevent the media from talking about this  hell  given his constant attacks on them  he may even try to use the power of the presidency to prohibit there being any sort of check on him for any reason  but especially when it comes to russia nance continued  i suspect that in two weeks he s going to attempt to cover this all up and even gut the intelligence community  he is pushing this nation to a constitutional crisis of unprecedented magnitude  because no one has ever worked in the interests of a hostile nation and supporting  to a certain extent  a hostile intelligence service  nance is exactly right  trump is dangerous  he is looking to serve his own interests  not those of the united states of america  should he continue along this path   and we know that he will   the people in a position of power to do something about him better damn well do it fast  lest he shred the constitution and destroy american democracy forever watch the video below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
