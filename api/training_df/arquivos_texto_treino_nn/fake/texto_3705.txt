donald trump s tuesday meeting with the new york times was already controversial to begin with  and it ended in a similar fashion  not only has the newspaper been a target of trump s twitter attacks after reporting true  but negative  coverage on him  but trump abruptly canceled his meeting without notifying the paper  only to follow through at the last minute but even after the meeting had happened  it wasn t the end of the volatile emotions surrounding trump s visit  upon exiting the meeting and walking through the main lobby of the new york times building  trump was met with loud boos from the crowd that tried to cover up the cheers  in the footage below  trump can be seen walking through the lobby and waving to the crowd  who had very mixed reactions to the president elect  reporters were busy shouting questions to trump  but the crowd drowned them out cbs news tried to ignore the negative reaction as it tweeted  donald trump is greeted with cheers as he leaves meeting with the new york times  however  the video clip accompanying that caption tells a different story  at the end of the video  the cbsn anchor corrected himself and said  alright  so a mix of cheers  and some boos  i think  update  donald trump is greeted with cheers as he leaves meeting with the new york times https   t co  pic twitter com   cbs news   cbsnews  november    is yet another first for america   it has been unheard of for both a president elect and vice president elect to be booed in public appearances   and within days of each other  it s clear that trump and pence are the most controversial  divisive team the country has ever been faced with  and their level of disapproval is unprecedented the media should certainly be latching onto this  instead of pretending that people are only cheering for trump  to suggest that the american people are ready to accept trump and pence is dishonest  these videos show a nation that is divided and upset with this election  and the media should portray the truth of it regardless of whether trump throws a twitter fit or not trump leaves the times pic twitter com   michael calderone   mlcalderone  november     a mix of cheers  boos  and shouted questions as trump leaves the nyt building https   t co   brian stelter   brianstelter  november    image via screenshot
