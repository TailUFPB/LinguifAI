donald trump seems determined to make sure that the united states of america is never seen as the leader of the free world again  as his disastrous treatment of the leaders of allied nations at the nato and  summits and his continued attacks on democratic values and his buffoonish behavior on twitter isn t enough  it is now being reported that trump plans to continue to put his dangerous and ridiculous notion that climate change is some kind of chinese hoax into policy  he has taken his worst step yet in that direction  and now plans to pull out of the paris accord on climate change around  countries   including all of the world s developed nations   are a part of the deal  of which the united states was instrumental in sealing  now  we will be on par with third world countries on this issue because one of our political parties seems to think that science isn t real  the decision comes after senate republicans wrote trump a letter urging him to pull out of the deal  citing regulations that would cost american jobs  then again  we know that the gop isn t that bright on this issue and many others this move comes on the heels of the trump administration rolling back most of the climate regulations that the obama administration had put in place to help save the environment  the paris accord would have the united states commit to reducing carbon emissions by  to  percent beyond the disastrous effects on the environment  this is just devastating to america s standing in the world  it shows everyone that we are no longer ready to lead  that we are taking an isolationist approach when it comes to important issues on the world stage  and that we are led by incompetent  science denying fools who only care about their own craven quest for power say goodbye to your standing in the world  fellow americans  it was nice while it lasted here s video coverage from our partners at content news   featured image via sean gallup getty images
