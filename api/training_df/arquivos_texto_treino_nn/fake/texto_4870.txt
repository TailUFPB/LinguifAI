president obama used this week s  weekly address  to discuss the zika virus and slam the republicans who have chosen to block the funding necessary to fight the spread of this mosquito borne disease the president began by talking about a call he had gotten from a pregnant woman named ashley who said she was  extremely concerned  about zika and  what it might mean for other pregnant women like her   he added that  as a father  he shared this mother s worry  conservatives in congress on the other hand  not so much  republicans in congress did not share ashley s  extreme concern   nor that of other americans expecting children  they said no  instead  we were forced to use resources we need to keep fighting ebola  cancer  and other diseases  we took that step because we have a responsibility to protect the american people  said obama   but that s not a sustainable solution  and congress has been on a seven week recess without doing anything to protect americans from the zika virus  obama said that his  administration has done what we can on our own   but that is not nearly enough to stop the spread of this disease  he explained the steps that citizens can take to try to protect themselves from the mosquitos who carry and spread the virus  use insect repellent  wear long sleeves and pants  get rid of standing water where mosquitos breed  etc and then  president obama tore into the republican lawmakers who have been dragging their feet when it comes to funding the measures that will stop the threat of this disease  which is known to cause serious birth defects when a pregnant woman is infected  including microcephaly  but every day that republican leaders in congress wait to do their job  every day our experts have to wait to get the resources they need   that has real life consequences  weaker mosquito control efforts  longer wait times to get accurate diagnostic results  delayed vaccines  it puts more americans at risk  one republican senator has said that  there is no such thing as a republican position on zika or democrat position on zika because these mosquitoes bite everyone   i agree  we need more republicans to act that way because this is more important than politics  it s about young mothers like ashley  today  her new baby savannah is healthy and happy  that s priority number one  and that s why republicans in congress should treat zika like the threat that it is and make this their first order of business when they come back to washington after labor day  that means working in a bipartisan way to fully fund our zika response  a fraction of the funding won t get the job done  you can t solve a fraction of a disease  our experts know what they re doing  they just need the resources to do it  watch president obama s weekly address featured image via video screen capture
