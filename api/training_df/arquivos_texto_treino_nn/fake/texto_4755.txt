vermont senator bernie sanders hit the campaign trail for his former opponent in the democratic primary on monday  and he didn t mince words when it came to republican nominee donald trump  as we all know  trump has run one of the ugliest  most bigoted campaigns we ve seen this side of the civil rights era  to that end  bernie wasn t just there to stump for hillary  but also to make sure his audience understands just who donald trump is  and what he stands for  bernie began  my opposition to trump goes beyond the fact that he refuses to recognize the reality of climate change  it goes beyond his willingness to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut programs for working people  my opposition in the strongest way to trump is that he is making the cornerstone of his campaign  not economics  not healthcare  not the environment   the essence of his campaign is bigotry  bernie didn t stop there  though  and continued the all  out assault on trump from his platform on the stage in lebanon  new hampshire  we re supposed to hate anybody who is different than we are  he went on to remind everyone of trump s outrageous statements regarding muslims  women  mexicans  and other groups  after all  lest we forget  trump actually kicked his campaign off by calling mexican immigrants rapists and criminals  after that  he called for  quote   a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states  of course  we all know that trump has spent the last year and a half appealing to the most disgusting and dark elements of the underbelly of racist american populism  he has brought overt racism and fringe white supremacy mainstream   so much so  in fact  that he has inspired former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke to run for the u s  senate so  gop  remember all of these facts next time you try to tell minorities that your party isn t bigoted  with trump as your standard   bearer  how the hell can you expect us to believe that good on you  bernie  for calling a spade a spade  and reminding the american people just who and what donald trump and his disgusting campaign really is featured image via darren mccollester getty images
