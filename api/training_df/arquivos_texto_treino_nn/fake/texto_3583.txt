conservatives are damned liars and they need to be called out every time they claim donald trump s campaign wasn t racist throughout the  presidential campaign  donald trump constantly winked and nodded at white supremacists and white nationalists to the point where they threw their support to his campaign and starting showing up at his rallies in fact  the only group of voters that donald trump did not insult or denounce were white racists while he consistently spewed hateful and discriminatory rhetoric at latinos  black people  and muslims it is common knowledge that racism was a key part of trump s vicious campaign  but trump supporter betsy mccaughey repeatedly claimed otherwise and actually had the gall to accuse democrats of being the real racists during a saturday appearance on cnn with democratic counterpart symone sanders  who is black  i think the campaign has been very gracious in victory   mccaughey claimed   but what disturbs me the most is to see the democratic party leaders and spokespeople like symone are still making false accusations of racism   in fact  behaving like racists themselves  one reason donald trump won is americans are sick and tired of reverse racism and that s what they heard from hillary clinton at the beginning  except that hillary clinton s message was about coming together and building a stronger america for everyone  trump  meanwhile  questioned president obama s place of birth for years  accused a judge of being biased because  he s a mexican   repeatedly condoned beatings of black protesters at his rallies  and refused to denounce white supremacists among many other examples mccaughey ranted on about how democrats are to blame for racism in this country  only to be absolutely buried by sanders  we ve got to cut this out   sanders said   betsy  people of color in america are victims of systemic racism and i think it s really important to note that while the trump campaign  yes  they won  donald trump is going to be the next president  there are still some real underlying issues  the rhetoric that the campaign elevated  these fringe elements that they brought into the mainstream  these are the things that people in america are still dealing with  the trump campaign has to at least own that so we can move forward  and the truth bomb that sanders dropped made mccaughey lose her shit to the point that she actually directed a racist term at sanders and instantly proved sanders  point  i don t appreciate these accusations of racism because they are untrue and the only reason that people like symone constantly label their opponents as racist is because they don t have an argument they can win on the merits  again  symone sanders is a black woman  so when mccaughey said  people like symone   it was instantly recognized as racist  racists often use the term  you people  as a racial slur in order to dehumanize their opponent and blame an entire class or race of people for something even sanders pointed it out   betsy just  you people d  me  thank you  thus  sanders won the argument and made mccaughey reveal herself as a racist on national television here s the video via youtube mccaughey is also dead wrong about trump being gracious in victory  he has been anything but gracious  in fact  he s rubbing it in by going on an unprecedented victory tour  if president obama had done that in   conservatives would have thrown temper tantrums across the country and hurled the n word at will the bottom line is that donald trump did not win this election by having better policies  he won because he energized the racists in this country to vote for him  and the fact that he picked people like jeff sessions and steve bannon for key positions in his administration speaks volumes about how racist he is  especially since the kkk and white nationalists overwhelmingly approve of those two choices featured image via screenshot
