white house chief strategist stephen k  bannon has long been a controversial figure  prior to joining donald trump s campaign  he was the head of breitbart news  a racist website that bannon said was the  platform for the alt right   the alt right  is  of course  nothing more than a rebranded name for white supremacists  ever since trump made bannon his chief strategist  there have been calls for his removal from the white house  now  in the wake of trump s disgraceful response to the violent and murderous gathering of white supremacists in charlottesville  virgnina  it is being reported that bannon is finally being pushed out of course  trump is a coward  though  so it will be public humiliation  like what was suffered by former republican national committee head turned white house chief of staff reince priebus  that will be the technique to get rid of bannon  however  as is par for the course with this white house  bannon aids and allies are saying that bannon had already decided to leave team trump  and that it just hadn t been announced yet  from the new york times the president and senior white house officials were debating when and how to dismiss mr  bannon  the two administration officials cautioned that mr  trump is known to be averse to confrontation within his inner circle  and could decide to keep on mr  bannon for some time as of friday morning  the two men were still discussing mr  bannon s future  the officials said  a person close to mr  bannon insisted the parting of ways was his idea  and that he had submitted his resignation to the president on aug    to be announced at the start of this week  but it was delayed in the wake of the racial unrest in charlottesville  va methinks there s a lot of lying on both sides going on here  trump has clearly been afraid of dismissing bannon  for fear of the obvious ability of bannon to turn all of the far right media   and thus crucial parts of his base   against him  via the very influential far right publications he holds such enormous sway over  on bannon s part  he didn t want to go anywhere  because his stated goal has always been to  quote   destroy the administrative state  either way  it s a good thing that the head of the modern white supremacist movement will be reportedly leaving the white house  now  we just have to get rid of the rest of the nazis  and we ll really be in business featured image via mario tama getty images
