donald trump is slated to visit great britain this summer  and meet with prince charles while he s there  and the white house warned prince charles to avoid  lecturing  trump on issues like climate change members of trump s inner circle have warned british officials that it would be counterproductive for charles to  lecture  trump on green issues during the president s june visit to britain  and that the president will  erupt  if pushed  the sunday times of london reported well  isn t that a nice way of telling prince charles to fuck off if he brings up climate change  one could even take that to be some kind of veiled threat  but it s more likely that came from trump needing to feel like he knows everything about everything and doesn t need to be educated on anything trump is a known climate denier and also has  ahem  a tendency to fly off the handle when anyone tries to tell him he s wrong  he screwed up  or basically doesn t kiss his boots and his ass  he still hasn t grasped the fact that he s the least popular person to assume the highest office in our nation  let alone that people won t immediately acknowledge his amazing intelligence and understanding of the world he s been looking to pull the u s  out of the big paris climate accord as quickly as possible  even looking for ways to circumvent the four year process for withdrawing  he believes that environmental regulations are harmful to business and that we must do away with them  he wants to do away with them so badly he scrubbed all mention of climate change from the white house s website the instant he was sworn in  and started gagging federal agencies directly involved with environmental issues to boot prince charles  however  has not ruled out bringing the subject up  even though he ll probably try and work to avoid the appearance of  lecturing   sadly  though  trump will probably see any talk that doesn t fit his views to a tee as  lecturing  the white house is treating prince charles like he s the egotistical know it all who should shut up and listen  but what can we expect from an administration that openly and loudly calls for members of the press to be fired for reporting facts they don t like photo of prince charles by arthur edwards  wpa pool getty images  photo of donald trump by olivier douliery pool getty images
