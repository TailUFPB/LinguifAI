the american people are not going to like this at all if you really believed that donald trump cares about working people and america  this interview will shatter your delusions trump has promised to make infrastructure spending a top priority in his administration and it s expected to carry at least a   trillion price tag usually  every american who pays taxes  from the rich to the poor and from corporations to small businesses  helps pay the bill but trump s scheme would not only enrich his corporate buddies  it would allow foreigners to fleece the american people as well for decades by reimbursing private companies through the use of tolls on roads and bridges  which would be privately owned during an interview with sean hannity last week  transportation secretary elaine chao  who also happens to be mitch mcconnell s wife  let the cat out of the bag when she admitted that working americans would be saddled with the costs of the projects and that would also mean paying tolls to enrich foreign investors  after explaining it  hannity attempted to bail her out by spinning it as a  win win  for taxpayers  if i m hearing it properly  what you re saying is  for example  if a company were to rebuild a road  they might get their investment back by having a toll on that road and that s where the taxpayers don t pay a penny  they make a profit  it s a win win  something like that   hannity said  thanks for putting it that way   chao replied except that it s not a  win win   basically  trump s plan would allow private companies to pay for building or repairing a road or bridge and then they would force americans to pay a toll so the company would make their money back and profit off the backs of every american who uses the road or bridge to get to work every day  companies would literally be nickel and diming the people  and it would be the local citizens who get hit the hardest saying that taxpayers  don t pay a penny  is a complete lie but that s not all chao repeatedly slipped up when she tried to explain that private investors would fund the roads  so  basically  we allow foreign inv uh  we allow different kinds of money  private sector money to come into the united states i m not saying foreign to come and fund  let s say a bridge or a road or it can be any kind of infrastructure  that s right  chao just admitted that foreign investors would also be able to basically own american roads and make us pay them to use them  and cenk uygur knows why uygur explained on his young turks show that chao is the daughter of a taiwanese businessman who got rich investing in transportation that means chao and her family could personally enrich themselves under trump s scheme here s the hannity interview and uygur s commentary via twitter transportation secretary  elainechao may have accidentally let her true intentions slip during a  seanhannnity interview  pic twitter com   the young turks   theyoungturks  march    again  donald trump is scamming working americans to make himself and his friends rich while the rest of us pay the bill for the rest of our lives  our infrastructure would literally be owned and operated by private companies and foreigners while we pay the price  it s unfair  it s un american  and it should piss off every american citizen featured image via screenshot
