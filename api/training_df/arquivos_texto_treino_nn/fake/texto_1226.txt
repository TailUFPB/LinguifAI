on thursday  thanks to strange senate rules  john mccain found himself with the opportunity to question fired fbi director james comey   and he sure didn t waste the opportunity  ok  we lied  yes he did like his gop colleagues  mccain tried his hardest to swing the russia hearings back to being about hillary clinton  in fact  mccain demanded that president   yes  he called him president  comey explain why he has decided that hillary clinton is innocent of colluding with russia to sabotage her own campaign but the fbi insists on investigating trump   a  double standard  as mccain sees it mccain  who is apparently unable to wrap his head around the fact that an investigation into hillary clinton about something entirely separate had concluded while the investigation into trump s collusion with the kremlin is ongoing  appeared to become confused during his questioning   then things got crazy  crazier    i think it s hard to reconcile one case you reached a complete conclusion and the other side you have not  in fact  obviously  there s a lot more there as we know   he said   she s one of the candidates but in her case you say there will be no charges but in the case of president trump the investigation continues  both president trump and former candidate clinton are involved in the investigation yet one of them you said there s gonna be no charges and the other the investigation continues   mccain added   i think there s a double standard  obviously  there s no double standard here   but mccain s words  you reached the conclusion that there was no reason to bring charges against secretary clinton so you reached the conclusion  in the case of mr  comey  president comey  the case of president trump you ve got one candidate you re done with and another where you have a long way to go  watch the crazy below featured image via screengrab
