even though trump appears to have softened his own position on the idea that climate change is a  hoax perpetrated by the chinese   some of his cabinet picks suggest he s still very much a climate denier  and he himself has targeted the fossil fuel industry as ripe for repealing environmental regulations  but california has made a lot of progress of its own on the environment  and governor jerry brown will not let trump or a republican congress change that he plans to act in direct defiance of anything trump does  at the american geophysical union conference in san francisco  he flat out said  we re ready to ride the backlash back to sanity  sustainability  and truth  scientific truth is such an alien concept to trump that it s ridiculous  then again  pretty much any type of truth is an alien concept to trump brown wasn t done after that  either  he also said  we will set the stage  we ll set the example  and whatever washington thinks they re doing  california is the future  if trump turns off his satellites  california will launch its own damn satellite  we re going to collect that data  california does have facilities capable of launching satellites  so that s not necessarily an empty promise  in fact  vandenberg air force base has seven rocket launches scheduled for  already  one launch will put a weather satellite in orbit  while another will put several earth observation satellites in space trump s behavior on climate change since winning the election is alarming to anyone who trusts science over conspiracy theories and religious dogma  and california is no exception  if trump puts laws into place  or repeals laws that california needs  brown says  we ve got the scientists  we ve got the lawyers  and we re ready to fight  we re ready to defend  california is no stranger to this fight  it s not immediately clear how brown will pay for his defiance of trump and the gop on something like launching satellites  because vandenberg is a federal facility  obviously   and dependent on both its military budget and nasa s budget  the latter of which is at the whim of a congress hostile to action climate change regardless  it s clear that he will do his best to push forward however he can  trump s climate denialism be damned  judging by the response he got from scientists at the conference  they plan to help him out in any way they can  too watch him shred trump to ribbons below featured image by justin sullivan via getty images
