even fox news is not pleased about sean hannity citing unscientific polls to claim that donald trump won the first debate with hillary clinton not long after the republican nominee finished being clubbed by his democratic opponent  the fox news host was quick to use online polls as proof that trump was victorious  even though such polls are often flooded by internet users to skew the results in favor of one candidate or the other  i ll give you the list of polls   hannity crowed before listing time magazine  drudge report  cnbc  the hill  and cbs as online polls that said trump won  the only one that has hillary winning is cnn and they re the clinton news network anyway   hannity complained   cnn s poll had  respondents  these polls have thousands of respondents and cnn is the clinton news network  but all of these polls were online polls that are easy to manipulate and are simply inaccurate and that why fox news vice president of public opinion research dana blanton sent out a memo calling out hannity and other fox hosts for using such polls   as most of the publications themselves clearly state  the sample obviously can t be representative of the electorate because they only reflect the views of those internet users who have chosen to participate   blanton wrote  another problem   we know some campaigns groups of supporters encourage people to vote in online polls and flood the results  these quickie click items do not meet our editorial standards  news networks and other organizations go to great effort and rigor to conduct scientific polls   for good reason  they know quick vote items posted on the web are nonsense  not true measures of public opinion  unfortunately  despite the fact that fox news acknowledged that these polls are unscientific and should not be cited by their on air personalities  hannity and others apparently ignored the memo and continued touting them of course  it s pretty clear why hannity would rather tout online polls  after all  a real scientific poll like one conducted by public policy polling after the debate shows that most people surveyed said clinton won the debate  percent compared with only  percent who said trump won in addition  the poll not only shows that clinton won by a landslide among young voters  blacks  latinos  and women  she beat trump handily in more specific categories as well by a  point margin     voters say clinton has the temperament to be president  on the other hand  by an  point margin     voters say trump does not have the temperament to be president  among independents the gap is even wider  by a   spread they say clinton has the temperament for the job  while by a   spread they say trump does not by an  point margin     voters say clinton is prepared to be president  on the other hand  by a  point margin     voters say trump is not prepared to be president by a  point margin     voters say they think clinton can be trusted with nuclear weapons  on the other hand  by a  point margin     voters say they think trump can not be trusted with nuclear weapons once again  science proves that hannity and fox news are full of shit featured image  screenshot
