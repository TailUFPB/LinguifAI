trump s popularity continues to slip and slide downhill  including with his base  every segment of his base  even those that are traditionally republican  one demographic hasn t voted for a democrat since   but that could change in  as they find themselves increasingly dissatisfied  a new gallup poll shows that the military community  which trump won by  points last year  now disapproves of him  percent to  percent  that s a  point difference there in other words  according to gallup who conducted the poll that s a  point swing away from how they saw him during his first  days  prior to april   trump still had a  point advantage with the military  may could be an outlier  or it could be the harbinger of a trend that should scare the hell out of republicans military members and their families tend to lean conservative  even though it s primarily the republicans who toss them aside when they come back from war  saying   we don t have enough money for the va  too bad  so sad    they re less diverse than the general population  and are less educated than the general public  they also tend to be more religious and more culturally conservative than civilians  so in short  their makeup looks very republican that makes this poll surprising and possibly damaging for the gop  particularly with a contentious midterm coming up next year and a standard bearer that can t crawl out of the hole of record disapproval in which he finds himself  he s certainly not winning anyone over with his proposal to close more military bases  which military communities tend to depend on for their own livelihood  the russia scandal and his missteps  like firing james comey and antagonizing our intelligence services  probably aren t helping either this falling approval among the military community can present an opportunity for democrats to slide in if they find solid ways to reach them  the truth is that they still have a significant disadvantage there  but disapproval for a president can translate to disapproval for his party  that  in turn  can lead to some conservatives deciding to vote democratic if this trend continues among the military community  then the gop will probably find itself in some trouble  they rely on this part of their base  now that part of their base is weakening featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
