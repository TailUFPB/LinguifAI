a facebook event called  shoot at hurricane irma  popped up just before the powerful storm made landfall in florida  and apparently people took it seriously enough that the police felt they had to issue warnings not to do it over   people responded to the event  which tells us two things  one  that the event s young and naive creator  ryon edwards  had no freaking clue what he was really doing  and two  that people really are dumb enough to accept this on its face rather than question it  that s probably more true of right wing gun nuts than anything since the nuttier part of the right loves any excuse to shoot off their firearms the pasco county sheriff s department  concerned that idiots might actually try this  tweeted the following in response to the interest in the event to clarify  do not shoot weapons    irma  you won t make it turn around   it will have very dangerous side effectshttps   t co   pasco sheriff   pascosheriff  september    s a tiny bit like firing your weapon straight into the air  what goes up  must come down  and the bullets can come down on perfectly innocent people and cause serious injury  in the case of a hurricane  the bullets can get spun around  more or less  and come back to you or someone near you  that warning tweet has been retweeted nearly   times edwards claimed that he created the event out of  stress and boredom   the response apparently was a complete surprise to him  with him saying that he never thought this would get so out of control  people have allegedly even created graphics that show how to shoot at the hurricane  correctly   and other facebook events have appeared  with one suggesting using flamethrowers to stop the hurricane it s really hard to tell what s sarcasm and what s not sometimes  especially for  well  stupid people  edwards would have been better off finding something else to do with his  stress and boredom   because yes  people really are that stupid featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
