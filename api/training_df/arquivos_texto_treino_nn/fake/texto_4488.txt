there s already been hints from nbc news that lester holt  the moderator for the first presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton  will not be fact checking the candidates  this  of course  will allow trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable   except by hillary clinton but to make matters worse  all cable news networks  including those critical of trump  are pledging to be completely spineless  and will not offer any on screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong while on screen fact checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate  nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks  including univision and telemundo  said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics    thus  the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to holt  the only other person on the stage after politico documented that trump lies on average every three and a half minutes  one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest  open debate on the issues  but sadly  the media  realizing their ratings are on the line  would rather kowtow to donald trump and his band of deplorable surrogates the clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold trump accountable  with clinton campaign communications director jennifer palmieri telling reporters for the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give donald trump an unfair advantage  we do believe it is the role of the moderator   to call out those lies and to do that in real time unfortunately  with trump s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods  it s somehow up to hillary clinton to  shine  at the debate if she hopes to  win   this double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history  just to look slightly better than him  is abhorrent hopefully  clinton will wipe the floor with trump on the first debate  but with no one to back her up  it may be hard convincing the american people that she did it if there is one thing this election has shown us  it s that journalism is dying  if not already dead featured image via sara d  davis getty images
