hillary clinton has had it with donald trump s rude  offensive supporters and the numerous intimidation tactics they try to use against her and the rest of the country on tuesday night  clinton was holding a rally at reverend samuel delevoe memorial park in fort lauderdale when a trump supporter shouted   bill clinton is a rapist   over and over  disrupting her speech  as clinton s supporters tried to drown out the trump lover by shouting clinton s name  the democratic nominee reacted and went off on the protester  delivering the perfect rant while pointing right at the man  she said  you know  i am sick and tired of the negative  dark  divisive  dangerous vision and behavior from people who support donald trump  it is time for us to say no  we are not going backwards  we re going forward into a brighter future  the protester  who was completely unharmed during this entire incident  was taken out of the rally by security  but before he left  clinton left the trump supporter  and anyone else like him  with this parting wisdom  you may be angry about something  but anger is not a plan  don t be used  don t be exploited  you can watch clinton unload on the trump supporter below the protester in the video was likely causing issues at clinton s event not because he actually believes that her husband  former president bill clinton  is a rapist   but because the website infowars has offered to pay anyone shouting  bill clinton is a rapist  at a clinton rally a hefty reward of     yes  these are the desperate tactics conservatives are using to try to bring clinton down as she crushed trump in the polls  it s unfortunate and nearly pointless for them  it s costing them tons of money to continue smearing her name  and none of it is working featured image via joe raedle   getty images
