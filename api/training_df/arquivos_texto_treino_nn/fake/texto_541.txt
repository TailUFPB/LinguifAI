donald trump is going to jail  and his former business partner knows it the investigation into trump s russia scandal is ongoing  but it is getting closer to nailing him for collusion and other crimes special prosecutor robert mueller has convened a grand jury to hear evidence  and that includes a former trump business partner who is preparing to go prison over what he has to say but he won t be alone in his cell  because what felix sater says could land trump in the bunk right next to him sater worked with trump on many of his shady business dealings  including selling real estate to the russians  one property being involved in a money laundering scheme mueller s investigation into trump s financial dealings has apparently dug up some really juicy stuff that proves trump is a criminal who should be behind bars instead of the oval office trump tipped off investigators by warning mueller to stay away from his family s finances  and he tipped them off even further by admitting that he may have sold condos to russians  i mean  it s possible there s a condo or something  so  you know  i sell a lot of condo units  and somebody from russia buys a condo  who knows   trump said clearly  trump has something to hide that he doesn t want federal investigators to see during an interview with new york magazine  sater said that once he is done testifying and spilling his guts the media will have a lot to talk about  in about the next  to  days  i will be the most colorful character you have ever talked about   sater said   unfortunately  i can t talk about it now  before it happens  and believe me  it ain t anything as small as whether or not they re gonna call me to the senate committee  and sater also understands that what he has to say will probably send him to prison as well  which makes what he has to say all the more interesting because he is willing to go to jail in order to deliver damning testimony against trump according to paul wood of the spectator  for several weeks there have been rumours that sater is ready to rat again  agreeing to help mueller   he has told family and friends he knows he and potus are going to prison   someone talking to mueller s investigators informed me the fact that sater understands that what he says could put him in prison is significant  it means that he is willing to tell the truth about trump even if it means losing his own freedom  short of seeing trump s tax returns  sater may be the next best resource  if anybody knows the vile depths trump has sunk to do business with the russians  it s sater trump has got to be panicking right now because it may not be long before he is arrested  prosecuted and locked away if that happens  trump would be the first president to be indicted and sentenced to jail  his disgracing of the office of the presidency would be complete and total  but at least justice would finally prevail and our nation can finally breathe a sigh of relief let s just hope that mr  sater is serious about doing the right thing featured image via addicting info archive
