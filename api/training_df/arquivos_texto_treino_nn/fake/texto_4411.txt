bill maher had nearly a week to plan how he wanted to lampoon loser donald trump s debate performance against hillary clinton and he did not disappoint during his show on friday night  the real time host opened the show still in disbelief that this is actually happening  but he quickly got over it and moved on to mocking trump s sore loser hissy fit that he has displayed ever since the debate ended  he interrupted her  times   maher said about the debate   at one point she had to say   mommy s talking   he actually had a meltdown  donald trump had a meltdown about what a great temperament he has  it was like watching someone carve  i am not a psycho  into their arm  maher continued by pointing out that the scientifically conducted polls show that hillary won the debate  but trump claims he won and has used every excuse in the book ever since to explain his poor showing  even though all the polls showed that hillary won the debate  oh  he won   maher continued   and even if he didn t win  totally not his fault  the moderator asked the wrong questions  he had a bad microphone  the whole system is rigged  she had the questions beforehand  the sun was in my eyes  the coke wore off  even ryan lochte was like  stop with the bullshit about being robbed  you whiny little b tch  maher then turned to talking about the theory that trump had used cocaine prior to the debate  pointing out that he was  manic  during the first  minutes before crashing and becoming very thirsty while sniffling throughout the night  hillary got a big bump after the debate and trump looked like he did a big bump before the debate  that s what i m hearing  i hope it s not true  a lot of people are saying it  he was stiffing a lot  it was either that or he s allergic to facts ironically  the guy who wants to build a wall hit a wall  maher also slammed trump s attacks on former miss universe alicia machado  quipping that america doesn t need a president answering the  phone call who is already in an  enraged hissy fit  maher then sarcastically thanked the republican party for this mess they created and told them they must be  so fucking proud  your candidate finally takes a concrete position on something and it s  no fat chicks  here s the video via youtube donald trump is an embarrassment  but what s truly embarrassing is that he isn t losing by a landslide  anyone who still supports trump should be ashamed of themselves featured image via creenshot
