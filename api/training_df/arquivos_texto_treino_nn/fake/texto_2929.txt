donald trump delivered his inaugural address on friday  and it was predictably divisive and negative trump portrayed america as a weak  crime ridden wasteland where everyone lives in poverty  mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities  rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential  this american carnage stops right here and stops right now  he also attacked president obama by proclaiming that  january     will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again  called our military  depleted   and railed against america s crumbling infrastructure of course  trump left out the fact that republicans blocked infrastructure spending for eight years  he also failed to point out that republicans have been attacking education for years also  our military is the most funded military in the world  so claiming that it is depleted is a lie and an insult to our troops it should be pointed out that trump contributed to the shuttering of factories in this country by buying raw materials  like metals  from china to build his hotels with instead of buying it from american companies crime is also down  and millions of americans were lifted from poverty over the last eight years because of programs like the affordable care act and minimum wage hikes  both of which trump opposes  we stand at the birth of a new millennium  ready to unlock the mysteries of space  to free the earth from the miseries of disease  and to harness the energies  industries and technologies of tomorrow  trump failed to mention that he wants to cut nasa s budget too  supports the anti vaccination movement  intends to double down on coal and oil to the detriment of clean energy  and is eliminating a government agency dedicated to researching and developing new technologies to reduce carbon dioxide in our atmosphere seriously  trump s speech was totally contradictory to what his administration actually plans to do the inaugural address was a shit show and americans confirmed it on twitter that was like a bad liberal parody of a republican president s inaugural address   jon favreau   jonfavs  january    that  realdonaldtrump is making what sounds like a campaign speech rather than an inaugural address  gavin esler   gavinesler  january    is the most xenophobic inaugural address in us history  edward luce   edwardgluce  january    must have mixed up his speech texts  he s giving a bitter  negative campaign stump speech  not a uniting  soaring inaugural address   nicholas kristof   nickkristof  january    live analysis of donald trump s inaugural address https   t co  pic twitter com   the new york times   nytimes  january    t know what i expected  but that may be the least presidential inaugural address on record   inauguration  misty murphy   mothernerd  january     chucktodd   it was surprisingly divisive for an inaugural address  that wasn t the kind of address intended to bring us all together  mark murray   mmurraypolitics  january    have read every inaugural address  that was the worst   philip collins   pcollinstimes  january    little grace  very protectionist in every sense  very ominous   in short  very trumpian  god help us all https   t co   demfromtx   demfromtx  january    inauguraladdress  forgettable  in every way  except for the pit in the stomach   daryl sneath   dsneath  january    trump makes his intentions very clear with his inaugural address  it s simply  screw you  rest of the world    trumpinauguration  bhargob kakoty   bhargob  january    the shittest inaugural address in a long time  mitchell mccombe     january    s inaugural address  a disgraceful deception https   t co   kip spelling   kipspelling  january     during the inaugural address it started to rain bc like the majority of us god is also crying  zoe   notlowzo  january    trump s speech was full of lies and promises that he won t keep  he is already attacking education by putting a person who wants to destroy it in charge of the education department  and he is slashing the transportation department s budget  trump is also poised to strip healthcare from millions of americans  which will make them poorer and more vulnerable  furthermore  trump is cutting funds from the justice department s civil rights division  which will hurt people of color across the country donald trump doesn t care about america  he only cares about himself and what his gullible supporters think of him featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
