michael flynn drove another nail into the coffin of donald trump s presidency on thursday when he agreed to testify about russia in exchange for immunity  this prompted one member of the house intelligence committee to state the obvious   innocent people don t ask for immunity  speaking to msnbc s chris hayes  rep  eric swalwell  d ca  said what we have all been thinking since the announcement was made that flynn was willing to testify in exchange for immunity  if you didn t do anything wrong  then you don t need immunity  the only reason to seek immunity is to protect yourself from prosecution from the illegal crap you ve done  innocent people don t ask for immunity  but that s not something that i m familiar with in our investigation  if he has something to say and he s not worried about what he did  he should just come forward and testify in a public setting   swalwell added hayes argued that there might be some scenarios where an innocent person would ask for immunity  the msnbc host said that asking for immunity doesn t automatically mean you are guilty of something  what if they are worried about perjury  or concerned that maybe their words could somehow be used against them in some other way  hey  it s possible  right swalwell wasn t having it  he said that prosecutors don t run around seeking perjury charges because somebody had a lapse of memory  but this isn t the case when it comes to flynn  he explained   what we have here is a pattern of deceit with michael flynn  it s not forgetfulness   the congressman replied you can watch the entire interview below  via msnbc featured image via video screen capture
