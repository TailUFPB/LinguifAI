this is the kind of trash donald trump is bringing into the political field when daily beast reporter olivia nuzzi posted a story on her facebook page about the relationship between donald trump and marla maples written by colleague brandy zadrozny  she didn t think it would cause conservatives to lose their shit after all  the piece seems to reveal a trump with a more human side  while expressing admiration for marla maples for the way she put up with his bullshit all those years  regardless  there is no excuse for this kind of response nevertheless  a new jersey republican who clearly has not read the piece nor understood that nuzzi did not write the story herself lashed out by openly replying that he hopes somebody rapes her  preferably a syrian refugee  i hope somebody rapes you today   wrote mike krawitz  a gop candidate running for a seat on the west deptford township committeethis man who wants me to be raped today was a republican candidate for office in nj https   t co  pic twitter com   olivia nuzzi   olivianuzzi  september    s an image of his posts as they appeared on facebook so far  the west deptford gop is failing horribly at handling the matter  they are actually defending krawitz by claiming that his twitter account got hacked  the executive board of the wdgop does not condone any repulsive  threatening  or demeaning rhetoric in any social media form or otherwise   they began   we are in the process of contacting twitter for confirmation that someone hacked his account and posted his facebook thumbnail on the hacked twitter entry  except that krawitz  who is an avid fan of the republican nominee  posted his disgusting attack on facebook  something nuzzi reminded the west deptford gop when she took them to the woodshed over their pathetic response wishing rape upon any woman is despicable and should automatically disqualify the person who said it from seeking political office  but apparently  the gop thinks it s a virtue featured image via facebook
