republicans just keep digging their political graves deeper the affordable care act currently provides health insurance to  million americans  the plans are broader than ever before and people can t be discriminated against just because they have a pre existing condition people who didn t have affordable access to medical care now have it but republicans have been trying to take it away from them for years and are still trying to do so even though americans across the country have made it clear that they support the landmark healthcare law the latest republican to desperately try to justify repealing the affordable care act is kansas rep  roger marshall  who claims the free market provides better and more affordable healthcare while also claiming that poor people don t want healthcare  just like jesus said   the poor will always be with us   marshall told stat news   there is a group of people that just don t want health care and aren t going to take care of themselves  but marshall  like most republicans  is lying as it turns out  people who gained health insurance through medicaid expansion are  in fact  using preventive care services to take care of themselves so saying that poor people don t want healthcare is absolutely ridiculous but marshall continued to insist that poor people don t want to take care of themselves  just  like  homeless people    i think just morally  spiritually  socially   just don t want health care  the medicaid population  which is  a free credit card  as a group  do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising  and i m not judging  i m just saying socially that s where they are  so there s a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought  the er  again  medicaid recipients are using preventive services such as mammograms and cholesterol checks by an increase of  percent and  percent in addition  marshall envisions a healthcare system that only the wealthy can afford  in doing so  he based his vision on the hospital he ran before taking office  our vision was that we would look more like a hotel with customer service that delivered five star health care   he said   so our cafeteria looks more like a coffee shop than it does a sterile hospital dining room  we have bright windows everywhere  and outside of every window there s a garden  thinking that healing is more than just a knife and a needle  the price of a stay at a five star hotel can range well into the hundreds upwards to thousands of dollars per night  hardly something a low income american can afford while marshall argues that free market healthcare is more affordable  the facts paint a far different picture for example  a british couple were on vacation in new york when the woman unexpectedly went into labor  weeks early  she gave birth at a private hospital and was slapped with a    medical bill the same thing happened to a canadian woman who was vacationing in hawaii  only she got slapped with a   million medical bill these are the astronomical prices that republicans like marshall think americans should have to pay  such prices are financially crippling to low income americans  and medical bankruptcy is one of the major reasons why the affordable care act was passed in the first place because while marshall claims that government healthcare is more expensive  had the two women above given birth in their home countries  their care would have been free because canada and england both have national healthcare services paid for through taxes  even a private hospital a england would have only cost the british couple     far lower than the    bill issued by the kind of  five star  american hospital marshall thinks should be the future of healthcare in short  republicans don t think poor people should get access to affordable healthcare  they think healthcare is for rich people  that s morally repugnant and is exactly why republicans should be ousted from office en masse in   this country needs a healthcare system that works for everyone  republicans are content with just letting people die featured image via flickr
