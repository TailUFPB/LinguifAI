texas landowners along the u s  mexico border have begun receiving notices from the federal government saying that they re coming to either buy  or take  parcels of land for trump s pointless border wall  according to the texas observer  landowners are receiving  declarations of taking  notices that offer a price for the piece that the government wants  if the landowners refuse that  then they may see those parts of their property taken via eminent domain one landowner  yvette salinas  got her notice back in january  she d been dreading it for a while because of george w  bush s focus on a border fence  under obama  she d been able to relax a bit because he focused on patrolling and monitoring the border in ways that didn t include taking land and building a wall now  with trump in office  this shit has just gotten real  whether any of these preparations happened while obama was still in office or not  it s trump who is pushing the wall forward as quickly as he can  it s one of his focal points  and it will be his government that buys up or takes the land the introduction in salinas  letter reads like this  the united states of america is acquiring property along its border with mexico in order to construct a fence and related improvements designed to secure the border  as required by the secure fence act of   they offered salinas and her family    for   acres of land   the same amount for the same land that the government offered her under george w  bush years earlier  the tiny community in which she lives los ebanos lies entirely within the floodplain of the rio grande  that land is protected by a treaty with mexico that forbids the building of structures that could force floodwaters into other communities  and has been an obstacle towards border wall construction under trump  though  los ebanos seems to have become a focal point  the government has already completed surveys and planning for a wall there  despite increasing problems with costs  the fact that crossings are down  and the fact that republicans are voicing their discomfort with the idea  trump keeps hammering the wall as the way to secure the border it s impossibly stupid  people who live along the border prefer the technological surveillance and the presence of the u s  border patrol to a wall because they believe that s more effective and costs a hell of a lot less  and they don t have to give up pieces of land that have been in their families for generations for that they also know people will still cross whether there s a wall or not salinas doesn t want to sell that bit of land but she doesn t know what to do  the community doesn t want to allow the wall to be built through there  either  but neither can they afford to have the u s  government sue them  and they risk having their land taken without compensation if they try to fight featured image by erik s  lesser via getty images
