all donald trump did is unload some play doh for a photo op in flood ravaged louisiana instead of doing anything tangible to help  and he just got shredded for it trump traveled to the state this week in order to boast that he somehow cares about the flood victims because president obama and hillary clinton have yet to make the trip down  however  that s only because louisiana governor john bel edwards asked them not to come because first responders are still rescuing people and their arrival would only divert effort and resources away from those who need it trump  however  doesn t care about anyone but himself so he visited anyway  edwards said that trump is welcome but he has to volunteer or write a check to help victims but trump barely did anything at all  and he certainly didn t write a check neva butkus is a relief worker who has been on the ground in louisiana working hard to help those in need  and when she found out about trump s visit she ripped him a new one on facebook for exploiting people who are hurting in a desperate attempt to save his imploding campaign  alright  y all  i need to clear some things up as a baton rouge resident who  has spent this entire week running donation centers  organizing volunteer efforts  and will be doing demo work on houses all this weekend   butkus began  our governor has explicitly asked obama to not visit at this moment because our first responders are still saving people s lives  yes  it has been a week and there is still standing water  tens of thousands of people are displaced  this is a nightmare and our governor does not want to shut down interstates that are bringing in supplies just to escort our president into the city  butkus pointed out that donald trump visited a republican part of the state so that it would look like he is welcome there in the midst of the natural disaster going on   he is exploiting an opportunity to look as if he is welcomed during a tragedy   she said  our governor literally told him   she continued   that trump is welcome in our state but if he s coming he better be volunteering or writing a sizable check to assist with recovery  a  second video of him unloading play doh from a truck does not count  indeed  one would think he would at least get a photo op of himself unloading food or water or something  that s a trump fail on a spectacular level and then butkus really lit trump up  trump  seriously  where is the check  like where is the fucking check  my people are drowning  my co workers and family and friends have lost everything  my friends and co workers that haven t lost everything are taking off work  my boyfriend is taking pto  to clean out people s homes and rip out sheet rock and carpet  give us money or gtfo  i don t want to see you in your suit in august carrying boxes off a truck like you care about us  louisiana is an incredible place  baton rouge is my home and i have watched people drop everything to help one another during this time  the whole country seems to be floored by the generosity and love that our residents show each other during tough times  but to us this is normal  this is louisiana  and you do not belong here  here s a screenshot of the full facebook smackdown donald trump should be ashamed of himself for exploiting a tragedy to make himself look good  and republicans should be embarrassed for letting him  president obama s presence in louisiana would not have done anything to help those in need of assistance  and in the end  donald trump s presence did nothing except distract from the rescue and recovery effort that should have been the focus  but as usual  trump only cares about himself featured image  screenshot
