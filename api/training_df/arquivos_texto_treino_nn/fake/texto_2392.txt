donald trump and his team are desperate to cover up and stop the reporting of the fbi s investigations into trump s russia ties  and they just made a major mistake while trying to control the media earlier today during the annual conservative political action conference  cpac   trump railed against the media in a bizarre rant  just hours after trump spoke  the white house decided to take this hostility one step further and banned certain media outlets that trump had taken issue with from a press gaggle  there were several others such as the new york times and buzzfeed  but the most predictable network that was shunned was none other than cnn  who trump has often referred to as  fake news  in response  cnn put out a public statement calling the trump administration s behavior  unacceptable  and the network wasn t done  cnn s jake tapper weighed in on the white house s actions and tore into trump  he said  this white house doesn t value an independent press  there s a word for that line of thinking  the word is un american  you can watch tapper s brilliant takedown of trump below tapper couldn t have been more correct  and he s perfectly demonstrating how the media should be responding to trump  tapper didn t attempt to sugarcoat anything and brilliantly called trump out for trying to run america like a dictatorship trump and his team have done everything they can to distract from their wrongdoings  and it s all coming to a head now  they are trying to discredit the country s free press and create distrust with american citizens so that trump and his minions can continue to get away with their scandals  americans need to stand by the media and continue to pay attention whenever trump tried to pull a disgusting stunt like this one  it s really our only chance against such a dishonest administration featured image via screenshot and pool   getty images
