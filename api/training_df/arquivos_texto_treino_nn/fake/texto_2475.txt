congressman hakeem jeffries says that  while he would welcome an opportunity for donald trump to sit down with the congressional black caucus  he does not think steve bannon should be present  why  because of the obvious  he s a  stone cold racist  during an interview with msnbc on friday  jeffries told katy tur that the cbc has reached out to trump about meeting with him  actually  they did so on january   the day before he was sworn into office  they would like nothing more than for him to prove that his commitment to working with minority communities is real however  jeffries did say that trump s reaction to a black reporter who asked him about meeting with the cbc during a press conference was  strange    for the record  that isn t the word i would use  but i digress   regardless  jeffries said  the cbc is still  looking forward to an open dialogue  but that feeling does not extend to bannon  trump s white supremacist adviser  steve bannon should not be in the room  he s a stone cold racist and a white supremacist sympathizer  it would be hard for me to participate in any meeting with steve bannon that normalizes his presence in the white house  beyond that  we ll have to see  jeffries and the cbc are hoping that they can work with trump to address issues facing black america  but working with a white supremacist is just asking too much watch the interview here  via msnbc featured image via video screen capture
