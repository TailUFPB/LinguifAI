donald trump s attorney jay sekulow made a fool of himself on tuesday morning during an interview with abc host george stephanopoulos  sekulow actually claimed that collusion is not a crime in an effort to defend trump after his associate george papadopoulos plead guilty to lying to fbi agents about meeting with russians  he was a volunteer with the campaign  he served on one of the committees   sekelow said   he was involved with individuals that purported to be somehow involved with russia or russian government   it s not clear from the documents  the end result is the meeting doesn t take place  so what you had is you had all this conversation about collusion  remember this  collusion in and of itself   there s no crime of collusion  even stephanopoulos knew that claim was bullshit  collusion is cooperation and that s what he was doing with russians   stephanopoulos replied here s the video via youtube indeed  collusion is just another word for  conspiracy   which is a crime  a major crime sekulow s claim was immediately debunked by prominent members of the legal community harvard university law professor john coates and university of california  irvine law professor rick hasen schooled sekulow  it is a federal crime to conspire with anyone  including a foreign government  to  deprive another of the intangible right of honest services   coates told politifact after fox news host eric bolling made the same claim in july   that would include fixing a fraudulent election  in my view  within the plain meaning of the statute  if others participated in the scheme to do this it could be a conspiracy   hasen added   whether you want to call that  collusion  or not seems besides the point  in short  trump s own attorney doesn t understand the law and apparently thinks that the use of the word  collusion  absolves trump and his campaign team of any crimes  but that s simply not the case and any self respecting judge would laugh at sekulow in open court if he tried to use such a defense featured image  win mcnamee getty images
