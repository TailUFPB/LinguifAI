donald trump spent monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate  we were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight  and it was quite the spectacle  from lies to self incrimination  watching the gop nominee s performance was the equivalent of one facepalm after another so here you go  a complete list of every batshit crazy thing that came out of donald trump s mouth during the first presidential debate  there s nobody in our government to fight them   and we have a very good fight  and we have a winning fight  they re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thing  we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies  our country s in deep trouble   we don t know what we re doing with devaluations  especially when it comes to china  they re the best   they re the best ever at it  what they re doing to us is a very very sad thing  that s called business  by the way    referring to making money off of the  financial collapse  i m a great believer in all forms of energy  our country is losing a so much in terms of energy  in terms of paying off our debt  i will bring back jobs   you can t bring back jobs  that s about all you ve got    referring to clinton s book we are stronger together  you are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history   you are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history   you are going to drive businesses out  i m going to cut taxes  big league   you are going to raise taxes  big league  and take a look at mine also    referring to his campaign website  she tells us how to fight isis on her website   i don t think douglas macarthur would like that too much  you re telling the enemy everything you want to do   no wonder you ve been fighting isis your entire adult life  well  i m really calling for major jobs  because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs   they re going to expand their companies   they re going to do a tremendous job    hahahaha  i m getting rid of the carried interest provision  and if you really look  it s really not a great thing for the wealthy  it s really a great thing for middle class    methinks thou dost protest too much  these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies   and when they re going to bring   trillion dollars back from overseas  where they can t bring the money back because politicians like secretary clinton won t allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad    or because those companies are greedy and un american  just saying  so  what they re doing is leaving our country  and believe it or not  they re leaving our country because the taxes are too high   because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country  and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they can t work out a deal   and everybody agrees it should be brought back  instead of that they re leaving our country to get their money because they can t bring their money back into our country  because of bureacratic red tape   because they can t get together  because we have a president that can t sit them around a table  and get them to approve something     maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we don t need to cut valuable public services  we have no leadership  and honestly  that starts with secretary clinton  why not   we re in a bubble right now  and the only thing that looks good is the stock market  we have a fed that is doing political things  the fed is being more political than secretary clinton when we have a country that s doing so badly  that s being ripped off by every single country in the world  it s the kind of thinking that our country needs  we have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals    in response to a question about his taxes  i ve been under audit for almost  years   i know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited   i say   have you been audited    i get audited almost every year  and in a way i should be complaining   i m not even complaining   i don t mind it   it s almost become a way of life   i get audited by the irs  but other people don t  we have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of   i will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishes that makes me smart    in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes  i could give you a list of banks  if that would help you   i would give you a list of banks   these are very fine institutions  very fine banks   i could do that very quickly  i have a tremendous income   the reason i say that is not in a braggadocios way  it s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money  our airports are like from a third world country  we ve become a third world country   the worst of all things has happened  and it s really a shame  and it s politicians like secretary clinton that have caused this problem  our country has tremendous problems  we re a debtor nation  we re a serious debtor nation  and we have a country that needs new roads  new tunnels  new bridges  new airports  new schools  new hospitals  and we don t have the money  because it s been squandered on so many of your ideas  it would be squandered  too  believe me    in response to not paying any federal income taxes  maybe he didn t do a good job and i was unsatisfied with his work  which our country should do  too    referring to not paying people who worked for him  but on occasion  four times  we used certain laws that are there  and when secretary clinton talks about people that didn t get paid  first of all  they did get paid a lot  but taken advantage of the laws of the nation   now  if you want to change the laws  you ve been there a long time  change the laws  but i take advantage of the laws of the nation because i m running a company  my obligation right now is to do well for myself  my family  my employees  for my companies  and that s what i do    referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts  but what she doesn t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me  i ll give you an example  we re just opening up on pennsylvania avenue right next to the white house  so if i don t get there one way  i m going to get to pennsylvania avenue another  when we look at the budget  the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy  well  first of all  secretary clinton doesn t want to use a couple of words  and that s law and order  and we need law and order  if we don t have it  we re not going to have a country  now  whether or not in a place like chicago you do stop and frisk  which worked very well  mayor giuliani is here  worked very well in new york  we have to be   we have to know what we re doing  right now  our police  in many cases  are afraid to do anything  no  you re wrong  it went before a judge  who was a very against police judge  it was taken away from her  and our mayor  our new mayor  refused to go forward with the case  they would have won an appeal  if you look at it  throughout the country  there are many places where it s allowed    referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional  we need law and order  and we need law and order in the inner cities  because the people that are most affected by what s happening are african american and hispanic people  and it s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen  i have the endorsement of the nra  which i m very proud of  these are very  very good people  but i think we have to look very strongly at no fly lists and watch lists  and when people are on there  even if they shouldn t be on there  we ll help them  we ll help them legally  we ll help them get off  but i tend to agree with that quite strongly  but stop and  frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city  tremendous beyond belief  so when you say it has no impact  it really did  it had a very  very big impact  they ve been abused and used in order to get votes by democrat politicians  because that s what it is  they ve controlled these communities for up to  years  you know  you ve seen me  i ve been all over the place  you decided to stay home  and that s ok  but i will tell you  i ve been all over  and i ve met some of the greatest people i ll ever meet within these communities  when i got involved  i didn t fail  i got him to give the birth certificate  so i m satisfied with it  and i ll tell you why i m satisfied with it but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate  and i think i did a good job well  it was very   i say nothing  i say nothing  because i was able to get him to produce it  he should have produced it a long time before  i say nothing  but let me just tell you  when you talk about healing  i think that i ve developed very  very good relationships over the last little while with the african american community  i think you can see that   and i feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion and i think i did a great job and a great service not only for the country  but even for the president  in getting him to produce his birth certificate  first of all  i got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against barack obama  you treated him with terrible disrespect   and i watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are  it doesn t work that way  you were after him  now  as far as the lawsuit  yes  when i was very young  i went into my father s company  had a real estate company in brooklyn and queens  and we  along with many  many other companies throughout the country   it was a federal lawsuit   were sued  we settled the suit with zero   with no admission of guilt  it was very easy to do  and  you know  i also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways  which i don t do on you  maybe i m trying to save the money  but  frankly  i look   i look at that  and i say  isn t that amazing  because i settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt  but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms  and it s just one of those things  i ll go one step further  in palm beach  florida  tough community  a brilliant community  a wealthy community  probably the wealthiest community there is in the world  i opened a club  and really got great credit for it  no discrimination against african  americans  against muslims  against anybody  and it s a tremendously successful club  and i m so glad i did it  and i have been given great credit for what i did  and i m very  very proud of it  and that s the way i feel  that is the true way i feel  in addition  i was just endorsed by ice  they ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration  i was just endorsed by ice  as far as the cyber  i agree to parts of what secretary clinton said  we should be better than anybody else  and perhaps we re not  i don t think anybody knows it was russia that broke into the dnc  she s saying russia  russia  russia  but i don t   maybe it was  i mean  it could be russia  but it could also be china  it could also be lots of other people  it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs  pounds  ok  now  whether that was russia  whether that was china  whether it was another country  we don t know  because the truth is  under president obama we ve lost control of things that we used to have control over  we came in with the internet  we came up with the internet  and i think secretary clinton and myself would agree very much  when you look at what isis is doing with the internet  they re beating us at our own game  isis  so we have to get very  very tough on cyber and cyber warfare  it is   it is a huge problem  i have a son  he s  years old  he has computers  he is so good with these computers  it s unbelievable  the security aspect of cyber is very  very tough  and maybe it s hardly doable  but i will say  we are not doing the job we should be doing  but that s true throughout our whole governmental society  we have so many things that we have to do better and certainly cyber is one of them  so she talks about taking them out  she s been doing it a long time  she s been trying to take them out for a long time  but they wouldn t have even been formed if they left some troops behind  like   or maybe something more than that  and then you wouldn t have had them    speaking about the creation of isis  or  as i ve been saying for a long time  and i think you ll agree  because i said it to you once  had we taken the oil   and we should have taken the oil   isis would not have been able to form either  because the oil was their primary source of income  and now they have the oil all over the place  including the oil   a lot of the oil in libya  wrong  wrong   wrong  the secretary said very strongly about working with   we ve been working with them for many years  and we have the greatest mess anyone s ever seen  but you look at the middle east  you started the iran deal  that s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall  i mean  they were doing so badly  they were choking on the sanctions  and now they re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon  the way they re going  number one  the  countries of nato  many of them aren t paying their fair share  number two   and that bothers me  because we should be asking   we re defending them  and they should at least be paying us what they re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract  and  number two  i said  and very strongly  nato could be obsolete  because   and i was very strong on this  and it was actually covered very accurately in the new york times  which is unusual for the new york times  to be honest   but i said  they do not focus on terror  and i was very strong  and i said it numerous times  and about four months ago  i read on the front page of the wall street journal that nato is opening up a major terror division  and i think that s great  and i think we should get   because we pay approximately  percent of the cost of nato  it s a lot of money to protect other people  but i m all for nato  but i said they have to focus on terror  also   and they re going to do that  and that was   believe me   i m sure i m not going to get credit for it   but that was largely because of what i was saying and my criticism of nato  and believe me  you were the ones that took out the troops  not only that  you named the day  they couldn t believe it  they sat back probably and said  i can t believe it  but you were there  and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant  now it s in over  countries  and you re going to stop them  i don t think so  that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her  because she   frankly  i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media  well  i have much better judgment than she does  there s no question about that  i also have a much better temperament than she has  you know  i have a much better   she spent   let me tell you   she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising   you know  they get madison avenue into a room  they put names   oh  temperament  let s go after   i think my strongest asset  maybe by far  is my temperament  i have a winning temperament  i know how to win  she does not have a wait  the afl cio the other day  behind the blue screen  i don t know who you were talking to  secretary clinton  but you were totally out of control  i said  there s a person with a temperament that s got a problem  wrong  it s lies that line s getting a little bit old  i must say  i would like to it s not an accurate one at all  it s not an accurate one  so i just want to give a lot of things   and just to respond  i agree with her on one thing  the single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament  nuclear weapons  not global warming  like you think and your   your president thinks   nuclear is the single greatest threat  just to go down the list  we defend japan  we defend germany  we defend south korea  we defend saudi arabia  we defend countries  they do not pay us  but they should be paying us  because we are providing tremendous service and we re losing a fortune  that s why we re losing   we re losing   we lose on everything  i say  who makes these   we lose on everything  all i said  that it s very possible that if they don t pay a fair share  because this isn t  years ago where we could do what we re doing  we can t defend japan  a behemoth  selling us cars by the million  all i said was  they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out  we re a country that owes   trillion  they have to help us out  well  i have to say that  you know  for what secretary clinton was saying about nuclear with russia  she s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries  but russia has been expanding their   they have a much newer capability than we do  we have not been updating from the new standpoint  we are not   we are not keeping up with other countries  i would like everybody to end it  just get rid of it  but i would certainly not do first strike  i think that once the nuclear alternative happens  it s over  at the same time  we have to be prepared  i can t take anything off the table  because you look at some of these countries  you look at north korea  we re doing nothing there  china should solve that problem for us  china should go into north korea  china is totally powerful as it relates to north korea  why didn t you add other things into the deal  one of the great giveaways of all time  of all time  including   million in cash  nobody s ever seen that before  that turned out to be wrong  it was actually    billion in cash  obviously  i guess for the hostages  it certainly looks that way   so you say to yourself  why didn t they make the right deal  this is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history  and they re going to end up getting nuclear  i met with bibi netanyahu the other day  believe me  he s not a happy camper  but i will tell you that hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat isis  which she could have defeated by never having it  you know  get going in the first place  right now  it s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them  because they re in more and more places  more and more states  more and more nations  and she doesn t say that  because she s got no business ability  we need heart  we need a lot of things  but you have to have some basic ability  and sadly  she doesn t have that  all you have to do is speak to them  wait  you have so many different things you have to be able to do  and i don t believe that hillary has the stamina  the world   let me tell you  let me tell you  hillary has experience  but it s bad experience  we have made so many bad deals during the last   so she s got experience  that i agree   but it s bad  bad experience  i never said that  i didn t say that  where did you find this   oh  really  you know  hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials  some of it s said in entertainment  some of it s said   somebody who s been very vicious to me  rosie o donnell  i said very tough things to her  and i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her  but you want to know the truth   i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary  to her family  and i said to myself   i can t do it  i just can t do it  it s inappropriate  it s not nice  wow  in hindsight  it would have probably been easier to list the things trump said that weren t completely and utterly ridiculous  when it finally came time to face off with hillary clinton on the debate stage  trump failed miserably and totally embarrassed himself  as hillary said monday night  donald  lives in his own reality   presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense featured image via win mcnamee getty images
