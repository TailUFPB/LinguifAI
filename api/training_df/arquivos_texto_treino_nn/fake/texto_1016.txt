donald trump rode into the presidency with all the political savvy  intellectual curiosity and diplomatic skills of a bully who s about to repeat the  grade  for many of his supporters  many of whom presumably were bullies who had to repeat  grade  that s exactly his appeal  so why should it surprise anyone that trump has managed to offend ally after ally while in office  that s what he was elected to do still  nothing in trump s first   and counting  days in office seems intentional  on some level  he seems to want to be a diplomat  if for no other reason than to have a legacy  but every single time he tries  he falls flat on his corpulent face just last week  for example  trump sent his son in law  jared kushner to try to negotiate peace between israel and palestine  it went about as well as you d imagine  kushner  who is orthodox jewish ad a family friend of israel s prime minister benjamin netanyahu  met with palestinian leader mahmoud abbas  and according to palestinians  came armed only with a list of israeli demands of course  palestine was far from the first diplomatic blunder of the trump administration  here s a list of all the countries  most of whom are allies  that trump has offended mexico almost didn t make this list because  well  trump ran on a campaign of hatred for all things mexican  except for the cheap labor that makes his cheap ties and suits   his first campaign promise was to build a wall along the mexican border  but a feud between trump and mexico s president enrique pe a nieto has turned into somewhat of a regular fixture in the twitterspere one of trump s very first moves in office included a phone call to australia s prime minister  malcolm turnbull  after a heated discussion about syrian refugees  trump hung up on the world leader trump s entire schtick is about creating fear in the hearts and minds of his voters  so much so that he has been known to make up events just to convince people the world is a scary place  in february  he made up a terror attack in sweden during a rally in florida  yes  the man who won the electoral college in november and who has innumerable better things to do is still holding campaign style rallies throughout the country   you look at what s happening in germany  you look at what s happening last night in sweden  sweden  who would believe this  sweden  they took in large numbers  they re having problems like they never thought possiblenothing had happened the night before in sweden donald trump has a complicated relationship with smart  powerful women   especially if they aren t leggy  blonde and share his dna  his relationship with germany s chancellor  angela merkel began badly in march  when trump famously refused to shake her hand  that was only the beginning  read on for more in april  trump hosted the chinese president xi jinping for dinner at trump s mar a lago resort in florida  while the men were enjoying  the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you ve ever seen   trump revealed that he was lobbing missiles at iraq syria  while this wasn t really an insult  it did show president xi that trump couldn t be trusted to keep secrets  before that  though  trump often referred to china as a  currently manipulator  after he took office  trump accepted a congratulatory call from taiwan  this was a clear violation of u s  foreign policy  taiwan as part of china if there is a single ally that nearly every trump supporter can get behind  it s israel  while trump s relationship with israel is not too bad  at least compared to much of the world  one of perhaps his biggest international blunders came when he traded israeli secrets with russians  oh  and there was also the time trump told israelis  while in israel  that he  just got back from the middle east   israel  of course  is in the middle east trump shoved the prime minister so he could get to the front of a photo op not satisfied with offending just one country at a time  trump took on all the european allies by calling them nato deadbeats  he singled out germany by calling them  bad  very bad   because americans love to buy their cars  he insulted europe in general by telling them that it s too hard to build golf courses there for trump  offending our neighbor to the south isn t enough  he s had a long running feud with canada s prime minister justin trudeau  who is trump s political superior in nearly every way imaginable  in may  trump referred to trudeau as  justin from canada  trump refers to trudeau as  justin from canada  https   t co

critical of london mayor sadiq khan s handling of terror attacks in london  khan responded by asking that trump s upcoming state visit be cancelled donald trump s retreat from the paris climate accord was perhaps his most offensive diplomatic move to date  there are only two countries that did not sign on to the agreement  syria and nicaragua  the first because they are in the middle of a civil war and the second because the agreement doesn t go far enough  trump did it to appease his climate denier base  the world will be a dirtier place because of it featured image via pool getty images
