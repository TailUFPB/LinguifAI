once new jersey governor chris christie was defeated while running as a republican candidate in the  election  he quickly kissed up to donald trump and became one of the disgraceful potus  biggest advocates  judging from how christie has conducted himself over the last few days  he still admires the hell out of trump people have been furious with christie recently  after photos surfaced of him enjoying a new jersey beach with his family   a luxury that wasn t afforded to any other new jersey resident  why not  because christie decided to shut down several state parks  beaches  and more over the fourth of july weekend due to a budget stalemate that christie was a major part of in an interview on monday with good day philadelphia  christie responded to all of the backlash he s received for enjoying a beach that was closed to everyone else  his response could have been written by trump himself  he simply said  i m sorry they re not the governor  over the weekend  christie had a similar moronic response to his use of the beach house where he was photographed  that s the way it goes  run for governor  and you can have the residence  heartless  disrespectful  and despicable   and extremely close to something trump had said recently when he went off the rails at a rally to honor veterans  trashing the media  trump said  i m the president  and they re not  this really isn t a good look for christie  after all  his approval rating in his final six months in office is pathetically low  at     which is another thing he has in common with the disturbingly unpopular trump voters have been so outraged over this  it s safe to say that christie won t be new jersey s governor for long  hopefully  we can say the same for trump featured image via joe raedle getty images
