the rachel maddow show has become a hit among cable news viewers  with more than double the number of people tuning in  maddow herself recently revealed her secret to successfully covering donald trump  treat him like a silent movie  we developed sort of an informal  internal mantra  which is that we basically cover them as if they are a silent movie   maddow explained  i stopped covering the twitter feed and we started covering only what they do rather than what they say  without a doubt  she s doing something right  the wrap reports that in february  maddow had the  largest total viewer audience ever in the  p m  et timeslot   but her success isn t limited to just one month  she has also  beaten cnn s regularly scheduled programming for  straight months   and  gained  percent in total viewers compared to february    during the same time period  cnn gained only  percent and fox news increased by a measly  percent  it is an unusual thing that the white house and its chief spokespeople have been called out saying stuff that s not true over and over and over again   she said   it s the petty stuff but it s also important stuff that they ve not told the truth about  maddow explains that lies have consequences  once you prove yourself as untrustworthy  you words no longer have any real meaning   we no longer go to that person for factual information   maddow said  once she realized that these people could no longer be trusted  she came up with a new game plan for covering the trump administration  i really feel like it was helpful to me  in terms of trying to come up with what to talk about every day  and serving up information for our audience that is substantive and not manipulated by people at the white house   maddow said   it was helpful for us to just stop paying attention to what they were saying  maddow said that kellyanne conway might be a nice person   but as her fellow msnbc host mika brzezinski recently pointed out  she s just not credible anymore   maddow added that conversations with her  and most of trump s other surrogates  are  essentially just talking to a pro trump political operative  rather than actually speaking to a white house representative it seems that maddow has done what the majority of the media is still struggling to do  she has figured out how to cover trump and the secret is simple  focus only on what they do  not what they say because it s probably a lie anyway featured image via video screen capture
