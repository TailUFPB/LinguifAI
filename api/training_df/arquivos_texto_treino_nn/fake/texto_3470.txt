as news that the cia had solid evidence that russia did indeed meddle in our election  possibly to the point of influencing the results  it also came out that our senate majority leader was actively working to prevent that information from coming out  he basically said that he d accuse the white house of playing partisan politics if they went public and challenged russia our intelligence community actually identified individual people  with connections to the russian government  who gave wikileaks thousands of emails hacked from both the dnc and john podesta  hillary s campaign chairman  they re part of a bigger russian plot to harm hillary  and get trump elected  according to the intelligence community  intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the russian government who provided wikileaks with thousands of hacked emails from the democratic national committee and others  including hillary clinton s campaign chairman  according to u s  officials  those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider russian operation to boost trump and hurt clinton s chances  sounds conspiracy theorish  doesn t it  this kind of thing is the stuff that the right wing conspiracy theorists spin out of nothing  the only difference is that our intelligence officials actually know this is happening  rather than the conspiracy theorists making up their own info in the face of official truth there is a legitimate concern about making the strain on our relationship with russia worse than it is  however  that s not what mcconnell seemed worried about back in september when this information first began coming to light  at the time  the white house had been looking for broad  bipartisan support from congressional leaders in coming out with the information  they were worried about looking like they were  in fact  playing politics mcconnell  however  decided to threaten the white house with that accusation regardless  the democratic leaders in the room unanimously agreed on the need to take the threat seriously  republicans  however  were divided  with at least two gop lawmakers reluctant to accede to the white house requests according to several officials  mcconnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the white house to challenge the russians publicly an act of partisan politics  he did not want this information getting out  although why is anybody s guess  we know that the rnc was hacked as well  but whatever those hacks discovered was never released  we now have high confidence that they hacked the d n c  and the r n c   and conspicuously released no documents  from the republican organization  one senior administration official said  referring to the russians  why  it raises all sorts of questions  including whether mcconnell had an idea about that and was afraid of the gop looking like they were actively working with russia to secure a trump presidency  with this information  mcconnell looks almost like a russian pawn  whether he actually is or not featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
