the washington post just came out with an explosive report about the extremist candidate that alabama is running for the united states senate  roy moore  this is a man who has said that homosexuality should be illegal  got removed from the alabama supreme court twice for defying the united states supreme court   once over a giant monument of the ten commandments he refused to remove from the courthouse  and once for defying the obergefell v  hodges ruling that legalized same sex marriage   and has always made incendiary and bigoted statements that are out of the mainstream even for the republican party  now  it has come out that moore molested a  year old girl when he was in his  s now  one would think that this would be a bridge too far for anyone   especially the types of people who make entire political careers out of trying to legislate what goes on in other people s bedrooms on the basis of their twisted version of  morality   but no  at least one alabama republican is defending moore s actions  and he is using the bible to do it  alabama state auditor jim ziegler says of what moore allegedly did take the bible  zachariah and elizabeth for instance  zachariah was extremely old to marry elizabeth and they became the parents of john the baptist  also take joseph and mary  mary was a teenager and joseph was an adult carpenter  they became parents of jesus  so  let me get this straight  this guy is saying that what moore did is a okay because jesus  this is insane  even for republicans  newsflash  mr  ziegler  roy moore is no joseph from the bible  and that young girl is no mary  further  it is absolutely absurd to suggest that a myth from a   year old holy text is some kind of justification for modern day pedophilia i swear  these people will do anything to win  then again  they elected trump  so all bets are off these days  here s yet another reason to make sure we take back congress in   democrats  let s bring some decency back to washington featured image via scott olson getty images
