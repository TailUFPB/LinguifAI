republicans should be downright afraid to try killing obamacare ever again as we all know  donald trump has been urging republicans in congress to pass legislation that would strip healthcare from over  million americans not only do trump and his republican allies want to kill obamacare  they want to end medicaid as we know it  indeed  medicaid would become a death panel where the state would decide what kind of healthcare people get as trump s effort to kill obamacare gets more desperate  the landmark healthcare program gets more popular  enough so  that a few republicans have broken ranks to oppose repeal in fact  medicaid expansion is so popular that maine voters overruled governor paul lepage s veto on tuesday via the ballot according to reuters tuesday s ballot asked maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverageunder medicaid for adults under the age of  with incomes at or below  percent of the federal poverty level  which in  is about    for a single person and about    for a family of two and  percent of maine voters approved  clearly rejecting lepage s and trump s efforts to kill medicaid and obamacare   mainers will now be eligible for medicaid coverage and will get the healthcare they need and deserve this is huge because maine is often considered politically independent to conservative leaning  meaning that republicans would be better off abandoning their war on healthcare if they don t  voters across the country will go to the ballot box and replace them with lawmakers who actually give a damn about them and their health and trump could be on the path to being a one term president  assuming he isn t impeached or arrested before  and he ll have no one to blame but himself  because people don t like it when politicians try to kill them featured image  white house photo by pete souza
