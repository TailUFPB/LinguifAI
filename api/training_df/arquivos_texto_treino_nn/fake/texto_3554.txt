with donald trump throwing yet another hissy fit on twitter for how saturday night live depicts him   it has left many going after him for being such a whining baby about it all  and the ladies of the view are no different the general consensus about trump s twitter tantrums is that instead of focusing on how a comedy show satirizes him  he should focus on the nation he was just elected to lead  albeit only through the electoral college because he lost to hillary clinton by   million votes many on the panel noticed that trump seems very insecure  probably because he won the election so narrowly and didn t get the popular vote  and now he s overcompensating with aggression on twitter here s the thing  political satire is necessary  especially to keep people in power in check and make them see how ridiculous they can be sometimes  if trump doesn t like a mirror being held up to how he behaves  maybe he should look at himself and not the people pointing it out these opinions from the view panel are likely how most of america feels right now  so well done watch the ladies go after trump here   jedediahbila on trump s twitter rant against snl   could you just laugh a little bit   pic twitter com   the view   theview  december    video via video screen capture
