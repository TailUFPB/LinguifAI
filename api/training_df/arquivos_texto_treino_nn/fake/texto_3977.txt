what many people have been predicting throughout the course of this election may be starting to come to fruition  but it s still early  so nothing is for certain what s that prediction  that republicans help hillary clinton win by voting for her over donald trump according to targetsmart  who is known for their political data  clinton has an eight point lead in florida among early voters breaking   targetsmart  williamandmary fl poll  hrc    djt  voters from fl sos      voters  haven t voted yet       targetsmart   targetsmart  november    bonier  targetsmart ceo  appeared on the last word with lawrence o donnell on msnbc to share the news of this polling  the most surprising finding being that clinton has   of registered republican voters voting for her bonier said  we see this race as an eight point spread in favor of secretary clinton     which really is challenging the conventional wisdom of what we ve seen so far  i will say  in what we re seeing  as been noted on your show and elsewhere on the network  a lot of the vote in florida has already been cast and elsewhere  as of this morning  over   million votes have been cast  and so  what s unique about this survey is our ability to actually poll people who have voted and see where they are  there s been a lot of analysis of who s voted by party  but really no sense given of how they re voting really what s fueling  honestly  this somewhat surprising eight percent margin for secretary clinton is the fact that she s performing incredibly strongly with registered republican voters  so  what we re seeing in this survey is winning   of registered republicans who have already cast a ballot in florida  this certainly doesn t look too good for trump  but it s still early and the election is still a week a way  so who s really to know  but it s definitely looking good for clinton thus far  watch here   of gop early voters in florida voted for  hillaryclinton   she has an  point lead in early voting  imwithher  lastword pic twitter com   khary penebaker   kharyp  november    photo by drew angerer getty images
