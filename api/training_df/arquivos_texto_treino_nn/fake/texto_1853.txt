unless you ve been living under a rock for the past few days  you now know that our idiot wannabe  president  just used military resources and spent god knows how many millions of taxpayer dollars just to put on a little show in syria that  instead of making him look good  embarrassed america and pissed off most of the world  it might even have pissed off russia  though we re still of the belief that putin was in on this whole scheme before trump fake attacked syria late thursday night  he warned his bff putin  who in turn  warned his allies in syria  who then evacuated the base and surrounding areas  sadly   innocent civilians were killed in this needless  unforgivable display  among them  women and children from a local village  the same women and children that he stood at his podium thursday  chest puffed out  promising to protect  sorry  asshole   your little publicity stunt backfired and you will have to answer for that one day   the sooner the better what makes this whole f cked up situation even more disgusting is that journalists all over have been ignoring the obvious   trump did this as a distraction from investigations into his collusion with russia and to gain support to boost his record low poll numbers   and they are actually praising him for this act  one of these journalists  shockingly  was cnn host fareed zakaria who went on cnn s new day and said the unthinkable  i think donald trump became president of the united states last night  i think this was actually a big moment  after watching his fellow journalists essentially roll over and cave to whatever mystical powers trump seems to have over the people who support him  one famed and beloved journalist wasn t having it  dan rather took to facebook friday with a scathing post that ripped those journalists  and especially donald trump  to shreds  to trump  he had this to say the president of the united states is the commander in chief  it is an awesome responsibility  committing the use of force and american men and women in uniform is about as serious as it gets  but the truly great presidents understand that knowing when not to act is as important as knowing when to act it is a whole lot easier starting wars than finishing them  and there are many historical examples of where a promise of limited engagement quickly metastasized into something much bigger there is a tendency to rally around the flag  and a president who takes on a war footing can see a boost of support  it is often transitory  there are arguments to be made that president assad in syria has crossed a line that demands u s  military interference  whether this should have been a unilateral action is something we all must consider  whether president trump has a plan for what comes next must be debated  whether there is a coherence to this missile strike fitting into a larger foreign policy strategy is a question that should give us all pause he goes on to slay the media and puts them in their place  reminding them that it is their job to ask hard questions  rather says there is ample evidence that this administration needs to face deep scrutiny  the lies we have heard  the chaos in governance  and the looming questions about ties with russia   itself a major player in syria   demand that the press treat this latest action with healthy skepticism he concludes his post with a dire warning that we should all pay very close attention to the number of members of the press who have lauded the actions last night as  presidential  is concerning  war must never be considered a public relations operation  it is not a way for an administration to gain a narrative  it is a step into a dangerous unknown and its full impact is impossible to predict  especially in the immediate wake of the first strike what will happen next remains unknown  but one thing is for certain   we can t forget our principles and cave to this monster  no matter how bright and shiny he makes the future sound  he s a liar  a sexual predator  most likely a criminal  and he s most certainly a con artist whose only real public experience was having a reality television show with a famous tagline  that is all he is  don t forget that but  we should always keep hope alive that one day soon we will get to say to him   you re fired   that will be a glorious day you can read dan rather s heartfelt post in its entirety here featured image via getty kirk irwin
