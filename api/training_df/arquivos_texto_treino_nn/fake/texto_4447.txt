unless you count online polls that trump fans voted in multiple times to make it appear as if he won monday s presidential debate  donald trump actually lost  most pundits feel he lost  as did the focus groups used by several of the networks  as did scientific polls that were taken of people who watched the event  he lost  handily trump lost so badly that even his allies who want to see him elected president have been complaining to the media about his limp performance  and that has made trump very very angry in a conference call with surrogates wednesday afternoon  trump aides made clear the republican nominee is upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before his next bout with hillary clinton  and he wants them to stop it immediately the message was  not subtle   a source familiar with the call said trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didn t nail it in the world of trump and his ego  admitting that you lost a battle is the worst thing  possibly even worse than actually losing the battle itself  for someone like trump  who fancies himself an  alpha  male  an admission of humility or defeat is the worst possible scenario  in his eyes  anyone conceding that he underperformed is unacceptable  and even worse if you re in the trump orbit that is why trump almost completely limits himself to media appearances on fox news  where he won t ever seriously be challenged on even the most bizarre and untrue claims he makes in the campaign  trump is inside a bubble  only speaking to those who agree with him and who want to suck up to him  he is being told time and time again by his hangers on that he is doing everything just right  and he won t tolerate anybody who allows reality to intrude featured image via flickr
