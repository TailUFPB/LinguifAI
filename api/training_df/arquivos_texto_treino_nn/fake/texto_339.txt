special counsel robert mueller has just dropped yet another unpleasant bombshell on donald trump  and it s really going to screw our disgraceful potus over in the latest development in trump s russia investigation  mueller is requesting the phone records from an air force one meeting where trump apparently personally dictated the misleading statement about a meeting involving members of his campaign and a russian official politico reports that records that mueller is requesting will give insight into the statement that trump s son  donald trump jr   gave   a statement that caused trump a massive amount of trouble when it was exposed  sources close to the investigation have also stated that mueller is investigating whether or not trump is guilty for obstruction of justice when it comes to the firing of former fbi director james comey to make matters even worse for trump  mueller also wants the documents that were related to a press briefing in may  in which former white house press secretary sean spicer had stated that trump had confidence in comey   and yet he fired the then fbi director less than a week later if this doesn t look like the walls are caving in on trump  we don t know what does  mueller is getting closer to uncovering everything that trump has been hiding  and it doesn t look like it s going to end well for the undeserving potus and his equally crooked campaign  what we can expect in the meantime is some very predictable  erratic behavior from trump   threats to north korea  unpresidential attacks on the media  more obama and clinton jabs   basically anything to distract america from his russia probe  but trump can only do that for so long   and it s clearly starting to catch up with him  it s only a matter of time before mueller catches him red handed featured image via alex wong   getty images
