the apple never falls far from the tree  and trump s kids do everything they can to prove that saying true  donald trump jr  took a page straight out of rape culture in an interview on the  opie and anthony show   where he said that women who can t handle sexual harassment in the workplace  don t belong in the workforce  if you can t handle some of the basic stuff that s become a problem in the workforce today  like  you don t belong in the workforce  like  you should go maybe teach kindergarten  i think it s a respectable position you can t be negotiating billion dollar deals if you can t handle  like  you know  now  why didn t anybody think of that before  it s so stupid it s positively brilliant or maybe the men who are likewise negotiating that deal trump jr  talks about above should  you know  maybe keep their mouths shut and their eyes and minds focused on the negotiations  but hey  trump and his son will say what they want  boys will be boys  right  right  because men can t control themselves and their base instincts so it s always on women to make sure men stay off of us and you just have to love that implication that teaching kindergarten  and by extension  teaching anything at all  isn t a real job in the workforce  so it s okay for women to have those jobs  trump jr  clearly sees women as second class citizens   people to be seen and not heard  and in some cases  probably not seen  either  just like his disgusting father thinks  to make matters worse  the whole interview sounds like they think they re doing nothing more than harmless  locker room talk   with the hosts saying things like  that s the problem with women  they complain and they fuck it up  like i don t like being around just men  i love when women are around  but they complain   oh it s harassment   and that s why we hate them around because they stop us from doing what we want to do  which is  in part  talking about women in a disgusting  derogatory manner  no doubt  they re blaming women for having the audacity to demand to be treated like human beings trump s mini me of a son also implied that the primary reason women complain and sue for harassment is to get rich  wouldn t it be funny if we showed tits and then donald sued   one asked  i d feel harassed   trump jr  joked   this is my get rich quick scheme  i m now suing you guys because i feel uncomfortable   it s not just the gop candidate for president  it s his whole family who thinks this way  anyone who thinks that donald trump would be a good example  a good role model for children need only look at his own children to know that s not true listen to the whole interview segment below featured image by john moore via getty images
