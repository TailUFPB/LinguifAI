the two orlando area hospitals that treated the shooting victims from the tragic pulse nightclub attack are doing something amazing  they won t bill those patients for their out of pocket costs  considering the fact that er visits and hospital stays can run tens of thousands  if not hundreds of thousands of dollars  and our healthcare industry prioritizes getting their due dollars in any way possible over care  this is amazing news indeed instead  orlando regional medical center  which treated most of the victims  will seek additional payment from insurance and from a victims  fund that city officials established in the wake of the shooting  whatever insurance and the victims  fund don t cover will be written off florida hospital  which treated  victims  said it actually won t bill any of them or their insurance  nor will it bill them for follow up treatment stemming from the attack the two hospitals together will write off at least    million in treatment and care david strong  president and ceo of orlando health  said  the pulse  shooting was a horrendous tragedy for the victims  their families and our entire community  during this very trying time  many organizations  individuals and charities have reached out to orlando health to show their support  this is simply our way of paying that kindness forward  the families of those who died won t find themselves charged  either the victims who received care are relieved   they were set to get fucked sideways with a rusty chainsaw by the abysmal payer structure that exists in our healthcare industry  which actually bankrupts entire families  indeed  most of them  if not all of them  can t afford to pay for this level of hospital care these are people who simply went out for a night of fun  and ended up badly hurt and in the hospital  they have to deal with the far more insidious mental and emotional trauma of the shooting in addition to healing from their physical injuries  and victims  families are in a lot of pain  too  nobody should ever have to deal with the added stress of hugantic bills for medical care they need now these victims can relax a bit about their treatment  and focus more of their energy on healing in all ways  if only more in our greedy  for profit healthcare system cared as much as these hospitals featured image by gerardo mora getty images
