 i am not a person who has sought the spotlight  that s the first stand out sentence from the statement jared kushner released monday morning in advance of his testimony before the senate intelligence committee  we re willing to bet that line makes it into his daily mantra as he navigates the nightmare he s realizing he married into  oh  i don t excuse trump s son in law for his part in any of the current investigation fiasco shenanigans  don t get me wrong  but his demeanor clearly indicates a man who is in a different category of prevaricator than the trumps he now unfortunately finds himself wed to in more ways than just his nuptials with ivanka his statement  first reported by cnn  in full here   is an absolute masterwork of distancing himself from the crimes that were obviously committed  with so much of the meeting  between don trump  jr   paul manafort  and himself already out in public   so much already confirmed   there is little to do but work with what he s got  and so carefully  meticulously  kushner has crafted a storyline that excises his participation in the shady dealings with the kremlin lawyer natalia veselnitskaya
