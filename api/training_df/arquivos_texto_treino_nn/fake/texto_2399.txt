on thursday night  actor bradley whitford  of transparent and west wing fame  stopped by the late show to speak with stephen colbert  it just so happens that colbert had adorable adoptable puppies there on the set thursday night as well  and whitford brought one out with him for his interview whitford explained that the puppy  tucker  was calming him down  and that the little animal was helping him deal with donald trump s presidency  whitford said  i need a service dog  since the election  colbert reminded whitford that the actor had already been in full blown  trump panic  back in september  and then proceeded to ask him how he is now  whitford said  this is calming me  but i do want to reiterate that our president was a birther  which is racist and un american  and we have a white nationalist working in the white house  and they have conflated refugees with terrorism  and now they are picking on transgender people  it s not a joke  and it s very upsetting  colbert went on to share some of whitford s large number of political tweets  which are coming these days in a seemingly unending stream  his profile photo also shows him in a pink  pussy hat  from the historic women s march i am so happy that this man articulated what so many of us are feeling these days  i d like one of those puppies to get me through the next four years as well watch the video below featured image via video screen capture
