donald trump has one hell of a week  starting off with his abysmal performance in last monday s debate and ending with saturday s new york times   tax bombshell  trump is currently being lambasted for his manipulation of the tax system and his refusal to release his tax returns harry reid has joined in with rest of the left and has arguably released the most scathing indictment of trump on the matter of his taxes so far  trump is a billion dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled  rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father  reid writes in a press release  despite losing a billion dollars  trump wants to reward himself with more tax breaks on inherited wealth while stiffing middle class families who earn their paychecks with hard work  damn  that s brutal  the u s  democratic senate leader did not stop there  reid continues  demanding that trump release his tax returns and spells out very clearly what it means if the republican presidential nominee continues to refuse to do so  trump is over leveraged and deeply indebted to someone  but until he releases his taxes we won t know who  the implications for america s security are severe  the american people deserve to know who has leverage over this man who wants to be president  in the name of the public interest  the senate should immediately pass the presidential tax transparency act  which would force all presidential candidates to release their tax returns  if all senators agreed to pass this act for the good of the country  we could pass it in a matter of minutes  if the presidential tax transparency act were passed  trump would be forced to release his tax returns  let s step back and take stock  senate republicans have put party so far ahead of country  they ve endorsed a racist  incompetent failure who managed to lose a billion dollars in a boom year   reid writes   now they are helping trump hide his tax returns and preventing the american people from knowing what individuals  businesses or foreign interests could have leverage over trump  it s time we rip open trump s closet and let the world see the financial skeletons he is hiding  the american people have trusted their officials to release their tax returns voluntarily  trump is the first person in decades not to release his returns  he has proven that he cannot be trusted  trump and all other future candidates  tax returns releases should be mandatory  not only will it will be a small step forward towards a brighter more transparent democracy  it ll also make the financially corrupt think twice before running for office featured image from chip somodevilla getty images
