there s a man who s been permanently banned from twitter for threats and harassment  and was once known as the  most hated man on the internet   who s working behind the scenes to advise  and even approve of  some of trump s nominees  that man is charles  chuck  johnson  not to be confused with little green footballs  charles johnson   and he s used his platform to spread racist hate and outright lies and forbes reports that he s working to help pick trump s administration one of the least reputable  most hateful  vengeful trolls on the entire planet is helping trump s transition team with various nominees  and not just any nominees   the worst nominees  the far right  white nationalist  anti semitic  misogynistic nominees  the ones known to be  alt right   which is the most laughable term for that crowd ever johnson fancies himself a  debunker of frauds   but he s no stranger to lies and severely unethical behavior himself  he s the man who claimed that the sony hack  which happened at the hands of north korea  was actually an inside job  this is the man who tweeted that he needed help in taking out deray mckesson  which is what got him permanently banned  he claims he was just asking for info for reporting purposes  but the wording is highly suspicious  he has a history of relentlessly attacking  and even doxing   elitist  journalists  left wing activists   lying women and thuggish black men   and anyone he thinks has screwed him over in some way  you know  typical troll stuff that puts people in real life danger johnson also worked for steve bannon at breitbart  and bannon is a known white nationalist  bannon is the one that turned breitbart from a heavily right wing news site into a conspiracy site that pushes the white nationalist agenda  so  in a way  it makes sense that johnson would be advising trump s transition team it was johnson himself who first said that he was involved with vetting nominees  which sounds pretty far fetched on the surface and could have been a way for him to puff himself up  given his history of self promotion  that wouldn t have been surprising however  multiple sources close to trump s team confirmed to forbes that johnson actually is working behind the scenes with the transition team  and possibly with people as high in the chain as peter thiel  who was one of trump s biggest campaign donors  johnson denies this  it is sick and disgusting that someone who s made a name for himself by spreading lies and doxing people is working on a presidential transition like this  it s also par for the course  which just makes us want to barf featured image via screen capture
