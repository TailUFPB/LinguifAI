so here s a funny hypothetical  you re a white house communications director  you ve settled into your office in the west wing  you have a definite connection with the boss   your speaking styles are similar  you come from the same moneyed and even geographical background  and just for good measure  let s say you both are known to engage in the occasional  locker room talk   honestly  you re over the moon at landing this job  because you ve been after it for half a year  and god knows there have been some twerps standing in your way there s really only one thing you should be concerned with  and that s knowing how to do this  maybe anthony scaramucci got so excited to work for donald trump that he forgot to learn that last part  and if this hypothetical were about you  dear reader  i can t imagine that you d overlook a teensy detail like knowing how to do things  off the record  the mooch s downfall came from the hilariously bad telephone conversation he had with ryan lizza  washington correspondent for the new yorker  scaramucci called lizza to try and ascertain the identity of a  leaker  who had told him about a dinner donald trump attended  that phone call was  as everyone now knows  recorded now mooch is claiming that ryan lizza broke the law  or rather  he s insinuating it   ryanlizza is the linda tripp of   people know  and he is up at night not being able to live with himself   anthony scaramucci   scaramucci  august    tripp  of course  is the woman who recorded over  hours of telephone conversations with monica lewinski  whose dalliances with bill clinton ended with impeachment in the house of representatives  there are questions to this day whether or not tripp broke the law  maryland law still dictates that all parties must consent to the taping of a phone call  but courts there ruled at the time that the law didn t apply to people who didn t know it was illegal  she broke the law  but if she didn t know she was breaking the law  she didn t break it  ooookay so of course that led to the question are you accusing him of taping the call without your permission   roland scahill   rolandscahill  august    the succinct  albeit editorialized  answer yes  he absolutely taped the call without my permission   lowlife https   t co   anthony scaramucci   scaramucci  august     like his former boss  thinks that any offense committed against him must somehow be a crime  we learned from the phone call to lizza that mooch believed  leaking  his  publicly available  financial disclosures to the press wasn t just a crime but a felony for which he promised to involve the fbi and doj  so does he think lizza  hashtag lowlife   by recording without his  permission   broke the law as well turns out it doesn t matter  in washington d c    where both ends of the phone call took place   taping a telephone conversation requires only the consent of one party  don t wonder too long about whether hitting a button to start recording is consent from one  it is  and from his tweets today  ryan lizza is definitely not losing sleep over it sorry  mooch  you re still the dipshit who just didn t know how to do his job  and really  talking to the press is pretty much one of the only jobs a wh director of communications even has to do  right featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
