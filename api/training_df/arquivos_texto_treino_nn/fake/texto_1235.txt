if donald trump and his team are trying to pretend that everything is fine and nothing s wrong  they re not doing a very good job earlier today  trump kicked off the morning by indulging in his habitual twitter habit whenever he s nervous about something  providing a distraction from former fbi director james comey s testimony  trump decided to announce his pick for a new fbi director   signaling that trump is nervous as hell and desperate to take the heat off the russia scandal  it turns out  his vice president is also freaking out apparently  mike pence reacted to the release of comey s opening statement by abruptly cancelling a scheduled interview   literally right before it was supposed to happen  now  pence is cowering and has gone into hiding  here s what went down  according to pbs pence bailed with no warning whatsoever comey s released opening statement has clearly taken the white house by surprise  and everyone s in panic mode now  the white house has been on media lockdown since the release of the statement  and pence s response surely raised suspicions pence  without a doubt  cancelled that interview so he wouldn t have to answer questions about comey   because he could not only further incriminate trump  but himself as well  despite the fact that most of the focus has been on trump  pence is also in big trouble because of the russia scandal  trump s entire administration is in danger if he goes down what happens tomorrow during comey s testimony will likely change the entire direction of the russia scandal  and it already looks as if it is going to mean bad news for trump  all of the warning signs and red flags are present  and everyone close to trump is now running for the hills  for pence to cancel this interview certainly means something fishy is happening  and most of us can t wait to find out featured image via alex wong   getty images
