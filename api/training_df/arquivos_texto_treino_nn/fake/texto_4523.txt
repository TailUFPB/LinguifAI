fox news host sean hannity desperately tried to smear terence crutcher on wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local tulsa news anchor crutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer betty shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers  the murder was caught on camera clearly  the unarmed crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers  especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them but sean hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest  i understand that in this particular case mr crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging   hannity said  which prompted tulsa news anchor russell mills to smack hannity down with facts  well i ll tell you i looked up his history and i m not seeing a lot of criminal history   mills replied   we have something called the oscn   the oklahoma supreme court network  i was able to find a protective order from  years ago that was dismissed  i found a couple of financial things  there s no violent criminal history for mr  crutcher that i ve been able to uncover  but hannity didn t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest mills informed hannity that there were no such warrants hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants  i have not seen any reporting on any warrants for mr  crutcher and i certainly haven t uncovered any myself   mills said   there has been some misinformation floated  a disappointed hannity resorted to claiming that he has a  source  within the department and said that  it s a matter of time of when they re gonna release this information  here s the audio via media matters once again  sean hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified  the bottom line  however  is that crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers  he wasn t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway  officer betty shelby should be arrested and charged with murder  period featured image  screenshot
