one of the major things with donald trump s speech at the nato summit that shocked everyone was his refusal to commit to article   which basically states that an attack on one member is an attack on all  but his speech wasn t supposed to be that way   words were removed from that speech  and that threw his national security team for a loop  they had no idea those words had been deleted trump was supposed to say  we face many threats  but i stand here before you with a clear message  the u s  commitment to the nato alliance and to article  is unwavering  but he didn t  and his national security team  and really  the rest of his administration  was left to clean up the shitstorm that resulted from that removal  everyone  from mike pence to national security adviser h r  mcmaster to defense secretary jim mattis  has been on  cleanup duty   going out of their way to try and convince the world that we do  in fact  remain committed to article  but apparently  the white house doesn t think it matters  here s a hint to them  it does   spicer told reporters that he thought the whole mess was  a silly discussion   and that trump s presence at the summit should have been enough to show our allies that we remain committed to all  articles of the nato alliance spicer made it sound like trump deigned to attend an event which was beneath him and thus  not worthy of his time because of his ridiculous behavior and terrible understanding of everything  foreign policy advisers are now frantically trying to convince our allies that they still matter to us  and that trump is still their partner trump put our allies badly on edge when he refused to commit to article   and with other things he said at both the nato summit and the  summit  in doing so  he s forced germany and france to try and isolate us in order to maintain the strength of their own alliances  because trump just proved that we are no longer a steadfast and true partner  he may as well have come out and said   don t trust us anymore  don t rely on us anymore  featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
