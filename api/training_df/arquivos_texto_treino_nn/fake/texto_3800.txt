as much as we activists might wish otherwise  it s not always a good idea to talk politics  this is particularly true if you re a insecure idiot trumpkin who just has to say something stupid and racist to the passenger next to you on a plane  this actually happened on a united airlines flight from san francisco to puerto vallarta  mexico  where a trump supporter scared the passenger next to him by gloating about the cheeto king s win according to the caption on the youtube video  this trump fan was wearing a plaid shirt and a camo cap  and he just had to say something about being happy that he could keep his guns to the black woman next to him  she began to cry likely because that sounds an awful lot like a threat  and the racism and racist threats that have been oozing out of trumpkins since nov   is just vile the two were separated  and then the pilot gave the entire plane a very stern talking to  thanks to said trump fan  we re going to be in a metal tube at   feet to bring up politics  okay  i understand everybody has their opinions  that s fine nobody wants to argue  nobody s going to change their minds by arguing  and let s keep our opinions to ourselves on this particular matter at this particular time if there s anybody that has a problem with this  that needs to vent or rant or rave  there s another flight tomorrow  you re not going to be on this one  i hope that s clear  he got a lot of cheers for that while some might interpret his full remarks as insensitive and even pro trump  he actually did what he needed to do to defuse the situation  furthermore  he took down the gloating trumpkin in the process  much to the pleasure of the other passengers  listen to his entire rebuke below featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
