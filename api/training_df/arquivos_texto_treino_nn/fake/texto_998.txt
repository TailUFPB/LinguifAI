donald trump was in a room full of irish reporters while placing a call to their newly elected irish leader leo varadkar when irish reporter caitriona perry seems to have caught his eye  what followed was awkward for everybody in the room  especially the deeply confused reporter despite being married to his third wife and at that very moment awaiting a phone call with world leader  trump decided it would be a good time to flirt with perry  first  picking her out of the sea of reporters  he tells her to come closer  then he asks what outlet she works for  and while she answers  he talks over her saying  we have beautiful irish press   when the moment descends into awkward silence  trump tells her she has a  nice smile  perry laughs uncomfortably  the rest of us cringe on twitter  perry herself posted the video  describing it as a  bizarre moment  video of the bizarre moment when president  realdonaldtrump called me over during his call with taoiseach  campaignforleo varadkar   rtenews pic twitter com   caitriona perry   caitrionaperry  june     for americans  the moment is painfully real  trump  by his own admission  boasted that he likes exploiting his celebrity status to come on to women   even if they say no  shortly before the election  over a dozen women came forward to describe times he inappropriately touched or harassed them trump has also been known to target reporters with sexual advances  during the election  people magazine reporter natasha stoynoff documented the time she says trump assaulted her while his wife was in the house since the election  many of the people who voted for him despite the allegations justified doing so by saying his alleged victims were making it all up  but his continued behavior is troubling  to watch trump come on to perry so brazenly only seems to reinforce the idea that he has crossed the line with other women  the cameras were rolling  there was a room full of people  and this is how he behaves featured image via twitter
