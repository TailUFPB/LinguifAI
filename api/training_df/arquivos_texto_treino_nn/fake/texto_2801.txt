donald trump s latest executive orders are being protested against and shredded for their xenophobic  hateful nature   and the republicans who didn t have the backbone to stand up to him are getting equally pummeled among the biggest moronic minion who didn t have the balls to stand up to tyrant trump is house speaker paul ryan  who got absolutely decimated on wikipedia recently  in reference to his complete lack of spine  a wikipedia page listed him under invertebrates  joining the ranks of creatures like worms  truly  there has never been a better way to describe ryan and similar gopers   until now this edit to the invertebrate wikipedia page was first spotted by buzzfeed s alp ozcelik  and it is so perfect according to the wikipedia page  invertebrates are characterized like this  the trait that is common to all invertebrates is the absence of a vertebral column  backbone   this creates a distinction between invertebrates and vertebrates  the distinction is one of convenience only  it is not based on any clear biologically homologous trait  any more than the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects  bats  and birds  or than not having wings unites tortoises  snails and sponges  being animals  invertebrates are heterotrophs  and require sustenance in the form of the consumption of other organisms  with a few exceptions  such as the porifera  invertebrates generally have bodies composed of differentiated tissues  there is also typically a digestive chamber with one or two openings to the exterior  we couldn t have said it better ourselves  ryan s behavior when it comes to trump has been extremely disappointing  and he has become more of a pushover since trump officially became potus  proving that he doesn t have the guts or spine to stand by his previous statements  ryan quietly allowed trump to go ahead with his muslim ban this week  despite the fact that he felt very differently in july to compare  this is what ryan said after trump signed his disastrous executive order this week  our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland  we are a compassionate nation  and i support the refugee resettlement program  but it s time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process  this is why we passed bipartisan legislation in the wake of the paris attacks to pause the intake of refugees  president trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country  it is absolutely disgusting to have people like this in power  fortunately  the internet came to our rescue to provide some much needed humor during a time when doom seems eminent  at least someone still dares to tell the truth   even if they re just anonymously editing a wikipedia page  we truly hope they will do it again featured image via alex wong   getty images
