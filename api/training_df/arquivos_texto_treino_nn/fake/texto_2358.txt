there s been a spate of attacks on jews around the u s  recently  including destroying jewish cemeteries and issuing bomb threats to jewish community centers and synagogues  trump did condemn rising anti semitism  but when asked about this growing threat earlier today  he suggested that something else could be happening  and it s just flat out sick in a meeting with several states  attorneys general  he said  sometimes it s the reverse  to make people or to make others look bad  while he hasn t clarified what he actually means by this  it sounds pretty clear  he thinks either that the jewish community itself is doing this  why  we don t know   or liberals are behind this to frame his white nationalist  neo nazi  kkk and anti semitic followers  he said it was  reprehensible   according to pennsylvania s attorney general  but it s clear he d rather believe in some kind of conspiracy than the fact that his supporters include people who want to eradicate everyone who isn t straight  cis  white and christian breaking  pa attorney general  trump told us  sometimes it s the reverse   when asked about anti semitic threats and attacks  pic twitter com   chris geidner   chrisgeidner  february    says trump used the word  reverse  two or three times in his remarks  that really does imply that he thinks jews might be doing this to themselves  for what  sympathy  come on  because what s the reverse of being an attack victim  being the attacker  how vile and sick do you have to be to suggest that the white house  however  claims he didn t suggest that at all  they did say that he thinks protesters probably his phantom professional liberal protesters are behind it  however  it s kind of odd that this sort of mirrors what former kkk grand wizard david duke has also said about the attacks trump echoes david duke  suggests jews are behind threats to jewish schools https   t co zcpmjsmwpj pic twitter com   judd legum   juddlegum  february    is a sick piece of worm infested shit  we can t end any of this with a president who refuses to acknowledge the problem because it means acknowledging that his core base is likewise a bunch of sick  worm infested pieces of shit  it s only going to get worse featured image by aude guerrucci via getty images
