trump s threatening of the press seems to be paying dividends already  with at least one publication removing a quote that could be seen as  embarrassing   for trump   the washington post on tuesday  buzzfeed reported that a quote was removed from washington post columnist richard cohen column published that morning   and it s a prett important one  the publication reports trump was reportedly referring to his daughter  ivanka  who was  years old at the time the quote was circulated monday in a draft of cohen s piece  our next president  the godfather  that was sent to outlets that syndicate the column  a source told buzzfeed news  the quote did not appear in the later  final version of the piece carried by the post and other outlets cohen s column details the president elect s increasingly blurred familial and political ties as he prepares to enter the white house the reporting appeared in an advance version of the column that was circulated on monday for publication on tuesday and thereafter  it appeared as an aside after the introduction of jared kushner  which still appears in the final column jared kushner  our tom hagen  who married trump s stunning daughter ivanka    can i ask you something   trump asked someone i know  about his then  year old kid   is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife     has lately lost some of this boy scout aura  it turns out kushner s admission to harvard was preceded by his father s    million pledge however  the words between the hyphens   you know  the ones that reveal what a scumbag our next president is   were quietly removed from the final version  the washington post offered buzzfeed a suspiciously dodgy excuse for the removal  hint  it wasn t that the quote was fake   we  or the washington post writers group  our affiliated syndicate  edit every column to try to make it as good as it can be  editorial page editor fred hiatt said  we don t think it would be fair to our writers to discuss the editing process  and don t see what is to be gained by talking about things that are not published there are countless drafts that never see the light of day   hiatt added  still not explaining why it was removed on monday  trump gathered major media heads together in one room so he could scream at them and call them liars   lugenpresse  to use his supporters  term  the removal of this damning quote seems to be a reaction to the president elect s bullying of the press and yet another example of the media failing to hold the donald accountable for anything he does or says it might seem unbelievable that trump would say such a thing about his daughter  but we re dealing with a man who has been talking about having sex with her since around the time he met paris hilton and thought she was hot  hilton was  at the time  recently  after trump appeared on  dr  oz   the show cut out a remark about kissing ivanka  as often as possible  he has also been photographed in numerous suggestive poses with his daughter  including a prizewinning one of the two of them in bed together   when she was around  years old  he also has made it very clear that the two of them have  sex  in common  there is video of that   was caught on tape hitting on a  year old  and  of course  who can forget that time he groped ivanka on national television  at least she was an adult in this case   then  of course  there is the fact that he is accused of raping a  year old girl  his accuser abruptly dropped the lawsuit after trump s supporters threatened her  we may never know why the washington post removed this latest horrific quote about trump s daughter  but one thing is for certain  it was just a grain of sand on a beach of horribleness featured image via if you only news getty images  archive
