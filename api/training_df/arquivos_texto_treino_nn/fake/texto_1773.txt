saturday night live is back with new episodes  and this week s cold open did not disappoint  as the iconic show went live coast to coast for the first time in history  they went all in on the incompetence of the donald s reality show  presidency    alec baldwin returned as the reliably buffoonish trump  and jimmy fallon played the notoriously silent son in law and top adviser  jared kusher  to round off the spoof  the grim reaper returned as the newly diminished steve bannon  there was even a cameo by  mike pence   played by beck bennett  where the show ruthlessly mocked reports that pence actually calls his wife  mother  in the spoof  baldwin s trump is doing a reality show style elimination round to finally end the kushner vs  bannon feud that has been irritating him and amusing the rest of us for weeks now  he starts out by saying that he is holding a photo of each adviser  and only one will get to stay   trump  praises  kushner  for being photogenic  while telling  bannon  that pictures of him make him want to puke  in the end  kushner is chosen  and another grim reaper like figure comes to take  bannon  to hell  after that  snl kicked off what is sure to be a successful  president kushner  narrative  as they have  trump  tell  kushner  to sit at the president s desk in the oval office  while  trump  himself returns to the child s desk to play with his toys  just as he did in previous episodes with  president bannon  all in all  snl outdid themselves with this one  there are no words to describe how funny this is watch below for the most hilarious few minutes of your evening featured image via video screen capture
