barack and michelle obama are incredibly smart  articulate and charming  they came from relatively modest backgrounds and the obama administration was nearly completely scandal free  so why wouldn t republicans vote for the man whose only real promise was to be the anti obama well  they got the anti obama  donald trump is rude  crude and without class or charm  his iq  or at least his communication skills  are below that of your average  grader and in fewer than four months  he has racked up more scandals than any president in history  on the governing front  we ll he s been the anti obama there too  he s trying to overturn every single obama accomplishment  including michelle s efforts at ensuring that poor children receive at least some nutrition at school  which for republicans  is a step too far now  the trump administration is putting a stop to those evil healthy lunches  agriculture secretary sunny perdue is delaying requirements for schools to have reduced sodium in lunches and he is issuing waivers so schools won t have to serve whole grains  yes  depriving children of healthy lunches is petty and petulant  but that s the way the trump administration rolls  so michelle obama weighed in speaking at an annual health conference in washington  d c   obama said more nutritious school lunches are important since millions of kids eat federally subsidized school breakfast and lunch  without mentioning president donald trump  she said parents should stop and  think about why someone is ok with your kids eating crap  if we want to make this country great  our kids need to be healthy   obama said   not some  but all  source  nbc chicagomichelle also took aim at the gop argument that she was helping to create a nanny state by attempting to regulate school lunches  in the perfectly crafted response  she pointed instead at the oligarchy  which lets corporations make the decisions for us  you want to talk about nanny state and government intervention  well   you just buy the food and be quiet and you don t need to know what is in it    obama said   that is essentially what a move like this is saying to you moms  she even used trump s own words against him  saying that if we want to make america great  we need healthy children  it does seem pretty simple  doesn t it featured image via gerardo mora getty images
