most people think of house speaker paul ryan as completely safe in his seat  after all  he is seen as the gop s golden boy  though those of us with our eyes open see him as a sociopath in a suit   well  it seems that ryan might not be so safe after all  democrats have made large inroads into deep red districts in the recent special elections  we may not have won outright  but we really didn t expect to  but we made huge gains  slashing wins in districts carried by   points by republicans down to single digits  this is why it is so encouraging that randy bryce  a veteran and iron worker in paul ryan s wisconsin district is running to take the speaker s seat bryce released a powerful campaign ad that shows him to be a working class citizen who is connected to his community  also featured in the ad is bryce s mother  who has multiple sclerosis  she talks about all the drugs she is on  and how she doesn t know what will happen if she cannot take her medication  this woman is representative of so many sick people around the nation  and it is sure to resonate with many people  it also features a clip of paul ryan s infamous   everybody doesn t get what they want   line when he was talking about repealing the affordable care act paul ryan is a callous  heartless bastard  and randy bryce may very well be able to expose that fact  hopefully  bryce s powerful message will force paul ryan into early retirement watch this amazing ad below featured image via win mcnamee getty images
