donald trump s efforts to reach out to voters of color has been going about as terrible as one might expect it to go  kayleigh mcenany  an avid trump supporter  took part in a panel discussion on cnn s anderson cooper    where she attempted to continue that campaign  not surprisingly  all she did was got shut down by the black members of the panel  bakari sellers and angela rae mcenary began the panel discussion which revolved around black issues  by shouting down the black panelists  citing statistics about black people and poverty  saying that  you might think a    poverty rate among african american individuals is a good thing but  at that point  mcenary is interrupted by rae who insists that no one had made that claim  asking her to retract the statement that s when the panel really began to go into melt down  mcenery tried to position trump as a civil rights leader who  was on the cutting edge of civil rights  because he fought for inclusiveness in his clubs  while trump might have expanded his customer base to include black and jewish americans  the other panelists were not buying it for a moment that trump was a civil rights leader what mcenery failed to mention  but rae didn t  is that trump only began to allow black and jewish americans into his clubs after he had been sued for housing discrimination the best moment of the panel discussion is when rae lays her thoughts out on the matter  she does not hold back  saying  if you want donald trump to say something that s meaningful to black people  and i m not going to be the spokesperson for all black people tonight  but what i m going to tell you is this  plain and simple  he can disavow his racist butler  he can apologize for those two housing discriminations from the department of justice  he can tell me that that black lives matter protester who he said deserves to get beat up  he can retract that and apologize for that  he can tell me that he never meant to say those legal fees of that guy that punched that black man in the face at his rally  should ve happened  he can apologize for the indian man that was thrown out of his rally today  he can apologize to the central park five  sellers interrupts to say  all five of them  for taking out that full page ad on them   i m not done  i m just getting started and i haven t even got to last july   rae continues   my only point to you is this  donald trump doesn t just have a messaging problem  he has a message and belief problem  kayleigh  and he has to   he has to hear it from more than rhinestones and polyester  his two little imps that go out on the trail for him  you can watch the panel discussion in full featured image from video screenshot
