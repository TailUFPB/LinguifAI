according to gop congressman sean duffy  we need to stop talking about terrorist acts committed by white people in the united states and hop on board the trump train  during an interview tuesday morning with cbb s alisyn camerota  duffy completely lost it when asked why the trump administration seems determined to ignore any and all terrorist acts committed by white people as they focus on banning entry from seven countries that have not produced a deadly terrorist attack within our borders since    you don t have a group like isis or al qaeda that s inspiring people around the world to kill innocents   duffy said when confronted with white terrorist attacks like the recent mosque massacre in canada   that was a one off   pretending that the attack in canada is the only recent example of a white extremist slaughtering innocents  duffy continued harping about isis  how about the charleston church shooting  congressman   camerota asked   he was a white extremist  that doesn t matter   at this point  things got crazy  duffy explained that the charleston massacre matters  but only because because  good things  came from it  it does matter  it does matter  look at the good things that came from it  nikki haley took down the confederate flag  that was great  naturally  he didn t mention the numerous african americans who were killed  or that the white supremacist who murdered all those people followed the same ideology as he does  this sort of statement is crazy and insulting to the victims and their families and the congressman s response makes him look awful  but he only managed to get crazier when he claimed that former congresswoman gabby giffords  who is quite alive  is dead  look at gabby giffords  the marxist who took her life  a leftist guy  and now you see violence and terror in the streets all across america  watch the interview below but what about white terrorism  the cnn reporter asks this congressman    his response is exactly the problem  https   t co   deray mckesson   deray  february    more featured image via screengrab
