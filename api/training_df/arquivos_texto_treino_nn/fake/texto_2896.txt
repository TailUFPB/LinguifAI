the internet has been destroying the trump administration s press secretary  former republican national committee mouthpiece sean spicer  as everyone now knows  spicer spent his very first press briefing lying about trump s inaugural crowd size as compared to those of president barack obama  of course  we all know that president obama s  crowd size reached historic numbers  exceeding one million people  when comparison photos were tweeted out  this was clearly just too much for trump s fragile ego  so he sent spicer out to rag on the press for reporting  well  facts about trump s pathetic crowds well  since this administration clearly has no issue with lying straight to the faces of the american people  brian fallon  the former press secretary for hillary for america  went on cnn to weigh in on what he would have done had he ever been put in the position of lying to the american public regarding this or anything else  fallon said  there s clear intent  it was a lie  it should be called a lie  and if he was put in the situation by  reince priebus or his boss  donald trump  to go out and tell a lie to the american people  he should have resigned rather than go out and take the podium  spicer  of course  lied through his teeth  and said  as he blasted the press  this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration  period  both in person and around the globe  this is simply untrue  and there are photos and numbers to prove it  but the ease of fact checking such a thing matters not to the trump white house  in fact  while speaking to nbc s chuck todd on sunday  kellyanne conway called spicer s lies  alternative facts   as if refusing to call them what they are lies makes everything just a okay fallon continued  saying that he s never been asked to do any such thing  but he hoped he wouldn t do what spicer did after being asked by cnn s brian stelter what he d have done if he were asked to lie like that  but i d like to think that if i ever was  i would have too much integrity to go out and look in the cameras and say something that was provably false  then again  brian fallon would never be in such a position  because a  hillary would never ask her staff to do such a thing because she s not a petulant brat like trump is  and b  she wouldn t need to  because her inaugural crowds would have reached record highs as well too bad we ll never know what could have been  and we re stuck with this orange moron for at least four years watch the exchange below featured image via alex wong getty images
