trumpcare failed in the most hilarious and dramatic middle of the night vote on the senate floor   they couldn t even pass a  skinny repeal  after seven years of promising to repeal the affordable care act  and  of course  the toddler in chief  getting ever more desperate to actually start  winning   threw a livid fit on twitter about it and some republicans look like they re starting to let his twitter tantrums dictate their behavior  they can t even understand the words  give up   it seems  despite the fact that mcconnell and others in the gop leadership have said it s time to move on to other things  lindsey graham already has a new proposal that would give block grants to states for things like medicaid  and keep most of the existing tax structure from the aca trump s white house also went crawling to rep  mark meadows over in the house to see how they could get more conservatives on board with  well  pretty much anything  all of this happened not too long after trump went after republicans for being the utter failures they are  he wants them to switch to a  vote threshold so  democrats can t control the country  in his words   and he threatened to end payments to insurance companies and yank congress  healthcare plans  which they get through the aca s exchanges  if a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly  bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    has even repeatedly asked mcconnell to change senate rules to make it so that they only need  votes to pass anything  the thing that trump isn t getting is that every trumpcare bill that s failed in the senate thus far has done so because it failed to even reach  votes  plus mcconnell won t change the rules anyway maybe if republicans would actually work with democrats  who have said they re open and willing to work on a bipartisan plan to fix problems in the aca  we wouldn t be having this problem featured image via drew angerer getty images
