sarah palin has stepped out of the shadows and sent a warning shot across donald trump s bow  largely silent for most of the election since she endorsed trump some months ago  palin is speaking out after trump made comments that have been interpreted as a change in his anti immigration position while there s no actual concrete policy shift  and just comments made on cable news  trump has said he could back away from his proposed plan for a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants that has angered palin  who went on the record with the wall street journal in recent days  mr  trump has shifted away from calling for mass deportation of illegal immigrants to suggesting some could stay if they paid back taxes  if mr  trump were to go down a path of wishy washy positions taken on things that the core foundation of his support has so appreciated  and that is respecting our constitution and respecting law and order in america  then yeah  there would be massive disappointment   mrs  palin  the republican nominee for vice president in   said in a telephone interview with the wall street journal   parts of that message we heard in the last week are clearly not consistent with the stringent position and message that supporters have received all along  support from palin undoubtedly helped trump during the primaries  especially when she had previously been associated with more traditional conservatives like senator ted cruz but since then she has been on the backburner  he has done few campaign events with her  and she did not receive a speaking slot at the republican convention in cleveland  when asked about the apparent snub  trump made the bizarre claim   it s a little bit difficult because of where she is  we love sarah  little bit difficult because of  you know  it s a long ways away   palin has previously spoken at conservative events like cpac on the east coast without any transportation problems featured image via youtube
