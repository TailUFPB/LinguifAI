donald trump is a misogynist  we all know that  he has demonstrated it many times  and anyone with access to cable or the internet has seen the numerous advertisements from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton s campaign using trump s own words as we see images of young girls and women with body image issues  that s to say nothing of the week long weight shaming episode he engaged in with the winner of miss universe   alicia machado  who revealed that trump publicly humiliated her during her reign for putting on a few pounds  and even referred to her as  miss piggy  as horrific as all of those examples are  though  that s nothing compared to what has just been released  it is a  conversation between trump and billy bush  who worked for access hollywood at the time  trump and bush were on a bus  and they were discussing women s bodies  trump had only been married to melania for eight months at the time  but he was going on and on about some married woman he had been attempting to sleep with  on the audio  trump s clearly recognizable voice can be heard saying  i moved on her actually  she was down in palm beach and i failed  i ll admit it  i did try to fuck her  she was married   and i moved on her very heavily  i took her out furniture shopping  she wanted to get some furniture and i told her  i ll show you where you can get some nice furniture   trump is heard saying   i moved on her like a bitch  and i could not get there  and she was married  and all the sudden i see her and she s got the big phony tits  she s totally changed her look   he says of women he finds attractive in general  i m automatically attracted to beautiful women   i just start kissing them  it s like a magnet  i don t even wait  and when you re a star  they let you do it  you can do anything  grab  em by the pussy  trump then goes on to talk about a pretty woman who was to greet them at the bus  woah  woah  i gotta use some tic tacs just in case i start kissing her  of course  the trump campaign is brushing it aside  trump himself says in a statement  this was locker room banter  a private conversation that took place many years ago  bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course   not even close  i apologize if anyone was offended  no  this is most certainly not just  locker room banter  at this point  this is just another chapter in a lifetime of misogyny  of objectifying  bullying  and mistreating women  if this doesn t show that donald trump is a clear sexist who engages in regular bouts of disgusting lewdness and belongs nowhere near the white house  i don t know what will listen to his disgusting words below  warning  explicit language  featured image via drew angerer getty images
