george stephanopoulos refused to take shit from mike pence on sunday the abc host of this week grilled pence for repeatedly defending donald trump s false claim that  million people voted illegally to help hillary clinton win the popular vote  in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally   trump wrote last month in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    claim has been repeatedly debunked ever since and people in both parties have criticized trump for it politifact gave the claim a  pants on fire  rating because trump got the information from right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones who got it from some guy who refused to provide evidence to support his claim when stephanopoulos interviewed pence  he demanded to know if he thinks it s responsible for trump to make false claims  that claim is groundless   stephanopoulos said   there s no evidence to back it up  is it responsible for a president elect to make false statements like that  pence pathetically defended trump by bringing up a  pew center study that even the study s own author says does not prove widespread voter fraud  especially the kind of voter fraud trump is claiming once again  stephanopoulos informed pence that trump s statement  is false  pence continued to pretend that trump has evidence to back up his claim and suggested that he has the right to make claim claims  i think the president elect just wants to call to attention the fact that there has been evidence over many years   pence said   it s certainly his right  it s his right to make false statements   a bewildered stephanopoulos asked pence responded by dodging the question and called trump  refreshing  while praising his ability to brainwash people into hanging on his every word  i think one of the things that s refreshing about our president elect  i think he made such an incredible connection with people all across this country because he tells you what s on his mind  stephanopoulos refused to let pence get away with not answering his question   but why is it refreshing to make false statements   he asked and then the interview got testy as pence claimed that nobody knows if trump s statement is false or not  leading stephanopoulos to hit pence hard to conclude the interview pence   i don t know that is a false statement and neither do you  there is historic evidence from the pew research center that voter fraud has taken place  stephanopoulos   can you provide any evidence to back up that statement  pence   he s entitled to express his opinion on that  i think the american people find it very refreshing that they have a president who will tell them what s on his mind  stephanopoulos   whether it s true or not  here s the video via youtube this is already shaping up to be a most corrupt dishonest adminstration in american history and mike pence doesn t even have the balls to call out trump on his bullshit featured image  screenshot
