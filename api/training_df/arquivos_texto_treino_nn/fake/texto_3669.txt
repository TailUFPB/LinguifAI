to say that president elect donald trump is bent out of shape over the recount initiated by green party candidate jill stein is a serious understatement  not only did trump recently call stein s filing for a recount in wisconsin a  scam   but he had a meltdown of epic proportions on twitter last night  which carried over into this morning in a massive tweetstorm  trump attacked his former rival for the white house  hillary clinton  and the democratic party  he tweeted  the democrats  when they incorrectly thought they were going to win  asked that the election night tabulation be accepted  not so anymore  hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in  nothing will change  trump s obviously nervous  because there were already discrepancies in votes found in several precincts in wisconsin   and they only showed on trump s ballots  there s a problem when there are more votes than actual people who voted trump continued and tried to portray clinton as a hypocrite for getting behind stein s recount  using her own words against her  quoting clinton s response to trump s own accusations that the election was  rigged  against him and his refusal to concede if he lost  trump wrote  that is horrifying  that is not the way our democracy works  been around for  years  we ve had free and fair elections  we ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them  and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a   during a general election  i  for one  am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position  trump also pointed out that clinton called trump s refusal to accept the election s results  a direct threat to our democracy   it should be noted that clinton gracefully accepted the results  and promised to regardless of the outcome   unlike trump  in a last attempt to make clinton look bad  trump used a quote from her concession speech  he tweeted  we have to accept the results and look to the future  donald trump is going to be our president  we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead  and completely oblivious to the fact that the republican party has wasted more than enough money on the ridiculous scavenger hunt into clinton s emails  trump said  so much time and money will be spent   same result  sad  here s the full tweetstorm twittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwittertwitterfeatured image via andrew renneisen   getty images
