in a perfect democracy  there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from  each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote  and each one would have an equal chance at winning  unfortunately  because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the united states  we re pretty much stuck with a two party system and any third party vote goes to help one of the two major parties think ralph nader in  and how his votes in florida gave us george w  bush  well  nader and the supreme court it s imperfect  but until laws are changed  it is what it is  no amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that  what we need are legislators willing to change the laws  but that s never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits this year s election is so critical not just for the nation  but the entire world  a donald trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels  both with domestic and foreign policy reminding everyone how important this election is  and how a third party vote will give us a president trump  is none other than the legendary writer producer and creator of family guy  seth macfarlane macfarlane tweeted  remember  this november you can help elect president donald trump just by voting for gary johnson or jill stein  happy election year  remember  this november you can help elect president donald trump just by voting for gary johnson or jill stein  happy election year   seth macfarlane   sethmacfarlane  september    sarcasm is more a terrifying wake up call than just witty banter on the twitter machine does this mean you shouldn t vote for stein or johnson  no  of course not  however  it needs to be brought to people s attention that their vote for a third party isn t actually going to put their candidate into office  but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with trump a  conscience vote  does not do anyone any good with a fascist in the white house  and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day so  do what you do  that s your freedom to do so  but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world featured photo by kevin winter getty images
