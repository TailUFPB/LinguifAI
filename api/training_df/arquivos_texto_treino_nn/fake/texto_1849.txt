sometimes you just need to let people talk and they ll eventually say what you have been saying the whole time  albeit  it may be accidental  and in this case  liberals should take what they can get when it comes to speaker paul ryan  r wi  giving a the perfect argument for medicare for all  they should also not let him forget it while trying to make the affordable care act look bad  ryan accidentally made the perfect argument for medicare for all ryan tweeted out  with another insurer leaving the iowa insurance market  more americans will be left without a choice when it comes to their health care  with another insurer leaving the iowa insurance market  more americans will be left without a choice when it comes to their health care  https   t co   paul ryan   speakerryan  april    follows it up with this  five iowa counties will now be left with just two health insurers  while the rest will only have one option  this is unacceptable  five iowa counties will now be left with just two health insurers  while the rest will only have one option  this is unacceptable   paul ryan   speakerryan  april     first of all  if iowa had set up obamacare properly  they d have their own health exchange and not put you to the national website  this would have also subsequently given iowa insurers the ability to work directly with the state  secondly  when for profit companies are given the ability to mess with people s care for the sake of profit and to try to prove a point that something  isn t working  they will do so thus  when all is said and done  this is the perfect argument for medicare for all  or at least a public option  a public option would provide a guaranteed option for citizens of any state  as well as provide competition in the for profit world of health insurance  which would then drive down costs across the board  yay  true capitalism and not a manipulative market    medicare for all would be ideal  yet not as realistic at the moment  and would provide care to every single american  imagine that  taxes being used for tax payers when all is said and done  we can thank paul ryan for this perfect meme to use against him time and time again  well done  speaker featured photo by olivier douliery getty images
