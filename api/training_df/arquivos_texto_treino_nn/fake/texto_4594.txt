a very pregnant kerry washington appeared on real time with bill maher on friday  and crushed donald trump in a way only a mother could the republican nominee is hoping that women will vote for him because he introduced a child care initiative that supposedly gives paid maternity leave to new mothers  the big problem is that trump doesn t even offer paid maternity leave to his own employees  forcing them to use vacation days and sick days as their unpaid leave  furthermore  donald trump himself is not a fan of pregnancy  once calling it an  inconvenience  so when washington sat down at the table  she was ready to rip trump a new one  there s been a lot of talk about it being insulting to women  but i actually think it s insulting to families   and to workers   because there s no paternity leave  there s no family leave   washington said   for hillary clinton  these issues and these policies are not about women s policies  this is about economic policy  because we understand in this country that if families are able to take care of each other  we do better as a nation  i choose that candidate over the guy who brags about having never changed a diaper  he has literally bragged about never having changed a diaper  that s crazy  indeed  trump made it clear in  that he has never changed a diaper for any of his five kids and claimed that it s because husbands shouldn t do that sort of thing  there s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife  and you know  there s a lot of husbands that listen to that  so you know  they go for it  if i had a different type of wife i probably wouldn t have a baby  ya know  cause that s not my thing  i m really  like  a great father  but certain things you do and certain things you don t  it s just not for me  in fact  trump would rather not do anything to take care of children except provide money  i mean  i won t do anything to take care of them   he added   i ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids  washington wasn t finished with trump yet  however  going on to explain that voting for him would against our best interests  there s a bigger problem  which is right now  we are in a political climate where we are being led by the media   no offense  to vote for the loudest candidate and the meanest  bulliest candidate in the playground  and that we are voting based on a cult of personality or a cult of celebrity rather than voting in our own best interest  i think if we really look at policy  voting for trump is voting against our best interests as americans as workers  as people of color  as women  not voting is voting against ourselves  she also explained why she supports hillary clinton  i would rather vote for the candidate who is willing to address mistakes  address issues  take responsibility  be accountable  be a part of a changed solution rather than a candidate who continues to perpetuate fear and hate in the present moment  here s the video via youtube donald trump can t be trusted do what he says he will do for the country when he can t even be bothered to do those things for the people who work for him featured image via screen capture
