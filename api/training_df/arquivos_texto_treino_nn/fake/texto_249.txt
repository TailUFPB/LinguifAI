donald trump blindsided gop leadership a couple of weeks ago when he struck a deal with senate minority leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi with regards the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca   now  trump seems to  again  be running to his new friends  chuck and nancy  as he calls them   this time on healthcare in an early morning tweet on saturday  trump said that he had spoken with senator schumer regarding some kind of healthcare deal i called chuck schumer yesterday to see if the dems want to do a great healthcare bill  obamacare is badly broken  big premiums  who knows   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     for the longest time  trump has been in an uneasy relationship with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  and house speaker paul ryan  r wi   they tolerated him during the campaign because their mouthbreathing voters decided that an unqualified orange fascist would be a better nominee and president than any of the actually qualified people in the gop primary  and certainly better than any democrat  therefore  the gop leadership had no choice but to watch helplessly as the party of reagan became the party of trump  now  it seems that they have lost control of the frankenstein monster they got elected president  and it seems that their efforts were all for naught trump will be in the oval office schmoozing with chuck and nancy while mcconnell and ryan are stuck out in the cold  looking helplessly as this man once again makes fools of them well  when you make a deal with the devil  you get burned  and chuck and nancy are smart enough to con the con man  and it just might save healthcare for millions of americans featured image via alex wong getty images
