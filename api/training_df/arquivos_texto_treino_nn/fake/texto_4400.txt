the season premiere of nbc s saturday night live  has been a much anticipated event  the show s election based skits have always tended to be among their best  so far this season appears to keep up with that trend  during this premiere  audiences were given a real treat   seeing alec baldwin do his very best impression of donald trump not only did viewers get to see baldwin don the persona of the republican presidential nominee  they also got to see him reenact the recent presidential debate with kate mckinnon playing hillary clinton the two are excellent throughout the skit  it begins with baldwin at the podium introducing himself as trump to the audience  where he says  good evening america  i m going to be so good tonight  i m going to be so calm and so presidential that all of you watching are going to cream your jeans  considering that he is speaking in complete sentences and capable of articulating an actual thought  however bombastic  baldwin s version of trump is doing fairly well compared to the real life version  speaking of amazing entrances  mckinnon also made quite the splash when she entered the stage as clinton  she began by ambling towards the podium while using a cane and coughing  she then abruptly drops the cane and proceeds to do a summersault  when she stands up she says   i m better than ever  let s do this  neither candidate was spared during the sketch  clinton was lampooned for some of her calculated responses   well  lester my opponent s tax plan benefits the top   so much it s not just trickle down economics  it s  i don t know if i had to call it something off of the top of the old dome  with no prep whatsoever  i d call it trumped up trickle down economics   mckinnon responds when asked how she would help grow the economy  the best part about the sketch though is definitely baldwin s take on trump  you cannot help but laugh every time he enunciates the word  china   it s also a pleasure to hear baldwin say things that almost sound as if they the writers imagined what was really going on in trump s head during the debate  such as when baldwin as trump talks about black americans and says  the thing about the blacks is that they re killing each other  all the blacks live one street in chicago  i went there this morning  it s called hell street  that s exactly the type of thing i could see trump saying during a debate  provided he didn t have the number of handlers coaching him as he does now saturday night live  is back and i will certainly be looking forward to watching them satirize this election  you can watch the sketch below featured image via video screenshot
