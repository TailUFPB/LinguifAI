several top republicans have yet to endorse donald trump as the gop presidential nominee  on sunday  republican national committee chair reince priebus had some strong words for those individuals  appearing on cbs  face the nation  priebus issued a thinly veiled threat directed towards those who have yet to get on board the trump bandwagon  which reince described as one of the  biggest movements as far as people across this country in modern history  the right wing reactionary movement is missing key gop politicians such as ted cruz and other former presidential hopefuls  while they may not be considered a part of the  nevertrump crowd  these gopers have not really done much of anything to support the current republican presidential candidate they all agreed to support the eventual presidential nominee no matter who wins the election  and priebus is expecting them to put party before country  we re a private party  we re not a public entity  those people need to get on board   priebus told the show s host  john dickerson   and if they re thinking they re going to run again someday  i think we re going to evaluate the nomination process  and i don t think it s going to be that easy for them  i think these are things that our party s going to look at in the process  i think people who gave us their word  used information from the rnc  should get on board  what s interesting is that trump has previously dragged his feet when it comes to endorsing other gop candidates  such as house speaker paul ryan  it s also interesting to note that the pledge that priebus is referencing was reportedly designed to discourage trump from running as an independent or on a non establishment party campaign  it has no legal significance and is simply just a promise the fact that priebus  had to threaten   though he insists that his comments are not a threat top members of his party show that the gop is still cracking under the weight of trying to hold up trump s campaign  you can watch the video below featured image via video screen capture
