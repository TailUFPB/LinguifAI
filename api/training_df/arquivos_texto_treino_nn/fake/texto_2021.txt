the vast majority of donald trump s campaign promises were both unworkable and  well  hateful  his promise to  lock  hillary clinton  up   was as empty as it was unifying for those on the rabid right  it was the same with his promise to build a wall along the mexican border and his promise to  repeal and replace  obamacare on day one  occasionally  though  like a broken clock  trump occasionally got it right  and now democrats want him to make good on one such promise despite the fact that nearly everything trump adorns with his name is made elsewhere  one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaigns was to force manufacturers to employ americans republicans are doing everything in their power to ensure that trump doesn t get to keep this campaign promise  there s a bill in the senate that would help deliver clean water to americans and help flint  michigan with emergency funding  originally  there was a  buy american and hire american  provision in the bill  that should be non controversial  right  well  republicans  who seem to stand against absolutely everything that s good and right  stripped that part out of the bill back in december  now dems want them to bring it back sen  tammy baldwin  d wis  reintroduced the provision to the bill dem senator to reintroduce  buyamerica legislation  thehill https   t co   sen  tammy baldwin   senatorbaldwin  march    now is the time for president trump to decide if he will keep his promises by supporting this legislation  or will he go along to get along with congressional republicans who have embraced the status quo and blocked this legislation that puts in place a strong buy america standard   said baldwin  who planned to announce the bill at a wisconsin foundry that makes manhole covers for cities throughout the united states   the choice for the republican establishment in washington is clear  do you stand with american manufacturers and workers or do you support spending taxpayer dollars on chinese and russian steel for american water infrastructure projects  source  ib timesdem senator to reintroduce  buyamerica legislation  thehill https   t co   sen  tammy baldwin   senatorbaldwin  march    s bill deals with the drinking water state revolving fund  which in the last two decades has delivered nearly   billion in financing for more than   drinking water projects across the country  her legislation would mandate that moving forward  the program targets its funding to projects that use only american made iron and steel it s unlikely the bill will pass with this provision  but it does put trump s feet to the fire  if he signs the republican version  which he almost certainly will   it will be just more evidence that the emperor has no clothes featured image via alex wong getty images
