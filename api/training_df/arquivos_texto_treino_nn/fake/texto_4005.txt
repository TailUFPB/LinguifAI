donald trump  like any bully  loves to talk crap  but when his victim stands up to him  he always  every single time  backs down  while trump is a bit beyond the age of schoolyard scuffles  don t tell him that   he does like to challenge people who are much smarter than him to intellectual  scuffles   one such smart person is retired col  jeff mccausland  who is a military expert   one trump thinks he can teach  a couple things   mccausland says  bring it on  trump won t mccausland is a visiting professor of international security studies at dickinson university  he s the former dean of the army war college  he s also a retired army colonel  so  yes  he knows a thing or two about military strategy  he says trump doesn t  know a damn thing  about it trump  when asked about it by george stephanopoulos  couldn t leave well enough alone  instead  trump said about mccausland   you can tell your military expert that i ll sit down and i ll teach him a couple of things  mccausland  on dickenson university s website  had a response for trump  i can t wait to sit down with mr  trump and hear what he has to teach me about military strategy  i m happy to compare my record of over  years working in national security affairs with his any time  first  let s review donald trump s record on military strategy  he never served in the military and never served the government  during the primary campaign  mr  trump also made it very clear that he had no understanding of the nuclear triad or nuclear strategy  this is perhaps the most important thing any potential commander in chief needs to understand  he goes on to talk about specifics and how trump is literally wrong about everything  but especially his assertion that mosul is a  disaster  the attack on mosul is turning out to be a total disaster  we gave them months of notice  u s  is looking so dumb  vote trump and win again   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    wrote  when it comes to the question of the mosul offensive  mr  trump doesn t understand that   percent of the troops involved are iraqi  war remains politics by other means  as clausewitz once said  the iraqi government has had a political imperative to publicly state that they would liberate mosul since it was occupied by isis over two years ago  it is the second largest city in the country  and consequently prime minister abadi has had a political imperative to reassure the iraqi people that this was a goal  iraq is a sovereign state  which has always been a goal of u s  policy  so once cities like ramadi or fallujah in southwestern iraq were liberated  everyone knew mosul was next  he also criticized trump s plan to take the oil from iraq  saying that it would take a mind boggling number of troops and would create a lot of casualties  he also says that the population of iraq would never stand for it  why would they  plus  it s a war crime  not that trump cares about that in the end  he simply says   i reassert my statement to the new york times  mr  trump doesn t know a damn thing about military strategy  the fact is  trump has literally zero experience with military strategy  like so many rich kids  he never served in vietnam  in fact  the man who touts his stamina on the campaign trail was excused from the war for having bone spurs on the heels of his feet  trump is dangerous  and as so many have said  he should be allowed within miles of the nuclear codes featured image via dickinson edu
