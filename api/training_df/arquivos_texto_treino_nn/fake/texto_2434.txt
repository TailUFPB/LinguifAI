american taxpayers who expected donald trump to work hard for them are going to be sorely disappointed when they see this trump has spent a full month in office  or  hours and so far  he has very little to show for it  trump is already on track to issue more executive orders than president obama ever did and he is on pace to spend more time on vacation as well according to research by the washington post  donald trump may be the laziest president america has ever had to put up with of the  hours he has spent in office  trump  hours not working while in washington dc   hours golfing   hours tweeting  and  hours at mar a lago  that s a total of  hours of trump not being on the job in contrast  trump has only spent a pathetic six hours in intelligence briefings and only  hours dealing with foreign relations  and can we really count all of the time trump has spent whining about the press and bragging about himself as work time  probably not here s the chart via the washington post trump promised he wouldn t have time to play golf because he would be working so hard  but he is already on pace to surpass the number of rounds president obama played during his first term  trump has also taken three trips to palm beach in florida to stay at his resort at a cost of   million to taxpayers thus far  meaning trump is on pace to shatter the  year   million price tag of president obama s vacations and the number of days president obama spent on vacation within his first year on the job considering how much conservatives whined and bitched about president obama s golfing and vacations  the fact that they haven t complained once about trump s is absolute hypocrisy  compared with obama  trump is much worse and as for those executive orders  trump has signed  so far and that comes out to  this year  which means he ll sign more in two years than president obama did in eight years if he stays on this pace  as we know  conservatives complained every time president obama signed an executive order  claiming that executive orders undermine congress  but apparently  conservatives have no problem with trump acting like a king  and those orders have done nothing but cause chaos and hurt people while keeping government agencies from doing their jobs rather than working for the american people like he claimed he would  trump is treating the most important job in the world like it s not much of a priority  in fact  he only seems interested in tweeting  bragging about himself during press conferences  and playing golf at a time when the world needs steady  hard working leadership  and since trump s  work  has mostly caused chaos  one can hardly say that he is working on behalf of the people  he s only interested in causing more problems and helping himself featured image via drew angerer getty images
