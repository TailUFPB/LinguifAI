buried in trump s bonkers interview with new york times reporters maggie haberman and glenn thrush is this outrageous exchange trump claims happened recently trump   elijah cummings was in my office and he said   you will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country  haberman  really trump  and then he went out and i watched him on television yesterday and i said   was that the same man  which  would have been odd considering cummings  a fiery democratic congressman  has been one of trump s most intense critics  he s very public about it  cummings has been outspoken about trump s disturbing connections to russia  the gop s botched attempts to cover those connections up  and has repeatedly demanded trump divest himself of his numerous conflicts of interest  he hardly sounds like a person who has looked at trump s trainwreck first three months in office and concluded that he deserves to be up on mount rushmore one theory was that trump flatly lied  always a possibility   trump is a pathological liar  another  suggested by writer jamelle bouie  is that trump mixed up two black men  conflating cummings with some other guy  another strong possibility   trump has shown a complete lack of interest in the lives of black americans fortunately  cummings came in to provide the real answer  trump took a criticism cummings has made to his face and filtered it through his unchecked narcissism  here s how cummings describes the meeting trump said was about praising him  during my meeting with the president and on several occasions since then  i have said repeatedly that he could be a great president if   if   he takes steps to truly represent all americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on  note the jab that trump completely missed  if trump stops being  divisive and harmful  he could someday be a great president  so far he has not done so  hasn t even tried   as if to underscore how little trump has tried to stop being divisive  in the same interview he defended bill o reilly for sexually harassing women at fox news  unintentionally  trump s bizarre retelling of what went down during his meeting with cummings exemplifies the warped way trump sees the world  a criticism turns into praise  stripping away all context in the process  it may explain  for example  why trump seems to genuinely believe he saw muslim americans celebrating on    his ego filters everything  facts get distorted and retooled for his own agenda the fact that we have a president who does not seem to understand the difference between reality and the fantasy world that exists in his head is a recipe for disaster  if meetings with a congressman get this distorted  what other delusions is trump living in featured image via win mcnamee getty images
