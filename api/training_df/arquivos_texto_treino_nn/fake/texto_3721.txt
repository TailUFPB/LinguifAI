kansas secretary of state kris kobach has reportedly been in the running for secretary of homeland security  and as an early trump supporter  he s got a pretty good chance of getting a position within the administration on sunday  he had a meeting with trump that lends credence to that assumption  eager for any political opportunity  he appeared in a photograph with overlord trump  and in that photograph  papers concerning his plans for our homeland security can be clearly seen and read here s the picture in question  taken by the associated press in his haste to be photographed with the president elect  he left sensitive information facing directly toward the camera  and as reported by the topeka capital journal  the paper is clearly legible in the original photograph the document calls for updating and reintroducing the national security entry exit registration system  the program was implemented in the wake of the   attacks  but largely suspended in   all aliens from high risk areas are tracked   the document reads the document then calls for  extreme vetting questions  for  high risk aliens   echoing trump s campaign rhetoric  high risk aliens would be questioned about support for sharia law  islamic religious law   jihad  the equality of men and women and the u s  constitution the document also asks for reducing the intake of syrian refugees to zero in other words  trump s current top pick for homeland security wants a registry  wants to violate religious freedoms through extreme vetting  is completely against actually helping anyone  and is too stupid to put the damn papers in the binder before posing for a picture also included in the document  but hidden partially by his arm so that context is unavailable  the patriot act  voter rolls  and possible amendments to the voting rights act  considering trump s rhetoric and what the rest of the paper contains  that is terrifying  it looks as though republicans want to use the department of homeland security to suppress the democratic vote kobach was the one who designed the previous registry system for immigrants as well   the one that was abandoned in  because it was completely useless  and is also un american in concept right off the bat  kobach starts his list by detailing the way he will institute the muslim registry  first  he wants to restart the highly ineffective and civil rights violating bush screening and tracking policy known as  nseers   the program forced muslim immigrants to register and then routinely check in with immigration officials while they were in the us or face jail or deportation  it was also a disaster  obama scrapped the whole thing in his first term   source it didn t even result in a single terrorist being prosecuted  in fact  none of these methods will work beyond appeasing the disgusting impulses of the xenophobic right wing now running our country  alienating communities and painting enemies where there are none does nothing but help the people you re trying to fight  but in the case of fascists like trump  creating an enemy is a good thing  it allows them to justify seizing greater power while they erode civil liberties  mark my words   he will come for the press  for protesters  and even for voters  he doesn t believe in the same basic rights you and i do   he doesn t even understand them in many ways  this incident is a fair representation of the trump campaign  and pending administration  as a whole  incompetent  inhuman  and deeply immoral featured image by drew angerer via getty images
