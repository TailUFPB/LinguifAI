we are  days into   and so far there have been  mass shootings   most done by angry white men with too many guns and with domestic violence issues  it s difficult to spin that fact in any way that doesn t spit in the face of our nation s gun lust  but conservatives try  one even says it s a good thing donald trump called it a mental health issue  one that has no proposed solutions  just days after he called for a complete policy change after an isis connected terrorist plowed into people in new york even trump s tone deaf reaction seemed compassionate compared to a conservative blogger and lutheran pastor who says that god was answering the victims  prayers by taking them to heaven hans fiene wrote his column in the federalist in response to liberals who say that thoughts and prayers are not enough to quell the mass shooting epidemic  god wanted them dead  he said  and that s what prayer is all about when we pray these words  we are certainly praying that god would deliver us from evil temporally that is  in this earthly life  through these words  we are asking god to send his holy angels to guard us from those who would seek to destroy us with knives and bombs and bullets  it may seem  on the surface  that god was refusing to give such protection to his texan children  but we are also praying that god would deliver us from evil eternally  through these same words  we are asking god to deliver us out of this evil world and into his heavenly glory  where no violence  persecution  cruelty  or hatred will ever afflict us again  just like those who put christ to death  and just like those who have brought violence to believers in every generation  this man only succeeded in being the means through which god delivered his children from this evil world into an eternity of righteousness and peace  perhaps instead of eternal damnation  the shooter who murdered  parishioners should receive sainthood featured image via facebook
