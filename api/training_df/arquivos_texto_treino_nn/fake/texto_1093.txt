a pac that claims to support  principled conservative candidates that will lead the fight to restore constitutionally limited government  free markets  and individual liberty to our republic   has released an ad in georgia that appears to link democrat jon ossoff to the shooting of house majority whip steve scalise and left wing violence in general  they call themselves the principled pac  they re acting on behalf of republican karen handel  and if they can put an ad like this together  they re anything but principled they call the left unhinged  and claim that the left endorses and applauds shooting republicans  then it implies that ossoff supports such behavior by saying  when will it stop  it won t if jon ossoff wins on tuesday  because the same unhinged leftists cheering last week s shooting are all backing jon ossoff  and if he wins  they win  it ends with calling on people to vote for karen handel this is the worst example of politicizing a tragedy there is  it s so much worse than conservatives screaming  moar gunz   every single time there s a shooting  and ossoff is sickened by this  he has already responded by saying  the man is fighting for his life  i think it s disgraceful to politicize it  and i think secretary handel should call for it to come down  you have a national tragedy that has united people  there are still  who are in critical condition  it s just got no place in an attack ad  a spokeswoman for handel called it shameful  and said that the so called principled pac should be ashamed of itself  she did not call for the ad to come down  though  as she ought to featured image via joe raedle getty images
