the alt right political movement is not something most mainstream voters know much about  but this year it is imperative that they do  this brand of conservativism is one that is disturbing on many levels  and made up of neo nazis  white nationalists  and other assorted racist extremists  what s more is that steve bannon  head of the insanely bigoted conservative website breitbart  is now heading up donald trump s campaign for president  therefore  hillary clinton is planning to do the people of america a favor this coming thursday and give a speech educating the people on this fringe movement that is definitely a big player in the trump campaign the clinton campaign says of the speech  this  alt right  brand is embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of america which should concern all americans  regardless of party  they go on to remind everyone that trump s entire campaign staff is made up of people who embrace this bigoted garbage  indeed  this is something that used to be on the fringes  in the bowels of the interwebs where only basement dwelling imbeciles who embrace the new white supremacy even knew anything about this largely online  movement  however  donald trump has changed all of that  and empowered these dangerous idiots to come into the light  they see him as an inspiration  they have definitely picked up on trump s dog whistling  after all  we all know that  make america great again   is really just code for  make america white again   despite trump s recent pathetic efforts to reach out to minority voters  we all know what he is really doing   trying to make white people uncomfortable with such blatant racism believe he s just not racist enough for them to be able to pull the lever for him this november thank you  secretary clinton  for this public service  hopefully  people listen featured image via mark makela getty images
