in a shocking turn of events  the trump administration has done something good  i know that s hard to imagine while trump has been working to crackdown on immigration according to the washington post  the trump administration is leaving in place the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  or daca  a program protecting hundreds of thousands young immigrants from deportation  it s also the very same program trump had pledged to eliminate as a presidential candidate crazy  right referred to as  dreamers   these young immigrants arrived in the u s  as small children and raised in the u s  for them there is no recollection of their former home country  to protect these young immigrants from deportation to a land they do not know  the daca program was launched in  and has since protected about   young immigrants from deportation despite trump s vow  homeland security secretary john kelly quietly announced the decision to keep the program at the bottom of a fact sheet released late thursday of course  there s a caveat to this program remaining in place  in the fact sheet  kelly declared the end to deferred action for parents of americans  or dapa  a similar  but never implemented program intended to shield immigrant parents of u s  citizens and legal residents from deportation no idea what made trump and his administration change their mind on daca but thankfully obama s program will remain in place for young immigrants unfortunately  that s not the case for parents dapa was blocked by a federal judge in texas after  states sued  the washington post goes on to say that  republicans saw it as a  backdoor amnesty  and argued that obama overstepped his authority by protecting a specific class of immigrants living in the united states illegally  trump did mention in an associated press interview in april that his administration is  not after the dreamers  we are after the criminals  and  the dreamers should rest easy  if that s the case  the question then becomes  why block it for parents  if they re not criminals  why shouldn t they get protection  too though we have a win  there s still much work to be done featured image via diego g diaz icon sportswire via getty images
