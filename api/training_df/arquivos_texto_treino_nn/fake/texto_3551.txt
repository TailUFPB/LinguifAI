manhattan is seeing significant problems due to trump s insistence on staying in trump tower during his transition  he needs protection  his family needs protection  the tower needs protection  new york city is willing to give extensive help to the secret service to do it  but they can t afford it  and mayor bill deblasio is now asking the federal government for help that help could be to the tune of   million  in addition to the ongoing costs of protecting melania and barron through the end of the school year  and the costs of trump s need to go back to his tacky gilded penthouse as many weekends as he can  thus far  the costs of protecting him in that tower are around   million per day now  sure  president obama  michelle and their daughters needed protection when they were in chicago  hawaii  etc  however  they didn t go back to chicago or hawaii nearly every weekend  and obama took significantly fewer vacation days than george w  bush trump is one of the people who got on obama s case for the taxpayer cost of travels  he claimed that one of obama s trips to new york city cost between   million and   million  politifact rated that statement  pants on fire   because the actual cost was considerably lower  and trump  true to form  had no basis for his outlandish claim mcclatchy went after obama for the price tag of his vacations  which was supposedly upwards of   million  their number came from the right wing group judicial watch  however  that report was published in dec    and that cost was over the course of  years  it s important to note that the obamas themselves paid for all their housing while they were away  in seven years  the obamas cost us roughly twice what trump is going to cost us over the next six weeks by insisting he remain in his poor man s idea of a rich man s apartment through his transition trump has pledged no long vacations  he doesn t count weekends in new york city or even at mar a lago  his palm beach resort  as vacations obviously  but those will add up pretty quickly in terms of taxpayer costs  a   million price tag just between now and january   ridiculous featured image by drew angerer via getty images
