it s bad enough they were even allowed to step foot in the white house but sarah palin  kid rock  and ted nugent also decided to stand in front of hillary clinton s portrait and completely disrespect it when two gay activists raised their middle fingers toward ronald reagan s white house portrait a few years ago  conservatives threw a collective temper tantrum over it  they complained for days about the utter lack of respect shown toward reagan  of course  reagan s inaction during the aids epidemic during his presidency understandably angers many people however  two gay activists from philadelphia is not the same as three people who are public figures  nugent and kid rock are both musicians and palin is a former vice presidential candidate as such  they are and should be held to a higher standard sarah palin was invited to the white house by donald trump  who told her to bring some friends  for some reason  she chose nugent  a man who shit his pants to avoid serving his country in vietnam and later wrote an ode to pedophilia  and robert ritchie  kid rock   an alcoholic who has committed assault and battery and has a sex tape seriously  these people got to pal around in the oval office  it s disgraceful but the trio did more than that  instead of just acting like adults for the day  they decided to act like complete jackasses by mocking hillary clinton s white house portrait  hillary clinton has a white house portrait because she was the first lady  and a classy first lady at that  unlike melania trump  whom you can find nude photos of simply by running a search on google in the photo  nugent holds his thumb out as if to say clinton is  outta here  while palin had a look of disgust on her face  ritchie merely folded his arms across his chest in disdain here s the photo via facebook of course  conservatives are cheering about this utter lack of disrespect even though they would have thrown a massive hissy fit had three liberal celebrities done the same to a portrait of a republican first lady most americans  however  did not appreciate palin and her friends  disrespect of a former first lady again  sarah palin is a quitter and grifter who will never work in the white house  ted nugent is a racist who has a thing for underage girls  and kid rock is the poster boy for who the war on drugs should be waged against  donald trump degraded the white house by inviting these three losers to visit and he should be ashamed of himself for once again demonstrating why america is a laughingstock around the world featured image  facebook
