while londoners were coming together in a show of courage and compassion for the victims of a terror attack  an intrepid breitbart writer decided it would be a good time to exploit the tragedy to promote her racist  white nationalist ideology in the immediate aftermath of the attack  katie mchugh tweeted there would be no deadly terror attacks in the u k  if muslims didn t live there   londonbridge  katie mchugh     kmcq  june     when a user pointed out that she was an idiot  she responded by dismissing him because he was  indian    he was right  she was wrong  he is an iranian american actor  she really is an idiot  what followed was even more ranting about muslims  a seemingly endless stream of hate directed at an entire religion which katie loathes  even by breitbart s standards  it was openly racist  cnn contacted several anonymous employees of the right wing website and they expressed disgust in their coworker  i find it appalling   one breitbart employee told cnn  it s a terrible comment   another breitbart employee told cnn  saying it was wrong to make a blanket statement about an entire religious group   i would never write what she said   note  these employees shouldn t get too much credit  how sad is it that they wanted their names to be hidden before they said something so straightforward as  racism is bad   things only got worse for mchugh as people went digging into her history of racism  she has been proudly boasting of her islamophobia for years  including disgusting attacks like this one   also while she was employed at breitbart one day later and breitbart finally caved to the pressure and fired katie for the bigoted remarks   like at fox news   has been a bit of a bloodbath for breitbart  before this scandal  they were forced to fire their star personality  milo yiannopoulos for endorsing child rape  but in an added twist of hypocrisy  katie has now launched a crowdfunding page  hosted by a white nationalist run website  wesearchr   in which she begs for handouts to make ends meet while she s unemployed  the breitbarter wants your welfare please donate here so i can pay my medical bills and get employed again  and keep telling the truth  https   t co   londonbridge  katie mchugh     kmcq  june    fact that she needs money to pay her medical bills is particularly rich coming from a breitbart employee  the website ran relentless attack ads disguised as  news  to stop universal healthcare from happening  to this day  the site supports a repeal of obamacare   the same insurance pool that would allow mchugh to have health insurance even if she can t find a website to hire her after her racism went viral and naturally  mchugh is spinning her dismissal from breitbart as a conspiracy to silence her conservative views mchugh wanted a raise for tweeting  there would be no deadly terror attacks  if muslims didn t live there  to quote an iranian american actor you re a real moron  pej vahdat   pejvahdat  june    image via twitter
