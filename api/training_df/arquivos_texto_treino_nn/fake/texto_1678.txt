if you have a pre existing condition  obamacare currently protects you from being turned down for insurance on the basis of that condition  republicans want to take that away because insuring sick people just eats too much profit  and healthcare is a privilege  not a right anyway  the latest iteration of their ridiculous healthcare plan will allow states to decide whether insurers have to cover people with pre existing conditions  because of course it does  but it also contains a brand new amendment that s patently disgusting it carves an exemption out for members of congress and their staffs  insurers would still be required to provide coverage for them regardless of pre existing conditions  vox confirmed it last night  a spokesperson for rep  tom macarthur  r n j   who authored this amendment confirmed this was the case  members of congress and their staff would get the guarantee of keeping these obamacare regulations  but don t republicans hate obamacare  well  their relationship with obamacare is actually considerably more complex than we tend to give it credit for  contrary to popular belief  we taxpayers don t subsidize congress  health insurance the way many people think  in fact  we never did  until   they were covered under the federal employee health benefits program  which is a health insurance marketplace where they  and every other federal employee  purchase health insurance with all the same bullshit as everyone else  and have their premiums taken out of their paychecks the office of personnel management contributes to each employee s premium  but where private sector employers cover an average of  percent of their employees  premiums  or  percent for family plans   opm covers  to  percent  whichever is less depending on a variety of factors  across the board in   all of congress was kicked off of fehb thanks to sen  chuck grassley  r ia   he proposed an amendment to the aca that would require all members of congress to purchase health insurance through the exchanges  and for their staffs under the small business provision so that s what they ve been doing for health insurance for the last four years  where their own lives are concerned  obamacare s popular provisions are good things  where the rest of the country is concerned  though  well  we all know how they feel about the rest of us  the prohibition on denying insurance due to pre existing conditions is one of the most popular provisions and they want to gut it for everyone but themselves can they get any more obvious about where their true priorities lie featured image by mark wilson via getty images
