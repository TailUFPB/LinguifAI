the name donald trump will get women   to buy birth control   at least that s the promotion being offered by a new startup app called nurx  which prescribes and provides birth control with or without a doctor and with or without insurance if you mention the name  donald trump   you ll receive   toward birth control  this promotion is in response to trump s promises to repeal obamacare  which helps provide free birth control to millions of women  unfortunately  nurx only operates in california  new york  washington state and washington  d c   so if you live outside those areas  you won t be able to participate  donald trump has said repeatedly that he wants to repeal the affordable care act  and that would mean that millions of women would lose access to free birth control   hans gangeskar  ceo and cofounder of nurx  said in a statement  this motivated us to figure out a way to help make contraception even more accessible  source  business insiderwhile no one knows for sure what trump will do with obamacare  his cabinet picks and his vice presidential pick don t bode well for women s health  vice president elect mike pence is virulently anti woman  this is what pence had to say about trump in october  the trump pence administration will be dedicated to preserving the liberties of our people  including the freedom of religion that s enshrined in our bill of rights   trump s vice presidential nominee said when asked if their administration would issue a regulation to eliminate obamacare s contraceptive mandate  or at least provide a religious exemption for all ministries and businesses we have a long tradition of accommodating religious beliefs in this country  the governor adds   our administration is going to err on the side of freedom  we re going to err on the side of protecting our liberties of our people  source  christian postthe evangelical to english translation of that is that his right to discriminate is more important than a woman s liberty more importantly  and simply because the vice president doesn t create laws  congress is now majority christian conservative  while they may not overturn obamacare completely  they will continue to demonize planned parenthood and anyone who specializes in women s health  they will also  i m sure  demonize women who are sexually active  at least companies like nurx are being proactive  look for them to be next on republicans  radar featured image via mark wilson getty images
