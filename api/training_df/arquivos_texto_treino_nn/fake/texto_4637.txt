republican presidential nominee donald trump touts his business prowess as his number one reason he will be great for working people should he be elected president of the united states  however  thanks to a group of creditors that trump stiffed while he was busy destroying atlantic city s economy  we are now privy to a very different story than the one trump s been peddling on the campaign trail we all know that trump built extravagant and ridiculously gaudy and expensive casinos in atlantic city  new jersey  this meant hiring many contractors to put the places together  one such contractor was forest jenkins  father of beth rosser  who was interviewed with others in similar positions on anderson cooper  rosser says  it was like we won the lottery   when her father landed a    contract to help install toilet partitions in the taj mahal casino  forest s son  steven jenkins  echo s rosser s claims  saying  it was a big job  it was great  we were all excited  i had the fuzz from those carpets on the wheels of my dolly for months after that job  however  things quickly went downhill for the small business when trump didn t pay them  steven says of the devastating loss  we weren t this big company  we didn t have tons of money in an account somewhere to cover things  the company was forest jenkins  life s work  and he made it grow from the ground up  trump s stiffing them almost cost them all that work though  luckily  they somehow survived  and beth and steven now operate the company since their father s passing  trump stiffed the jenkins family in   and then he filed bankruptcy on the taj mahal three years later and ran off with millions trump owed the jenkins family     and they only got      and that was only after a years long court battle trying to force trump to pay up  beth rosser says of her feelings regarding trump today  it s  years later  i grit my teeth every time i see him on television blustering about what a wonderful businessman he is  he stepped on a lot of people  of course  the jenkins  story is only the beginning  nat hyman is also a victim of donald trump  in   hyman went into the snake s den when he managed to land a plum of a spot to begin selling jewelry from his fledgling company   a kiosk in a great spot right in trump tower  after having success with his new company  landau jewelry  in trump tower  hymen was able to expand into trump s casinos  that s when the trouble started trump began making baseless claims that hyman was selling shoddy products  and to that end tried to force him to leave trump tower and go other places where he would never be able to make a living  when hyman refused to give up the spot in the trump tower lobby  trump lashed out by pulling the plug on hyman s ability to set up shop in the casinos  he also wound up having trump s lawyers sicced on him  hyman says  of his ordeal  i think i spent over a million dollars in litigation with him  i tried to stand up to him everywhere i could but it s exhausting  and it s silly  to him  it s a sport  to him  it s fun  after hyman was finally done with his spot in trump tower  of course  he was replaced with trump s own merchandise paul friel s family business is another that fell into the black hole that is working with donald trump  his family was hired to install structures for slot machines  desks  and the like in one of trump s casinos  however   surprise  surprise   trump bought the contract out from under the general contractor he had hired and refused to pay  paul friel is the company s founder s grandson  and says his father lost his business over what donald trump did  he says of the experience  we had already worked for three  general contractors   and every single one of them lived up to their word until donald trump came to atlantic city  that s not all  either   trump used his pull in atlantic city to blackball the company  and it worked  despite their stellar reputation  after attempting to deal with being taken for a ride by trump  the elder friel s company went bankrupt  paul friel says  i think it surprised him the most that donald trump had blackballed him   even though we had an excellent name in atlantic city he was devastated  the fact that we had seen such a huge future in atlantic city for his business that all of a sudden because of one deal   his business in atlantic city was done  edward friel died in   but paul friel is determined to be his voice  he says of his late father  he would say   paul  do this for us let the country know what kind of man this is  here is video of the segment donald trump often brags about his business record  but some small business owners say his tactics cost them  https   t co   anderson cooper       september     i guarantee you that these are not the only ones trump stiffed  they are just the only ones brave enough to speak out  after all  speaking out against donald trump has had disastrous consequences for many people  they have a right to be afraid  however  if these stories are any indication  i think we can all pretty much figure that the only person donald trump cares about is donald trump  and it would an absolute national emergency to put the future of our nation and the free world in his hands featured image via video screen capture
