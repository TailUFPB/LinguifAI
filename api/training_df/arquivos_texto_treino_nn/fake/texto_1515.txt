legendary journalist dan rather has become a major critic of donald trump and the gop  and if there s anyone who should be commenting on the firing of fbi director james comey  it s him on msnbc s hardball with chris matthews  rather weighed in on trump s shady behavior in firing comey right as the russia investigation was heating up  in his appearance  rather said he wanted the republican party to take a good look at themselves and figure out why they refused to hold trump accountable when it s blatantly obvious that this is a cover up in speaking with matthews  rather called trump s termination of comey a  smoke screen  and stated that the russia scandal needs to be done by an independent commission with a special prosecutor  which many people are calling for  rather said    it s smoke screen  it s cover  i ll be very surprised if it fools very many among the american people    what s needed here are some republican leaders  republicans have the white house  they have the supreme court  they have the congress  this is going to require some republican officeholders with guts who say to themselves   i want the trump administration to succeed  i want my party to succeed  but more importantly  i want to do what s good for the country   and they know  in that secret place behind their hearts that what s good for the country is an independent  bipartisan commission with a special prosecutor  rather has always nailed it when it comes to analyzing trump  and he did it again  it s obvious that comey s firing was meant to be a distraction  and everyone seems to acknowledge this except for the gop  the republican party s tendency to look the other way and protect their own is hurting the country and will have serious consequences if something is not done immediately the best thing republicans can do now is act like grown ups and forget about getting one over on the democrats so that trump s issues can be dealt with  america s democracy cannot be played with  and should not be compromised because the gop refuses to work with others  if they cannot  an independent commission is america s only hope for trump to be held accountable you can watch rather tear the gop to shreds below dan rather to republicans  show some guts and hold trump accountable for this cover up pic twitter com   sean colarossi   seancolarossi  may    image via frederick m  brown getty images
