ben and jerry  the  ber liberal vermont ice cream guys  are no fans of donald trump and in a blistering and sarcastic op ed  they sarcastically explained how pulling out of the paris climate treaty was the right thing to do the op ed  on their website  is tongue in cheek  but also bitter  a terrible suggestion for a ben   jerry s flavor   they talk about the jobs that will be lost we hear china is ramping up their renewable energy production and it sure looks like a lot of work  beijing alone plans to invest   billion in renewables by   creating more than  million jobs  but jobs are work  work is hard  it s so much easier to luxuriate in the status quo  driving our fossil fuel powered cars and enjoying our coal created electricity like we always have it s also quite personal for them  the cost of cocoa beans and vanilla will rise dramatically over the coming years then  there s the fact that we are one of only three countries who have chosen not to participate  that means we will no longer have a seat at the table and it means that for all intents and purposes  we can no longer call ourselves a superpower ben   jerry go on to talk about the wonderful ocean views we ll all soon have who doesn t love oceanfront property  with runaway climate change melting glaciers and causing sea levels to rise at unprecedented rates  a whole lot more of us could be seeing waves from our bedroom windows  sure  some folks might lose their homes and businesses  and our coastal cities could see devastating changes  but a whole lot of people will also be able to learn how to surf right in their backyards  sounds like a fair tradeoff to us they also look forward to the impending world crises  which make  life exciting  we can see it now     million us homes flooded   boat sales surge    world refuses to cooperate with us foreign policy  us sulks like angsty teenager   and  hundreds of plants and animals now extinct  us says  we never liked polar bears anyway  then  there s the fact that the world is ready to take the reins  with or without us  we are the second largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and we are leaving it up to everyone else to clean up our messes featured image via theimpulsiovebuy flickr
