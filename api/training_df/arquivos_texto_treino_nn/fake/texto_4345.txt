the atlantic is a well respected american publication  it also is one that tries with all its might to not be partisan when it comes to reporting on presidential politics  for this reason  the atlantic usually refuses to endorse presidential candidates  the magazine has existed since   and prides itself on being fact based  morally sound  and non partisan for the most part  they actually took sides for the first time in endorsing then republican candidate for president abraham lincoln  due to his position on slavery  to that endorsement  the paper said its reasoning for endorsing lincoln was clear  a moral objection to slavery  the paper said of this endorsement one of the animating causes of this magazine at its founding  in   was the abolition of slavery  and lowell argued that the republican party  and the man who was its standard bearer in   represented the only reasonable pathway out of the existential crisis then facing the country  in his endorsement of abraham lincoln for president  lowell wrote  on behalf of the magazine   it is in a moral aversion to slavery as a great wrong that the chief strength of the republican party lies   he went on to declare that abraham lincoln  had experience enough in public affairs to make him a statesman  and not enough to make him a politician  the second time the atlantic endorsed a candidate for president also had to do with racism  when the endorsement for lyndon b  johnson was announced  the atlantic s position then was  once again  less of a glowing heap of praise for johnson  but rather against barry goldwater s rank racism  then editor edward weeks wrote at the time  we admire the president for the continuity with which he has maintained our foreign policy  a policy which became a worldwide responsibility at the time of the marshall plan  the magazine went on to write that president johnson would deliver to america the solution  to the vexed problem of civil rights a power of conciliation which will prevent us from stumbling down the road taken by south africa   they went on to say of the known racist candidate they saw in barry goldwater we think it unfortunate that barry goldwater takes criticism as a personal affront  we think it poisonous when his anger betrays him into denouncing what he calls the  radical  press by bracketing the new york times  the washington post  and izvestia  there speaks not the reason of the southwest but the voice of joseph mccarthy  we do not impugn senator goldwater s honesty  we sincerely distrust his factionalism and his capacity for judgment and now  when faced with the possibility of a bigoted  dangerous demagogue as president  the atlantic once again has taken a stand and endorsed democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  again  this has more to do with the dangers of a trump administration than it has to do with hillary herself  while the good folks at the atlantic had plenty of praise for hillary s public service record  their public endorsement is definitely focused on the indisputable dangers of donald trump  they said  in part donald trump  on the other hand  has no record of public service and no qualifications for public office  his affect is that of an infomercial huckster  he traffics in conspiracy theories and racist invective  he is appallingly sexist  he is erratic  secretive  and xenophobic  he expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers  and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself  he is easily goaded  a poor quality for someone seeking control of america s nuclear arsenal  he is an enemy of fact based discourse  he is ignorant of  and indifferent to  the constitution  he appears not to read this judgment is not limited to the editors of the atlantic  a large number in fact  a number unparalleled since goldwater s  campaign of prominent policy makers and officeholders from the candidate s own party have publicly renounced him  trump disqualified himself from public service long before he declared his presidential candidacy  in one of the more sordid episodes in modern american politics  trump made himself the face of the so called birther movement  which had as its immediate goal the demonization of the country s first african american president  trump s larger goal  it seemed  was to stoke fear among white americans of dark skinned foreigners  he succeeded wildly in this  the fear he has aroused has brought him one step away from the presidency the atlantic s editors are right to do this  trump is dangerous  the fact that a non partisan  widely respected publication that has only taken sides in presidential politics three times since  has such strong words against one major party candidate and in favor of another is very telling  they are telling us something that we should already know  a donald trump presidency isn t just embarrassing  or even just bigoted  it would be a reckless and dangerous affair that would literally amount to a national and international emergency sure  independents and others who aren t necessarily on team hillary might have legitimate reasons for not taking the word of a clear clinton supporter such as myself seriously  but you surely can  if only for a second  take a step back and consider the opinions of a paper like the atlantic featured image via alex wong getty images
