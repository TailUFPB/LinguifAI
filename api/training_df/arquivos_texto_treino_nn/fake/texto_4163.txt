a republican new york times writer just jumped ship from the gop to become a democrat because of republican cowardice to unendorse donald trump josh barro  who is also the senior editor at business insider  penned a column explaining why he switched parties and he did not hold back  the most important thing we have learned this year is that  when the republican party was hijacked by a dangerous fascist who threatens to destroy the institutions that make america great and free  most republicans up and down the organizational chart stood behind him and insisted he ought to be president   barro began before focusing on republicans who support trump despite how dangerous he is to our country specifically  he called out ted cruz  marco rubio  and house speaker paul ryan for standing by trump anyway  for reasons of strategy  careerism  or cowardice  referring to them as  cowards and scoundrels   barro points to these three as the primary reason he has left the party he grew up supporting  they are taking an action that risks the destruction of the american republic to advance their personal interests   barro wrote   i can only conclude from the available evidence that they love their careers more than they love america  and they are why i quit the republican party this week  barro explained that he has been a republican for a long time because he didn t  think it was ridiculous to be in a party that i disagreed with on a lot of national issues  he had hoped to help bring change to the republican party from within  to  improve ideas at the margin in the long run   but what this election has made clear is that policy is not the most important problem with the republican party   barro said indeed  republicans are only really interested in power  which is why republican leaders have thrown in their lot with trump  they are hoping trump will be a puppet who will pass all of their agenda  which would basically burn the government to the ground and usher in a completely ideologically pure conservative government barro went on to describe the  fundamental vulnerability  of the gop because of the fact free environment so many of its voters live in  and because of the anti democrat hysteria that had been willfully whipped up by so many of its politicians  it was possible for the party to be taken over by a fascist promising revenge and because there are only two major parties in the united states  and either of the parties  nominees can become president  such a vulnerability in the republican party constitutes a vulnerability in our democracy  i can t be a part of an organization that creates that kind of risk   barro said considering part of the republican agenda includes voter suppression and stripping civil rights away from women and minorities  barro is spot on with his observation he has also concluded that while moderate republicans may try to wrestle the soul of the party back from the  conspiracy nuts and proto fascists  that have taken it over  he believe they  will fail  and he refuses to  stick around to watch  barro is definitely not alone  many republicans have been jumping ship because of donald trump  and on election day  we will find out just exactly how much the republican party has been damaged by this exodus  because if trump loses by a landslide and down ticket gop candidates get their asses handed to them  it will be such a disaster for the party that they will have no choice  they will have to change or go extinct featured image  baystateconservativenews com
