while donald trump and kellyanne conway continue to boast about how uplifting and fair the billionaire mogul has been to his female employees  hiring  promotions  large salaries   court documents obtained from the los angeles times paint a more sinister  misogynistic view into how trump really felt about female employees in other words  it highlights exactly the kind of person trump is and just how he treats women according to the court documents  hayley strozier  director of catering at the trump national golf club in rancho palos verdes  accused trump of asking managers to fire  unattractive  waitresses and replacing them with  attractive  ones instead i had witnessed donald trump tell managers many times while he was visiting the club that restaurant hostesses were  not pretty enough  and that they should be fired and replaced with more attractive women other court documents from  document that trump had asked sue kwiatkowski that his premises in los angeles should showcase only  attractive  women donald trump always wanted good looking women working at the club  i know this because one time he took me aside and said   i want you to get some good looking hostesses here  people like to see good looking people when they come in   i and the other managers always tried to have our most attractive hostesses working when mr  trump was in town and going to be on the premises in donald trump s america  a woman is not judged on her merit and ability to get the job done  but by her looks   and if she doesn t have the looks  she s out of a job  because of trump s ridiculous and sexist demands  managers were often forced to hire inexperienced  inept employees due to looks over the experienced  capable employees who didn t fit the mold of  attractive  enough the outrage lies within one caveat  he only did this with female employees  not males  either trump thinks all men are drop dead gorgeous or he really does have a blatant disregard for treating women with respect and it s not like the ill deeds towards these women did not go unpunished  as part of a  broader labor relations lawsuit   which includes other complaints than sexist mistreatment   trump had to compensate the bulk of the lawsuit was settled in   when golf course management  without admitting any wrongdoing  agreed to pay    to employees who had complained about break policies  an employee s claim that she was fired after complaining about the company s treatment of women was settled separately  its terms remain confidential if trump really treated women with respect  why did he have to give hush money to a female employee who complained about ill treatment of not just her  but women overall maybe someone should tell kellyanne conway before the next time she starts babbling on about how great he is featured image via spencer platt getty images
