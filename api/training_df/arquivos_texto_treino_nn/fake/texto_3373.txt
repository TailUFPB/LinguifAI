this is the kind of power grab that justifies armed rebellion the north carolina gubernatorial race was a close win for democrat roy cooper but a win nonetheless even though his republican opponent pat mccrory challenged the results in every way possible to hang onto power and because cooper won  republicans in the state legislature called a special session in order to pass a bunch of petty bills designed to cripple his administration before it has even begun senate bill  is designed to merge the ethics and elections boards into one body and would change the overall makeup of the combined board so that republicans control the whole thing  current law gives democrats the majority because cooper is going to be governor  and the governor is able to make the majority of the appointments to the board  mccrory had this power himself  but he signed sb  to strip it away from cooper furthermore  republicans also passed house bill  requiring state senate approval for cooper s cabinet picks  which means the state of north carolina will likely be denied leadership in various state agencies because republicans will more than likely refuse to approve of anyone cooper picks  mccrory has yet to make a decision about that piece of legislation republicans also gave mccrory the power to appoint a member of the industrial commission to a six year term instead of his appointment only being allowed to fill the remaining term of a commissioner who resigned due to health issues  and he picked the wife of his chief of staff to fill the seat  the commission hears appeals of worker compensation cases  so mccrory s pick serves as a  f ck you  to workers across the state furthermore  another bill would slash cooper s staff from   employees to   a move that would cripple the governor s office protesters stormed the statehouse over the last two days to voice opposition to the power grab  which is basically a coup  but as usual  republicans ignored the protests and passed the bills anyway because they are petty losers  you can bet that had mccrory won the race republicans would not be passing or even proposing any of these bills  they are only doing it to sabotage cooper these petty moves by republicans are unconstitutional and should be declared null and void by the courts  the people of north carolina should be enraged by what has happened here  and if these new laws are allowed to stand republicans had better prepare themselves for the retribution that will occur when democrats retake the legislature  because turnabout is fair play featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
