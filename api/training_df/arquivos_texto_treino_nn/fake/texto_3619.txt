immigration was one of the biggest  most divisive issues during president elect donald trump s presidential campaign  not only did he help spark more racism by calling mexican immigrants  drug dealers  and  rapists   but his constant promise to build a wall along the u s  mexico border and deport undocumented immigrants was a threat that many of his supporters clung to now that trump has won the election  he will actually have to try and deliver that ridiculous promise  already  it looks like he will not only have to contend with resistance from the democrats   he ll have to fight with the republican party as well  politico reports that gop sens  lindsey graham and jeff flake are teaming up with democrats to create legislation that would protect approximately   young undocumented immigrants from one of trump s deportation schemes  in reference to trump s threat to deport undocumented immigrants that were given protection and work permits under a  executive order issued by president barack obama  politico reported  but should trump follow through on that promise  some key lawmakers on capitol hill want to make sure those protections stay in place for the immigrants who willingly gave personal information to the federal government and went through background checks  one big fear among advocates is that the trump administration could use that personal information to track down the immigrants to deport them  graham  who has been a massive critic of trump since day one  commented on the legislation and said  the worst outcome is to repeal the legal status that these kids have  whether you agree with them having it or not  they ve come out of the shadows   going to be basically  if you have legal status  you ll continue legal status  i think it would pass overwhelmingly  of course  we can t be sure that trump will actually sign this into law when he s president  as this legislation likely won t be up for discussion until next year  althought it goes against everything he s been saying in his campaign  trump is notorious for his random flip flopping  maybe with enough pressure  he will abandon his promises  again  featured image via alex wong getty images
