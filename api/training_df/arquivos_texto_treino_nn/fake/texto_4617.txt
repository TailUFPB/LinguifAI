hillary clinton shocked america a few days ago when she was forced to leave the   memorial in new york city early  only to have her campaign announce that the former secretary of state had been diagnosed with pneumonia shortly after while dr  bennet omalu isn t a household name for many of us  omalu is the well respected forensic pathologist and neuropathologist that was responsible for discovering chronic traumatic encephalopathy  cte  in dead nfl players  this discovery made omalu an inspiration for the nfl film concussion where omalu s character was played by actor will smith with that being said  when a famous doctor gives his medical opinion  people are going to pay attention   and when omalu weighed in on clinton s illness last sunday  it definitely raised some eyebrows  omalu tweeted that he sensed there was a possibility that clinton was being poisoned  by none other than her political rival  donald trump  and his best friend russian president vladimir putin  he tweeted  i must advice the clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of ms  clinton s blood  it is possible she is being poisoned  twittera little less than an hour later  omalu followed his statement up with a second tweet announcing just who he thought might be behind clinton s illness  he said  i do not trust mr  putin and mr  trump  with those two all things are possible  twitterwhile it s been a common thought that putin and trump might be working together  the suggestion that they might be poisoning clinton has certainly never been publicly stated before  twitter reacted to omalu s thoughts with some skepticism  however omalu s credentials and tenacity are well known and people are interested in what he has to say interestingly enough  the man who has something to say about anything and everything has yet to respond to this accusation  trump has been oddly silent about omalu s tweets what do you think of omalu s suggestion featured image via pete marovich   getty images
