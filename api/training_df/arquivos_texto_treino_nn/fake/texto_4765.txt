on sunday  former cnn host soledad o brien appeared on cnn s reliable sources  where she claimed that cnn and the mainstream media in general  have helped donald trump normalize white supremacy through their coverage of his campaign  if you look at hillary clinton s speech where she basically pointed out that what donald trump has done   actually quite well   has normalized white supremacy  i think she made a very good argument  almost like a lawyer  here are ways in which he has actually worked to normalize conversations that many people find hateful i ve seen on air  white supremacists being interviewed because they are trump delegates  and they do a five minute segment  the first minute or so talking about what they believe as white supremacists  so you have normalized that  o brien continued to voice her objections to the type of coverage the press has given trump over the course of his campaign run  saying  donald trump will say   hillary clinton  she s a bigot   and it s covered  the journalist part comes in   they trade barbs  he said she s a bigot and she points out that he might be appealing to racists   it only becomes  he said  she said   when in actuality  the fact that donald trump said she s a bigot without the long laundry list of evidence  which if you looked at hillary clinton s speech  she actually did have a lot of really good factual evidence that we would all agree that are things that have happened and do exist  they are treated as if they are equal  o brien is voicing critiques of the media that have come up recently regarding the way media organizations handle their bias towards objectivity  similar criticisms of mainstream media companies have arisen in the past over a wide variety of issues   most notably  when covering issues relating to climate change  for example  in an effort to appear objective  news and editorial shows will have a climate scientist come on their program as well as a climate change denier it isn t at all fair to have a climate change denier be given airtime when they represent an incredibly small fraction of the population of experts  especially when you take into consideration that their views are generally considered to be demonstrably false by all available scientific evidence the same goes for trump and those involved with his campaign  they represent an overall tiny segment of population   keep in mind that less than   of the eligible u s  population voted for any candidate in the presidential primary   and they generally have put out views that are hateful and even bizarre you can watch the video of the exchange below featured image via video screen capture
