has anybody ever wondered whether all these acts of war  including the moab we just dropped on afghanistan  are just distractions from the growing russia scandal  considering the fact that he won t say whether he actually authorized the moab strike  it s not too far fetched to wonder if this was to distract us from news that our intelligence community may have concrete information showing his campaign colluded with russia during the election but the moab we just dropped on afghanistan may not be all  trump is threatening north korea  too  in a more direct way than saying   see my giant penis bomb  you shouldn t mess with me  we already sent a strike force across the pacific to intimidate kim jong un  who s been shooting missiles into the sea of japan lately  north korea is now talking about conducting a nuclear test within the next few days  and the trump administration has threatened to hit them with tomahawks if they do so but that s not all   there may well be an attempt to get  boots on the ground  in north korea as well the intelligence officials told nbc news that the u s  has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting tomahawk cruise missiles in the region  one just  miles from the north korean nuclear test site american heavy bombers are also positioned in guam to attack north korea should it be necessary  and earlier this week  the pentagon announced that the uss carl vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area the u s  strike could include missiles and bombs  cyber and special operations on the ground because that s totally the way to cow a foreign power  north korea has warned that if we launch a pre emptive strike against them  they could launch a nuke at us  hot air  maybe  but it would be better for trump to take it seriously than strut around with his penis peacock feathers on full display right up until they actually do it if dropping the biggest non nuclear bomb in our arsenal isn t enough to scare them  then nothing will be  if we launch missiles at north korea in a pre emptive strike for a nuclear test  we ve committed an act of war  and no matter how we justify it  we ve made ourselves a threat to the entire world by provoking a nuclear power and north korea may or may not retaliate directly against us  while they ve threatened to  hit the u s  first   with a nuke should we strike  they might decide to hit south korea  or even japan  in retaliation for such an attack  in fact  japan is worried that north korea could send missiles tipped with sarin gas warheads their way  sarin gas is the gas that assad used on his people last week in other words  trump s aggressive actions have consequences he doesn t seem to understand  he s a macho peacock strutting around trying to convince the world that he s a bad ass with a giant penis military at his disposal  our military is not a toy  and bombs are not a toy  and neither are signals of strength in the situations in which trump is using them  he needs to go  he s the biggest threat to the world we ve seen in decades featured image via mark wilson getty images
