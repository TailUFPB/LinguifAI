donald trump reverted to his usual grouchy  unlikable self in another twitter meltdown on saturday  ripping into both maureen dowd of the new york times and the paper itself  dowd told cnn that trump once told her that the violence at his rallies adds excitement  and the times ran a separate piece on the nearly   billion in tax breaks trump s real estate empire got from the state of new york  both seem to have hurt trump s widdle feewings in this latest meltdown of his  he posted the following tweet my lawyers want to sue the failing  nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent  i said no  for now   but they are watching  really disgusting  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    s a load of hogwash if there ever was one  first off   irresponsible intent  isn t a crime and his lawyers ought to know that  if they don t  they re terrible lawyers   this is something that trump himself just made up to sound smart besides  if it were a crime he likely would have been locked up for all eternity already secondly  trump is sue happy to the point that he often gets what he wants in business simply by threatening to sue those who don t do what he wants  he hates the press and has banned outlets from his rallies  in addition to saying he ll  open up libel laws  after he s elected so that we can sue the media and  win lots of money  this also isn t the first time trump s lawyers have threatened to sue the times  earlier this year  the times ran a story with quotes from an old girlfriend  who later claimed they misrepresented her badly  for its part  the times issued a statement saying she was quoted accurately  fairly  and at length  trump s lawyers withdrew their lawsuit threat so it s not especially likely that trump doesn t want his lawyers to sue now   it s more likely that tweet is a showy lie  he wants to make the threat  but he might want to make it look like he s got hard hitting lawyers that are somewhat roguish  whom he has to rein in  he s conniving and his image is everything  this might make him look like he s in control as for us  we can see right through him featured image by joe raedle getty images
