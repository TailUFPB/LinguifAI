when ella dawson started a blog discussing her trials with genital herpes  along with sti stigma  she expected prudes to come out of the woodwork and snipe at her for putting such a personal topic out for all to see  what she didn t expect was for the dangerous alt right to find her and make her a target for their sick form of entertainment when she decided to write about that  she likely also didn t expect to catch the attention of hillary clinton  let alone grab it enough to receive a personal letter back the letter starts with  thank you for the brave and insightful piece on medium this week  i am so grateful for you for not only speaking out against the stigma surrounding sexually transmitted infections  but for also taking a courageous stand against the ridiculous  but very real  barrage of hate you have received online  she reiterated that love and kindness are among the central components of her campaign  and that the decline of civil public discourse is one of the more alarming problems in the digital age  then she dropped this truth bomb  it s going to take all of us  working together  to restore our discourse and that work starts by calling out the bullies  chief among them donald trump and the alt right  read the whole letter below thank you   hillaryclinton  for reading  i m incredibly moved  to be accurate  i m ugly crying   imwithher pic twitter com   ella dawson   brosandprose  september    blog post that caught hillary s attention discusses dawson s very real and terrible problems with the alt right  her broader discussion  though  is about how rape threats  death threats  doxxing  shaming  and more  happen to women all over the internet because we dare to internet while female  the sheer gall of us to have an opinion and put it out there   we should  in the eyes of the misogynistic alt right  stay silent  we bring the harassment on ourselves in their view what s worse is that some of the people harassing dawson aren t the typical cretins that inhabit the alt right  mike cernovich  who s a lawyer  but more well known for his sexist internet presence  tweeted  ugly and has herpes  maybe an sjw male might actually be able to get at these table scraps   doubtful   paul joseph watson  an editor at large at alex jones  infowars  recorded a five minute youtube video talking about how vile were the women who were tweeting under the hashtag  shoutyourstatus for std awareness month  he ended it with the typical sexist attack of  i don t think we should be that surprised that feminists are bragging about their stds  after all  they re so fat and ugly  the mere fact that they re having any kind of sex at all is a massive achievement  because the women the alt right considers to be their eye candy all know their places and would never be so hateful towards men as to become a feminist  sure the response to that video caused dawson to lock her twitter account  lest breitbart writers  and other misogynistic writers  embed her tweets in their stories  causing an ever growing cycle of harassment  a man writing about this stuff would never receive this treatment  ever that s what hillary knows  and has dealt with as a strong woman in a position of power for most of her life  hillary stood up in reno and read off breitbart headlines while many other women are afraid to even mention that cesspool of a news site  dawson has been a hillary supporter for years  but her admiration for hillary went through the roof when she witnessed this speech dawson ended her post with a thank you to hillary for having the guts  yes  it takes guts to stand up to the hate of the alt right  to call the alt right out for what it is  misogyny  racism  white nationalism  white supremacy  anti semitism  and all around hate are what the alt right is about  that s despite the fact that  according to dawson  they delusionally bill themselves as   trendy new generation of conservatism  pushing boundaries and buttons in response to political correctness and liberal oversensitivity  please  that is vile on its face bravo to dawson for continuing to internet while female  and bravo to hillary for standing with her  that is what makes a president featured image by justin sullivan getty images
