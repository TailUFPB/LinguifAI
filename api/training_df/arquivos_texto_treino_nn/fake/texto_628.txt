by now you ve seen donald trump s absolute monday meltdown on twitter  a ten hour tweeting frenzy that beat every other tirade he s ever had on the social media platform  trump was cooped up indoors because he really wanted to golf  while still claiming it wasn t a vacation  so he was forced to stay at his new jersey golf club   and he was rained off the course but scrambled in with the rest of his nonsense were four tweets about senator richard blumenthal of connecticut  four out of thirteen total  that means at least a third of the orange babyman s fury was directed at one guy  what could have gotten trump mad enough for this interesting to watch senator richard blumenthal of connecticut talking about hoax russian collusion when he was a phony vietnam con artist   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    in u s history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like senator richard blumenthal  he told stories about his vietnam battles and    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    conquests  how brave he was  and it was all a lie  he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child  now he judges collusion   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    think senator blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in vietnam  where he lied about his service  so he can at least say he was there  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    did you notice the time gap there  eight and a half hours passed after the initial spate of blumenthal tweets  and trump was still fuming about him it turns out trump has more to be upset with blumenthal over than his supposed lies about vietnam  and it wasn t just his appearance earlier in the day on cnn s new day  where he discussed the ongoing investigation into trump s collusion with russia according to a jeffrey toobin article in the new yorker from june   senator blumenthal is the democrat most likely to succeed in having his case against trump heard regarding violations of the  emoluments clause  of the constitution  from the article other lawsuits against trump  on emoluments grounds  have been filed  including one by the governments of maryland and the district of columbia  none have yet been decided   but blumenthal believes that his suit will be the one that survives a challenge on standing grounds   the clause specifically says that the president needs the consent of congress to receive this money from foreign countries  so he s deprived us of the chance to give our consent   blumenthal said   i think that s enough for us to get into court  notably  if judge emmet sullivan  of the federal district court in washington  allows the case to proceed  the plaintiffs may be allowed to obtain trump s elusive tax returns as part of the discovery process so there s that  looks like mr  phonypants mcdraftdodger was doing a little projecting about vietnam because he was afraid of the war blumenthal is bringing down on him  right here at home blumenthal had the last laugh mr  president  your bullying hasn t worked before and it won t work now  no one is above the law   richard blumenthal   senblumenthal  august    image via alex wong getty images
