an interview with cnn anchor anderson cooper and sebastian gorka wednesday night went off the rails when the white house deputy assistant started lecturing the host on  fake news   it s remarkable really because gorka is  fake   even his phd is fake and yet  he used to insist that everyone call him  doctor   still yet  the fake doctor couldn t help himself and launched into a rant against  fake news  it s laughable  your chryon talked about a  crisis   gorka told cooper in response to a suggestion that the white house was in turmoil   i actually work in the west wing  i work in the white house  it is absolutely nothing of the kind  the president is a steam locomotive that can t be stopped  it s just fake news  i m sad to see cnn fall to this   gorka said   i know you want salacious and sensational coverage for your ratings so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money  but that s not media  that s not reportage  it s just fake news  okay  i m just going to ignore the insults because i don t think it really gets us anywhere   cooper shot back cooper pressed gorka over a tweet which trump posted on twitter saying the media often makes up its sources  despite the fact that trump jr  released the email chain which confirms the new york times  reporting remember  when you hear the words  sources say  from the fake media  often times those sources are made up and do not exist   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    i m giving you an opportunity right now to correct what the president said this morning  because what he s alleging is that the reporting is fake and in fact  his son s own email chain shows that it s accurate  do you deny that   cooper asked  no  i deny the fact that there is anything here that is untoward  again this is an obsessive nine month campaign   gorka said an exhausted gorka eventually said   i thought we were going to talk about real issues  like what we re doing with our allies in france  defeating isis  i am going to ask you but you re not being honest  you re not being upfront   cooper responded  how many minutes are we in   gorka said  are you a tv producer now   cooper fired back   you re concerned about how many minutes we ve been talking  do you have somewhere else to go  if you gotta go  you gotta go  you re falling into the fake news trap again   said gorka   and it s sad  anderson  you re shaking shiny objects to try to divert people  but i don t think viewers are really that easily diverted   cooper said  do you know why the president s description of a witch hunt is accurate   gorka asked   because there never were witches  and there never was any collusion  it s bogus   anderson  you re like a broken record  no  because i m not getting any answers from you   replied cooper  i m answering it  every time   said gorka  no  you re responding   said cooper   you re not actually answering because you re not actually being up front  let s let the viewers judge   gorka said  who then mocked cnn s ratings  you used that line on monday  and you know  it was sort of mildly amusing   cooper said   but i think it s funny that you have enough time in the white house  which is apparently you re so busy  you re able to sit around  read nielsen numbers  no  i had really good prep from my team  because the white house press team is superb   gorka said   i don t deal with this stuff because i do have a day job  watch a clip from the interview   andersoncooper fires back at  sebgorka   i m just going to ignore the insults   i don t think it gets us anywhere https   t co cbygccwsld  anderson cooper       july    brought up that cnn apologized for an inaccurate story but trump has never corrected his errors  later in his show  cooper described gorka as  the hungarian don rickles  while the trump administration would love for everyone to think that everything is fine  the white house is in crisis image via screen capture
