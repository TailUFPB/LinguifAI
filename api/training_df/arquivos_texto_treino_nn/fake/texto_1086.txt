newt gingrich has been one of donald trump s most vocal cheerleaders  but in a new book  he threw his president under the bus by revealing the real reason trump ran for president  and it s far worse than you think  trump clearly thinks the presidency is a toy that he could buy because it s more fun than buying a yacht  his response was priceless   gingrich writes in  understanding trump   in an excerpt published by abc news on sunday   after a moment of thought  he said      to  million  that would be a yacht  this would be a lot more fun than a yacht    he also noted how trump ran his campaign like a corporation    ahead of schedule and under budget  describing a phone conversation he had with trump after the south carolina primary in february   gingrich said the presidential candidate said he was indeed under budget   at the tail end of our conversation  he jokingly said   by the way  i know you said i needed to spend   million  but i ve only spent   million  i feel kind of bad     gingrich quoted trump  who won the south carolina primary  as having said source  marketwatchthat explains a lot  it explains why trump is woefully unprepared to be president  it also explains why he seems to think the office is his ticket to getting even richer trump doesn t read  he doesn t pay attention to national security briefings unless his name is plastered all over the briefings  preferably with pictures nearly every meeting he s had with a world leader has been a disaster  he s offended all of our allies and he s helped accomplish the russian goal of destabilizing the country  he also has the most corrupt presidency in history while trump might be having fun after spending less than he might have spent on a yacht  it s clear his presidency comes at the expense of the american people and of our reputation as the world s largest superpower  in other words  he s playing a very scary game and he simply doesn t care featured image via pool getty images
