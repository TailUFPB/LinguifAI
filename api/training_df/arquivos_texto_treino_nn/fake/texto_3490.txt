during a debate on french television show niveau z ro  zero level   right wing nationalist daniel conversano spewed so much hate that essayist alain soral couldn t hold back anymore  they re not french   conversano said about arab immigrants  he thinks muslims should be killed and wiped out of the country by any means necessary  even if it means committing war crimes conversano is also anti semitic  which means he wants to treat jews like the nazis treated them soral took issue with conversano s open hostility toward muslims  saying   they re not white  you mean   he replied   by what right do you dare to say that  and then things escalated conversano   because it s the truth and everyone realizes it  soral   who is  everyone   you little sh t  conversano responded by defining  everyone  as the  percent of people who support the national front party in the polls because they have  had it up to their a  holes in arabs  at this point  soral couldn t stand listening to conversano s racist bullshit anymore and proceeded to whoop his ass here s the video via youtube  the fight is at the   mark over  years ago  americans joined nations around the world to fight and defeat regimes that preached racial purity and hate against certain ethnic groups  white nationalists in germany took control of the nation from within via elections and the people paid the price for it  millions of people around the globe paid the price for it with their very lives  democracy and humanity were directly threatened with annihilation because people like daniel conversano in france and donald trump here in america are allowed to peddle their hatred and bigotry as mainstream ideas  they play on people s fears and emotions to turn them against people  and when enough people hand them power  we end up with brutal dictatorships that commit human rights violations and even genocide a right wing movement is currently rising to power across europe like a plague and even america is going to be controlled by white nationalists for the next four years  for some reason  millions of people in europe and america have forgotten about what white nationalists have done in the not so distant past  jews were the ones being persecuted during world war ii  muslims are the ones being persecuted now  and fascism is once again poised to destroy democracy  the only question is who is going to stand up and fight against it if the governments and military forces of the free world are dominated by evil while we may not necessarily agree with what soral did  at least he had the courage to fight a white nationalist in defense of human rights  after all  white nationalists have been committing hate crimes and killing people for decades featured image via screenshot
