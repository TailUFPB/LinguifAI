on wednesday  gop rep  kevin cramer opened his mouth and inserted his foot so deep that the nation s top doctors will still be trying to remove it when he inevitably loses his next election in a landslide  according to cramer  sean spicer was kinda right when he presented some  alternative facts  regarding the holocaust   specifically  his claim that adolf hitler didn t use chemical weapons  not even in concentration camps or  as spicer calls them   holocaust centers  the media is so gullible  they fall for these things because they think it s really hot stuff and the public just can t wait to stick it to sean spicer   who   of the people wouldn t have the foggiest idea who he is and it distracts them from other things   cramer told conservative radio north dakota radio host scott hennen   i can t even believe that anybody in the media  much less all of the major networks  led with this story  a spokesperson  who by the way made a poor illustration  but it s not completely  it s not without some validity  i think he apologized and that s the end of it  cramer said  as though denying the holocaust can be fixed with a fauxpology   i think what he was saying is that hitler didn t take chemical weapons out in a battle like form and do what assad did with these children  it s a factual statement   cramer says what spicer actually said was that adolf hitler didn t use chemical weapons  which makes him better than assad  we didn t use chemical weapons in world war ii  you had a  someone who is as despicable as hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons  he later explained that he acknowledges that hitler took jewish people to  holocaust centers  but that hitler was not using the gas on his own people the same way that assad is doing  how are people responding to this  well  let s just say that the  sean spicer was right that hitler was a good dude compared to assad  strategy isn t working out for him north dakota rep  kevin cramer is a full blown idiot  or a nazi  or both   pinder binder   pinderbinder  april     i don t think anyone can top sean spicer kevin cramer  hold my be  me  no  i m already holding spicer s   united s   pepsi s  https   t co   matt baldwin   mattycantfail  april    cnnpolitics missed germans developed nerve gas and basic world history in high school did you  kevincramer  meg yarbrough   megyarbrough  april    cnn  kevincramer what in the ever loving hell is wrong with you  you do not belong in a position of leadership   tara jepsen   captaindingbat  april     please join me in faxing images of hitler s gas chambers to holocaust denying rep  kevin cramer  https   t co dyuwvihmmz pic twitter com   taylor h  brogan   thbrogan  april    s not very often you get to see someone dig his own grave  but cramer did just that  remember his name  folks in north dakotafeatured image via screengrab
