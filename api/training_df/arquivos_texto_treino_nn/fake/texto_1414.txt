in yet another example of trump s inability to maintain even a slight bit of tact while representing america s interests overseas  the white house reportedly canceled plans to visit a historic landmark during his visit to israel   one of the nation s biggest tourist attractions  the reason  trump wanted to land his helicopter directly on the ancient mountain fortress and was told no president donald trump has canceled a planned visit and speech at the ancient mountain fortress of masada in israel after authorities told him that he could not land his helicopter on top of the unesco listed site instead  trump will now deliver a speech at the israel museum in jerusalem  it comes after an israeli air force  iaf  regulation that prevents helicopters landing at the summit of the masada site  according to israel s channel  broadcaster unlike former presidents who have made the trip  such as george w  bush and bill clinton  trump declined to land the helicopter at a base of the historic site and then take the cable car up  preferring to cancel the visit altogether the reasons not allowing helicopters near the   year old ruins should be obvious  for starters  the dust and sand that characterize the mountaintop are extremely rough on helicopter motors  secondly  the wind and sand kicked up by the powerful blades can destroy the ancient structures  costing archaeologists priceless artifacts  avoiding those issues by simply getting in a cable car was apparently too much energy it may be another sign that trump is hoping to breeze past this trip while doing minimal work  sources close to trump say he is extremely upset about having to travel abroad for a multi day trip to the middle east and already begged his staff to cut the number of days he d be gone  keen observers of trump s habits might note that trump will be missing at least two weekends during the trip  days he typically reserves for golfing at his various private courses trump s demands on his overseas guests have raised eyebrows before  earlier this year  trump created a stir in england when reports leaked that he had requested queen elizabeth pick him up in a golden chariot the white house has made clear it regards the carriage procession down the mall as an essential element of the itinerary for the visit currently planned for the second week of october  according to officials the request frustrated royal planners who described the situation as a logistical and financial nightmare it s unclear how israelis will react to trump s show of laziness during his trip  already the country s mood toward trump is souring after the president is said to have leaked classified information provided by israeli intelligence services to the russians  he hasn t even left the white house and already his trip is shaping up to be trouble featured image via mark wilson getty images
