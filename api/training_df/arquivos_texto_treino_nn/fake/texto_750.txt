donald trump is very busy right now trying to get rid of his attorney general  one jeff sessions  this is pretty extraordinary  since sessions endorsed trump while the rest of the elected republican establishment was still treating trump s candidacy with a mix of comedy and horror  now  however  times have changed  trump wants sessions gone  due his firm  and possibly true  belief that sessions  decision to recuse himself from the russia investigation led to the appointment of special counsel robert mueller as mueller digs further into trump world   including into trump s finances  which trump himself has said is some kind of red line   trump is looking for a way to rid himself of the threat of what mueller might find  with sessions recused  deputy attorney general rod rosenstein is the one who would have the authority to fire robert mueller  rosenstein has gone on the record under oath as saying that he will do no such thing without just cause  the solution to all of this for trump  get rid of sessions and rosenstein  and appoint an attorney general who will be a staunch and unwavering trump loyalist it has been speculated that trump is considering that former new york mayor and fervent trump supporter rudy giuliani might be just the man to do this  however  there is just one problem with that  giuliani likely wouldn t pass the senate confirmation process in this climate  in order to appear non partisan  even senate republicans would insist on a nominee who is not an obvious trump stalwart  plus  rudy giuliani already admitted on the air that he literally tried to help trump find a way to ban muslims from the nation without doing so explicitly so as to pass constitutional muster  then there was the time during the campaign when giuliani seemed to know what would be in a batch of hacked anti hillary clinton emails that were leaked shortly after his statements  so  yeah  big confirmation problems there so  what s trump to do  well  that s easy  go around the senate completely and install any attorney general he wants  by appointing someone during the recess that the senate always takes in late summer  problem solved  according to the washington post  team trump is considering doing just that  when it comes to weighing options to get a pro trump attorney general  from wapo another scenario is that trump could make a recess appointment  said university of texas school of law professor steve vladeck  under that plan  trump could choose an attorney general during the august recess who would serve until the end of the next senate session  which could be early january  that person would have the same authority as someone who is confirmed by the senate  vladeck said now obviously such a move would be nothing short of the height of corruption  and politically explosive for congressional republicans  especially if they don t warn him against doing this  we all know that trump and the people in the white house don t care how something like that looks  they want robert mueller and his russia investigation gone at all costs  and if it means looking guilty as hell to do it  so be it  anyone who has paid attention knows that rudy giuliani would have absolutely no issue following a trump order to fire robert mueller  he d relish the task  in fact  because that would put him in the highest regard in trump world   perhaps permanently republicans  if this shit goes down like this  it s on your heads  it would literally spin us into a full fledged constitutional crisis  if trump moves to fire mueller  you need to impeach him  period featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
