saturday morning  trump was going through his usual routine of drinking six quarts of red bull while wistfully flipping through his ivanka photo albums when a novel idea suddenly occurred to him  he raced to twitter to let his eager followers know exactly what his plans were as the most powerful man in the world subject to the receipt of further information  i will be allowing  as president  the long blocked and classified jfk files to be opened   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    s right  donald trump will finally be opening that presidential book hidden in the library of congress  and found by nicolas cage  that contains all of the secrets passed down from president to president across the ages to reveal what really happened to jfk just kidding  despite the fact that he tried to make it sound like it was his idea  and happening only under his authority  it turns out that the  jfk files   as he so loudly put it  were scheduled to be released no later than next thursday  october     coincidentally  that date is exactly  years to the day after the  president john f  kennedy assassination records collection act of   was passed by the  congress okay  i m kidding again  democratic senator and american hero john glenn introduced the bill in july of that year   likely while production was wrapping up on donald trump s star cameo in the hollywood blockbuster  home alone   lost in new york  especially relevant in the text of the bill is section   which discusses the reasoning behind senator glenn s proposal of it isn t it weird  how trump really emphasized the fact that the  jfk files  were  long blocked and classified  and that he was gonna do something about it  i mean  besides the fact that all he s actually doing is allowing an existing law to  uh  continue to exist and carry out as planned  no  what s weird is who  long blocked and classified  those files  john glenn  who may or may not know the truth about the moon landing  was kind enough not to name the sitting president he was indicting in this bill for obstructing the files  release  but the math is pretty simple  from july to october of   the entire time this bill was debated until its passage  the person referred to as  the executive branch  was former president  and even former er cia chief  george h w  bush a republican  as usual anyway  thanks  trumpykins  we really appreciate you  uh  not stopping this thing that was totally going to happen even if you d been hit by a meteor the day you admitted you were a sexual predator  i wonder how long the presidential records on all the crimes you ve committed since your inauguration will remain sealed featured image via chris kleponis  pool  getty images
