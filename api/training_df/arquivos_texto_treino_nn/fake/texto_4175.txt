donald trump has claimed to be a billionaire who was willing to spend major dollars in order to secure the white house and remain independent  in reality  trump has been stingy with his money and the evidence has mounted that he is worth far less than he claims   and he won t release his tax returns to prove otherwise now in the most recent filings  trump again has been shown up as a liar  donating far less of his own money to the campaign even as hillary clinton began to increase her lead in nearly every national poll donald trump cut his routine   million monthly check to his campaign last september after repeatedly suggesting that he would increase his donations during the campaign s stretch run trump s campaign  along with republican joint fundraising committees  said it raised   million last month  more than it has in any previous month though well short of the   million hillary clinton s operation took in the report also showed that unlike in other years  big pocketed republican donors have not lined up to support the trump campaign  in all likelihood they are seeing the writing on the wall and are staying away from a campaign circling the drain since freaking out over former miss universe alicia machado  the release of his sexual assault audio tape  and the stream of women now coming forward to allege that trump molested them  his polling numbers have collapsed  combined with republican officials rescinding their support  trump is now seen as with only about a  percent chance of winning the election according to most polling analysis at the same time  hillary clinton has consolidated most of the democratic party base behind her  and has top tier surrogates like president obama  michelle obama  joe biden  elizabeth warren and bernie sanders campaigning on her behalf featured image via flickr
