former obama national security adviser  susan rice  voluntarily testified to the senate intelligence committee in a closed door session as part of their ongoing investigation into how russia interfered in the  election  during these investigations  some news has come to light that republicans have tried to use to discredit obama  some of his officials  and thus  the entire russia scandal  it seems  though  that some republicans spread some fake news about all of this  probably to help donald trump the chairman of the house intelligence committee  devin nunes  has maintained that rice improperly unmasked the names of members of trump s transition team caught up in incidental surveillance of russian nationals  however  senator richard burr  a republican and the chairman of the senate intelligence committee  has something to say about that  and it s pretty damning for nunes  the unmasking thing was all created by devin nunes  and i ll wait to go through our full evaluation to see if there was anything improper that happened   so devin nunes lied  it certainly looks like that s what burr is saying  while burr acknowledged that american citizens on trump s transition team were unmasked  and that information did become public when it shouldn t have  he seems to believe that nunes was making things up when he accused susan rice of improper unmasking that goes with earlier reports that nunes got his information from the white house  which has had a bone to pick with the entire obama administration since jan    nunes was vague in discussing the unmasking  apparently because the information was classified  but maybe also because he knew he was lying  most other lawmakers who have seen these records  and have seen the unmasking  said there was no evidence of wrongdoing on rice s part  or anyone else s  but nunes made it his mission to discredit rice  and thus  obama  to the point where he could at least accuse the obama administration of breaking the law the problem with nunes  involvement with this investigation is that he was always more interested in clearing trump than he was in actually investigating the fact that a hostile foreign power successfully meddled in our election in   he s also apparently said that he s been getting updates on the investigation despite recusing himself from it  and that he  can do whatever i want  i m the chairman of the committee  nunes needs to lose his job featured image via mark wilson getty images
