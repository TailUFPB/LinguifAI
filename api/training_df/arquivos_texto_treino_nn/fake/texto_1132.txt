there have been many reactions to the horrific shooting at a republican baseball game this week  but the one that was just given by congressman mark sanford  r sc  is one of the most shocking while many republicans have been quick to blame democrats and liberals for the shooter s actions  sanford went on morning joe today to point the finger at america s president  donald trump  sounding like a republican who might actually have a tiny grip on reality  sanford argued that trump helped create a toxic political environment  which may have motivated yesterday s attack  sanford said  i think we have to watch out as a society because  if we don t watch out  civility is indeed a part of civilized government and an open political system  if you let these forces play out  i think we end up at a very  very bad spot  i think what happened yesterday was symptomatic of it  sanford then turned his focus on trump  stating that he is part of the reason america has become so deeply divided  and his rhetoric has undoubtedly had an effect on the country  sanford didn t mince his words when he said  i would argue that the president is at least in partially   not totally   but partially to blame for demons that have been unleashed  the fact that you have the top guy saying i wish i can hit you in the face  why don t you and i ll pay your legal fees  that s bizarre  we ought to call it as such  what i ve said back home  some of these people have been frankly weird and different in a town hall meeting  i say what is going on  they ll say look  if the guy at the top can say anything to anybody at any time  why can t i  i think we all need to look for ways to learn from what happened yesterday and to say  wait a minute  this is a pause moment  what might i do a little differently in the way i reached out to other members  finally  a republican who has the guts to point out just how insane and inappropriate trump s behavior is  and to acknowledge that there are consequences to having a potus who is this unhinged  you can watch the interview below featured image via joe raedle getty images
