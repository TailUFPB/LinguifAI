on tuesday  donald trump announced the identity of his supreme court nominee  neil gorsuch  at first glance  trump s pick appears to be a typical  hardworking aryan man who pledges to uphold the constitution  unfortunately  he is not the man he pretends to be the denver post notes that gorsuch is best known for siding against reason and sanity in burwell v  hobby lobby stores  on top of that  he feels that anything related to christianity   including attempts to use the religion as a shield while a bigoted corporation denies women full access to their healthcare options   is above  secular courts  it is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious complaint of a faithful adherent  or to decide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes  too much  moral disapproval on those only  indirectly  assisting wrongful conduct   gorsuch wrote in his opinion  ultimately  the then conservative heavy supreme court ruled in favor of corporations  right to deprive people to healthcare options if they slap a bible verse next to their explanation of their decision  gorsuch also sided with a catholic organization in another anti obamacare case  judge gorsuch has a record of ruling in a way that does not reflect colorado values on reproductive rights  this is a pro choice state that supports the constitutional right to abortion enshrined in roe v  wade and the right to privacy enshrined in griswold v  connecticut   beliefs that are contradicted in judge gorsuch s ruling in hobby lobby and little sisters   karen middleton  executive director of naral pro choice colorado  said following trump s announcement  colorado has a long  bipartisan history of supporting reproductive rights  judge gorsuch does not reflect the will of our state or the constitutional rights of american women and we would oppose his nomination  it s not just colorado whose values gorsuch doesn t reflect  a full  percent of americans say that birth control is morally acceptable  compared to  percent who say the same about divorce and  percent who are in favor of cloning human  he and trump may be in the minority  but nevertheless gorsuch has taken his first step toward a lifetime position where he can continue to push his poisonous views and agenda it might seem like an attractive idea to hope that gorsuch will do his job well  but we cannot gamble with a lifetime position  it is up to us as americans to demand that our elected officials say  no  to this man  who clearly is unable to think rationally wherever  moral  issues are concerned featured image via getty images alex wong
