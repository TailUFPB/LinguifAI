the  deal maker  just got owned donald trump embarrassed himself and america again during a recent phone call with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull as we all know  president obama struck a deal with australia in  agreeing to take   refugees from nauru and papua new guinea s manus island but trump doesn t want to honor the deal  so he whined about it  i hate taking these people   trump said   i guarantee you they are bad  that is why they are in prison right now  they are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people  the refugees are in a detention camp right now because they have been denied entry into australia  they are not necessarily  bad  people trump s  milk people  remark is a reference to the american dairy industry it s a racist remark  of course  because not all immigrants perform farm work  some become doctors and businessmen  some become teachers and police officers  some even go into politics the fact is that united states can also hold these refugees until a thorough vetting process is complete before allowing them to resettle  therefore  trump s concern that these refugees are  bad  is ridiculous anyway  turnbull  who is also a businessman  told trump to suck it up and honor the terms of the agreement  there is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal   turnbull reminded trump   you can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done  but you are going to stick with it  in other words  the man who allegedly wrote  the art of the deal  just got schooled on deal making by australia s prime minister turnbull is right  a deal is a deal and trump must comply with it or risk angering and alienating one of our closest allies trump cannot just go back and examine every deal made in american history and go back on it if he doesn t agree with it  that s not how governing works  sitting presidents must honor the agreements made by their predecessors  anything else violates trust between nations and hurts our reputation around the globe he can try to renegotiate a deal if he wishes and some deals can even be voided by congress  but the deal with australia will be hard to renegotiate because turnbull expects america to honor it and we should  it s the right thing to do featured image  mark wilson getty images
