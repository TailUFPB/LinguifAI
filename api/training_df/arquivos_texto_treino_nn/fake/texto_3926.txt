the right wing is still harping on the fbi s discovery of new emails that supposedly relate to the probe into hillary clinton  as expected  trump has seized on this news as an opportunity to continue trying to smear her all over the pavement  this time  though  his statements about her emails go totally off into the ether  can you imagine anthony weiner has probably every classified email ever sent  probably studied every single one in between using his machine for other purposes including some brand new emails not previously turned over to authorities  likely including some very  very classified information  because he totally knows what s going on better than anyone else  but he s probably getting desperate   realclearpolitics has hillary ahead in most major polls despite this latest piece of a non scandal that republicans keep trying to use to crush her it s still not yet clear what the fbi is seeing in these emails  so trump s conclusions are even more questionable  however  of the   emails found  it s likely that only a small number might be relevant to the original investigation  also  investigators would still have to find evidence that she knowingly broke the law  because comey previously decided not to charge her earlier  trump claimed that these emails were worse than watergate  and one of the prosecutors for watergate promptly destroyed him for that   there is no evidence of any violation of law   he said   for trump to reach that conclusion based on a total lack of evidence is reminiscent of the innuendo spread by joseph mccarthy in the early   for trump to continue firing up his loyal subjects by claiming that anthony weiner must have closely studied all these emails is just as bad  because he s still not presenting evidence  just ridiculous suspicions  he hears the word  emails  in association with hillary  and he jumps on it like a fly to feces because that s all he knows how to do his supporters chanted   lock her up   as they usually do  while the fbi remains busy tearing itself apart over this  trump will say anything to get elected  no matter how far fetched  ridiculous  and just plain stupid it is featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
