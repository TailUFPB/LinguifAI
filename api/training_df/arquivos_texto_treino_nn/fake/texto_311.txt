conservatives cheered when pittsburgh steeler alejandro villanueva  who s also a combat veteran  came out and stood for the national anthem while the rest of the team stayed in the locker room  they won t be happy with what villanueva has said about it since  though  they think he s just like them  a jingoist among a sport full of traitors to america  and this is really going to ruin that first off  it doesn t look like villanueva intended to be defiant this way villenueva asked ben after sat night meeting if he could be out in front with captains  agreed to   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    turned around when the bears fan flag came in  he looked back to his teammates then the anthem started  he couldn t walk out then  chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    it looks like there might have been some miscommunication about what they were doing  or maybe that villanueva wasn t totally sure what the team had agreed to do he also said he knew  every time he saw the flag on a fellow soldier s shoulder during a mission  that they were fighting for each other  he also did say   people die for the flag  there s no way else to put it  there s nothing else that would justify dying for that mission    it s likely the mission he meant was whatever mission he and his fellow soldiers were on  rather than the mission of fighting for the flag that trump fans are glomming onto  but it s what he says about how he feels about what happened that will have trump fans seething  seriously alejandro villanueva   this national anthem ordeal has sort of been out of control  and there s a lot of blame on myself  chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september     i made coach tomlin look bad  and that is my fault and my fault only  i made my teammates look bad  and that is my fault only  chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    villanueva   unfortunately  i threw  my teammates  under the bus  unintentionally   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    villaneuva   every single time i see that picture of me standing by myself  i feel embarrassed   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    villanueva   for anybody who thinks that coach tomlin is not as patriotic as you can get in america  i m offended by that   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september      we as a team tried to figure it out  obviously we butchered it   i m not gonna pretend i have some kind of righteous voice   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    villaneuva   i will support all my teammates  and all my teammates and all my coaches have always supported me   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    then there s this villenueva says he  absolutely  would be ok if teammates kneeled or sat during the anthem   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    villanueva says some players who have been kneeling during anthems have approached him after before games and thanked him for his service  chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    villenueva   every single one of my teammates is extremely supportive and extremely patriotic  i can honestly said that   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    villaneuva   the team meeting that we had on saturday night brought the whole team together  absolutely  we had great conversations   chris adamski   cadamskitrib  september    fans really don t understand why people are so angry at them for whining about professional athletes not standing for the national anthem  the jingoism is dangerously strong among them  along with the cluelessness and blind followership  in fact  many of them are on the above thread and totally  utterly and completely misunderstanding it  they aren t the patriots they believe themselves to be  not even close featured image via joe robbins getty images
