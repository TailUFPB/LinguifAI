earlier today  trump said to a crowd at macdill air force base that the  very dishonest media  wasn t reporting on the terror attacks that are happening all across europe all the time  later on  the media pressed sean spicer on that topic while aboard air force one  and spicer s response was to say that they d provide a list  later on   well  that list is out  and surprise surprise  it s completely ridiculous since trump s comments focused on europe and  by extension  the u s   the following lists are focused there  despite many  many other attacks happening around the world perhaps one of the most ridiculous things about the white house s list of attacks is that it includes high profile attacks that were covered for days on end  such as the  attack against charlie hebdo in paris  and the fateful attack at a paris club in november  it also includes two foiled attacks that were also widely reported  broken down they also list several attacks in france in  that were covered extensively then they list an attack in london in december  that was covered by cnn  reuters  the huffington post  usa today  and more there s one in copenhagen  denmark in february of  that was covered by cnn  the new york times  usa today  the huffington post  reuters  and more most of us probably remember the march  attack in brussels  belgium  which was covered by cnn  npr  the new york times  cbs news  nbc news  usa today  abc news  and more but that s europe  what about the attacks they list here in the u s  that supposedly weren t covered  or weren t covered extensively enough  like the following really  so far we ve looked closely at  of the attacks listed  and they were all widely covered by u s  media  trump and his minions insist that we re not covering attacks in europe hardly at all  and then they provide a list with  attacks that are in the middle east  parts of asia  and in indonesia and the philippines those attacks are terrible and tragic  too  but again  trump didn t say anything about us not covering attacks in those regions  he probably didn t even think about those regions until whoever it was that compiled that list gave it to him  if they gave it to him  but the biggest falsehood is that the media isn t reporting  or is underreporting  on these attacks  it s like they hurriedly compiled a list of terror attacks worldwide from wikipedia and couldn t be bothered to proofread  let alone research  there are spelling errors in addition to the lie that the media covers up attacks  our dishonest  president   has a lot of nerve accusing the media of actively covering up terrorist attacks the full list  as provided to cnn  is below  feel free to google whatever you want here s the list the white house sent of attacks they feel  did not receive adequate attention from western media sources   pic twitter com   kevin liptak   kevinliptakcnn  february    more featured image by alex wong via getty images
