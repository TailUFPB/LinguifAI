former fbi director james comey is  no doubt  just trying to get on with his life right now after being unceremoniously stripped of his job by an administration prone to temper tantrums worthy of three year old children  press and others are apparently camped outside comey s virginia home  and one of his very young neighbors thinks that just isn t right  so she decided to see if she could brighten his day with a little gift   fresh baked chocolate chip cookies so how is this little girl  named abby  more mature than an old man named donald trump  well  besides the obvious problems with trump and his hypersensitive response to everything  it s the reason why she delivered cookies to comey  her mother told a reporter that abby said  we ve spent a lot of time talking about how kindness and empathy are the most important ways for us to engage  people regardless of if we agree with or understand their positions in  comey s case  abby said  i wanted him to know we respect him for his career of service  that s not all  though  abby actually sent a note with the cookies that said  we are proud to be your neighbor and thank you for all you have done for america  love  abby grace  reports from the white house saying comey had lost the respect of his rank and file agents seem to be inaccurate and designed to prop up trump s decision  made in the heat of a tantrum where trump was just fed up with having someone in his service who wouldn t fall meekly in line behind him  in other words  trump and his minions basically lied in order to make that tantrum look like a legit dismissal  rather than trump stomping his feet and screaming   wah wah wah   comey won t play by my rules  he s being a big meanie head  trump demonstrated his schoolyard bully mentality when he threatened comey over twitter james comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    wasn t having any of it  her mother told reporters this  too  fbi director comey lives in our neighborhood  and  as you would imagine   there were a lot of reporters at the foot of his driveway today  abby thought that was quite inhospitable  lots of reporters haunting your driveway can make you want to stay inside all the time just to avoid answering the same questions over and over and being generally hounded  in comey s case  those questions probably involve things he can t actually discuss  abby must have felt that comey needed a pick me up  well   either a  year old in a parochial school uniform dress doesn t look very threatening  or the smell of the choc chip cookies was so good that the security detail could smell them from the other side of the gate    in either case  abby grace just hand delivered a dozen cookies fresh from the oven  she walked up  shook the hand of the    agent  introduced herself  and  hopefully made director comey s day a little bit better  we hope so  too  to be clear  abby didn t do this to shame trump  she did it because she hoped it would make her neighbor feel better  that s what makes it so awesome  and why it puts trump to a high level of shame featured image by molly riley pool via getty images
