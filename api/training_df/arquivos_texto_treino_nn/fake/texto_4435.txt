it s not clear whether donald trump s campaign manager kellyanne conway thought she could go on the view and think she could get away with lying  but that definitely seemed to be what happened thursday morning while trump still hasn t had the courage to appear on the morning talk show himself  conway took the plunge and surrounded herself with five very opinionated ladies who haven t ever been known to hold back conway tried to sell the same tired lines she s been selling to cable news outlets all over the place  but the ladies weren t having it  not  one  bit at one point  whoopi goldberg asked point blank  where are his damn tax returns   and when conway tried to pathetically pivot  goldberg didn t let up  saying  what is donald trump hiding by not releasing that information   i want to know since every other president has had to do it  where are the tax returns  then after more lies about trump being audited  etc  goldberg bluntly interrupts the poppycock and says  it s bull  and it is this went on for a little longer  but conway was left utterly steamrolled by the end of the interview  and deservedly so  she s representing one of the most unqualified and smarmy scam artists this country has ever seen and has no right to even think about becoming president  yet  somehow  there he is  the smug orange ass and his band of merry morons watch it all unfold here featured image via video screen capture
