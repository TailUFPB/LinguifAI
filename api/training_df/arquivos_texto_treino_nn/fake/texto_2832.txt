newt gingrich  the former speaker of the house who resigned in shame and turned into trump s biggest cheerleader  has a new litmus test to determine if a federal worker keeps their job  did they vote for donald trump or hillary clinton while discussing the trump administration s budget   in which    trillion will be cut fro  various government programs   gingrich told the heritage foundation that in order to balance the relationship between trump and the bureaucracy  federal workers who voted for or supported clinton would be fired  all those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted for clinton  there won t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them  the budget  which is modeled after the heritage foundation s  is seeking to nearly cut all discretionary spending to every federal bureaucracy  which includes federal agency budget cuts by  percent and employee cuts by  percent  coincidentally   percent of the federal workforce is black  and almost  percent of blacks voted for clinton but  again  i m sure it s just a coincidence the dog whistle is becoming louder and louder  the fact that this revelation isn t making widespread headlines is a failure of mainstream journalism  a former powerful politician with close ties to the current administration is advocating for the firing of people with different political affiliations this is a political witch hunt that mirrors the dark days of mccarthyism  because someone doesn t subscribe to the racist  sexist  xenophobic and authoritarian regime that is the trump presidency they risk losing their job doing low level  non political jobs whatever happened to the republican mantra that people be judged based on their ethics and results  in trump s america  it s all about blind patriotism and racism blind ideology  suppression of facts and science  and now vendettas  the gop has become a vehicle for a fascist authoritarian regime  and trump is leading the movement remember when the gop was outraged that the irs was  targeting  conservative groups for their political affiliations  why aren t democrats more outraged over this rank hypocrisy the resistance starts with resisting everyone in trump s camp  not just trump himself featured image via flickr
