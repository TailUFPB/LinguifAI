donald trump s number one fan still believes in him but her support is beginning to waver ann coulter really thought trump was the right candidate to take over the presidency  after all  he said mean things about muslims and mexicans and threatened to blow up the entire government  but despite the fact that trump has already caused significant damage and issued executive orders targeting muslims and latinos  coulter is apparently moving closer toward saying that trump s opponents were right  i m not very happy with what has happened so far   coulter told the daily caller   i guess we have to try to push him to keep his promises  but this isn t north korea  and if he doesn t keep his promises i m out  this is why we voted for him  i think everyone who voted for him knew his personality was grotesque  it was the issues  indeed  even what trump said about grabbing women by their genitals without their consent was not enough to turn coulter against him  all the sexual assault allegations  the business fraud  and the complete lack of knowledge about how government and the world works did not sway coulter at all  she voted for trump and sang his praises by writing books in support of him even the evidence that trump is not even close to being the deal maker he bragged to be was not enough  yet  coulter is now whining about how terrible trump is at negotiating as if she wasn t previously warned  where is the great negotiation   she asked   where is the bull in the china shop we wanted  that budget the republicans pushed through was like a practical joke  did we win anything  and this is the great negotiator  coulter then conceded that  things don t look good  and compared trump s presidency to a road trip gone wrong it s not like i m out yet  but boy  things don t look good  i ve said to other people   it s as if we re in chicago and trump tells us he s going to get us to la in six days  but for the first three days we are driving towards new york  yes  it is true he can still turn around and get us to la in three days  but i m a little nervous coulter even admits that at least one thing trump has done is fascist i have from the beginning been opposed to trump hiring any of his relatives  americans don t like that  i don t like that  that s the one fascist thing he s done  hiring his kids yeah  never mind the deportation force that is literally rounding up latinos like the nazis did to the jews  never mind the fact trump has signed executive orders targeting people just because of their religious beliefs  never mind the fact that trump is aligned with the interests of corporations  never mind that he treats women like shit  never mind that he has repeatedly attacked the free press and uses fox news as his personal propaganda machine  coulter thinks trump has just done one fascist thing by giving his daughter an office in the white house  somebody needs to give coulter a refresher course on what fascism is trump s poll numbers continue to drop and his policies are set to destroy millions of lives and put the world on course for world war iii but coulter still isn t ready to turn against him just yet despite using words like  nightmare  and  disaster  to describe trump s tenure thus far i ll say we had no choice  but the trump haters were right it s a nightmare  i can t even contemplate that  right now i m still rooting for him to turn around and take us toward la it s just that it has been such a disaster so far but coulter did have a choice  the republican field of candidates in  was bigger than it ever has been  she literally had over a dozen choices  but she chose a whining loudmouth ignoramus over candidates like jeb bush or john kasich  who would have been far better and saner than trump  she just wants to watch the world burn and she is disappointed that trump hasn t destroyed it fast enough featured image via flickr
