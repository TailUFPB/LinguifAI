how much more depraved does a so called pastor have to get before people acknowledge that he is not a real christian because one would think that conservative  christians  of all people would be absolutely opposed to donald trump after his lewd comments about groping women came to light on friday but evangelical leaders are willing to abandon their own supposed values and continue supporting trump as long as it means hillary clinton does not become president family research council head tony perkins made that clear on saturday when he still voiced support for trump despite his  grab them by the p ssy  remark  my personal support for donald trump has never been based upon shared values  it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as  justices on the supreme court that ignore the constitution  america s continued vulnerability to islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last    years   perkins said ralph reed of faith and freedom coalition basically said the same thing  voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life  defend religious freedom  create jobs  and oppose the iran nuclear deal  ten year old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns  in other words  trump could sexually assault all the women he wants and still be supported by conservative  christian  leaders and that includes  club preacher pat robertson  who called trump s behavior  macho  while continuing to endorse him for president  a guy does something  years ago  it was a conversation in hollywood where he s trying to look like he s macho   robertson said on monday   and  years after that they surface it from the washington post or whatever  bring it out within  days or so of the election and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off   okay  he s dead  now you ve got to get out of the way and let mike pence run the campaign  robertson proceeded to declare trump the winner of sunday night s debate and called him  a phoenix  rising from the ashes of an imploded campaign here s the video via youtube these hypocrites have been whining for years about how america needs a president who shares their so called biblical values  but now they couldn t care less about those values as long as they can put a puppet in the white house who will rubber stamp their extreme religious agenda and force it upon the nation  even if the candidate they want is totally unfit for the office  these people are not christians  they merely used religion to gain power and wealth and if conservatives actually had spines they would toss these pretenders out on their asses for disgracing the church featured image  screenshot
