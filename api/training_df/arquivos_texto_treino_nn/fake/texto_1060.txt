we all remember how on the eve of montana s special election  then republican candidate greg gianforte made headlines when the guardian s ben jacobs asked him a simple question about the congressional budget office s score on the disastrous gop healthcare bill  instead of answering like any normal person  or even just saying he didn t have a comment at that time  gianforte suddenly became enraged without cause  and body slammed jacobs  breaking his glasses and injuring his arm  gianforte was later charged with misdemeanor assault  despite this disturbing set of events  he still won his race now  gianforte has just been sworn into congress  the montana democrats had a surprise waiting for him on his first day   a bit of trolling if you will  they sent gianforte an orange jumpsuit   clearly suggesting that he should be in jail for what he did to ben jacobs  and not heading to washington to fill a seat in congress  this was the official montana democratic party  too   not just some liberal activists with a sense of humor  they posted to their official website  everyone knows you need plenty of suits to work on capitol hill  while millionaire gianforte can certainly afford his own  we know he has a lot of legal fees to pay  so  we thought we d help him out and get him started by mailing a new suit to his office in the longworth house office building in washington  an orange jumpsuit  that is  roy loewenstein  the spokesman for the montana democrats  went on to say of gianforte  greg gianforte was previously most well known for losing the governor s race in a wave year  now he s most well known for pleading guilty to the  big sky body slam  as a convicted criminal  he will be hidden by his leadership and not given any position of influence in washington  so  we got mr  gianforte a welcome gift to help his new colleagues identify him  of course  the gop was not happy with the bit of fun the montana democrats had at gianforte s expense  the national republican congressional committee was livid at the way the democrats humiliated gianforte  saying through their mouthpiece jack pandol  the swearing in ceremony held today is about all montanans regaining their voice in the house of representatives  not partisan politics  instead  montana democrats are crying over spilled milk simply because they lost an election  this isn t about losing an election  this is about the fact that we have a clearly violent man who is convicted of assault sitting in the united states house of representatives  and the republican party has absolutely no problem with that  then again  they ve always opened their arms to violent criminals  so nobody who has watched their non responses to right wing violence and the horrific scenes at trump rallies is at all surprised  gianforte will be right at home in paul ryan s gop house conference featured image via justin sullivan getty images
