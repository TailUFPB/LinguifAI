there needs to be an independent commission and special prosecutor put on this case now earlier this month  the new york times reported that trump campaign officials were in contact with russian intelligence during the election  intelligence officials intercepted several communications between trump s associates and russian intelligence even as trump was busy publicly urging russian hackers to find hillary clinton s emails infuriated by the report  trump s chief of staff reince priebus got caught trying to get the fbi to shut it down  now white house mouthpiece sean spicer just got caught enlisting the cia director and top republicans on the house and senate intelligence committees to bury the reports according to axios   spicer personally picked up the phone and connected outside officials with reporters to try to discredit a new york times article about trump campaign aides  contact with russia  then remained on the line for the brief conversations  the officials reached by spicer were cia director mike pompeo and senate select intelligence committee chair richard burr  r n c   according to a senior administration official  the reporters were from the washington post and the wall street journal  the official said  spicer provided reporters  phone numbers to house intelligence committee chair devin nunes  r calif    who offered to make the calls himself  according to the official   he was in and out of an event  pompeo and burr told the journalists that the times story wasn t true but provided no details  frustrating the competing reporters  according to the official   both of them said  all i can tell you is the story is not accurate  this looks like a direct effort by trump s white house to kill a report he doesn t like  which begs the question  why is trump so desperate to kill the reports about his ties to russia trump s repeated attempts to do so smacks of a cover up and he is using his partisan cia director and top republicans to do it  the very republicans who lead the committees that would be responsible for investigating trump and his russia ties now it s clear that republicans in congress can t be trusted to run such an investigation  and former cia and pentagon official george little agrees  it s doubtful that congress can conduct an objective and independent investigation into ties between this white house and the russian government if it is collaborating so closely on media pushback with the white house press secretary   he said and that means an independent commission needs to be tasked with investigating trump s ties to russia and a special prosecutor should be appointed to oversee it because it is clear that trump and his team are trying to hide something  there is something they don t want the american people discovering  we deserve to know the truth and by trying so hard to kill it  trump is making this story even bigger and more important than ever featured image  win mcnamee getty images
