john mccain is far more qualified to comment on the nfl anthem protests than donald trump after all  mccain spent over five years as a prisoner of war suffering brutal torture at the hands of his vietnamese captors he is a decorated military veteran who served his country and risked his life trump  on the other hand  dodged the vietnam war draft several times  clearly too much of a coward to fight for america  thousands of others died far away from home while trump spent his daddy s money and slept around so when it comes to choosing who we should listen to when it comes to talking about the nfl anthem protests  john mccain is the most credible on friday  trump called nfl players who kneel during the anthem to protest racial injustice  sons of bitches  and called for them to be fired over the course of the weekend that followed and into this past tuesday  trump repeatedly attacked nfl players on twitter if nfl fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag   country  you will see change take place fast  fire or suspend   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    nfl attendance and ratings are way down  boring games yes  but many stay away because they love our country  league should back u s   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country  nfl should change policy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race  it is about respect for our country  flag and national anthem  nfl must respect this   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    nfl has all sorts of rules and regulations  the only way out for them is to set a rule that you can t kneel during our national anthem   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    ratings for the nfl remained extremely high  and players responded to trump by kneeling en masse  something that had not happened prior to trump attacking them and ordering them to stand it should be pointed out that the government cannot force anyone to stand for the national anthem  just like the government can t force kids to say the pledge of allegiance  hell  even flag burning is protected free speech  therefore  so is kneeling also  players are not kneeling to disrespect the flag  they are doing so to protest racial injustice and in one short sentence  john mccain obliterated trump s whining  that s their right to do what they want as citizens   mccain told tmz when asked about the protest here s the video via youtube let s keep in mind that donald trump himself has repeatedly disrespecting military veterans  during the campaign  he said that mccain is not a war hero because he got captured  trump also insulted a gold star family whose son was killed while courageously saving the lives of his fellow soldiers silently kneeling during the national anthem is not disrespectful at all  these nfl players are shedding light on injustice in this country  an injustice that goes against everything the american flag is supposed to stand for  this protest is not about the troops or the flag as trump claims  it s about injustice and the right to protest against it featured image  steve pope getty images
