well  that didn t take long after weeks of supporting republican candidate ed gillespie on twitter  donald trump quickly distanced himself from him as if he never supported him at all the statewide elections in new jersey and virginia were landslide victories for democrats this year  with gillespie losing the virginia gubernatorial race to ralph northam  who ran on an anti trump platform the losses were a humiliating defeat for trump  who desperately attacked northam on twitter and praised gillespie on election day ralph northam will allow crime to be rampant in virginia  he s weak on crime  weak on our great vets  anti second amendment    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november     and has been horrible on virginia economy  vote  edwgillespie today   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november     edwgillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of va  ms  and crime will be gone  vote today  asap   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november     trump threw gillespie under the bus after hearing about the defeat ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for  don t forget  republicans won  out of  house seats  and with the economy doing record numbers  we will continue to win  even bigger than before   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    you can bet that if gillespie had won trump would kissing his ass right now and calling him a close friend and loyal supporter  but he lost so trump is trashing him and pretending that he never really supported him trump also lied because not only did gillespie embrace trump and his bigotry  the economy is only hitting record numbers thanks to the policies of president obama  had obama served a ninth year in office  we would be seeing these same economic numbers  because trump is still operating on the obama budget and has not signed a single piece of economic legislation if this election is a sign of things to come  trump and the republican party should be scared to death  the american people are coming for them and it s not going to be pretty featured image  alex wong getty images
