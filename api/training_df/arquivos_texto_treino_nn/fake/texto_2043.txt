if today s fiasco  which came courtesy of house intel chair devin nunes  wasn t enough to convince anyone that he can t conduct a credible investigation into whether or not trump and his teams colluded with russia  then this should be  nunes has put almost his entire net worth into a winery with strong ties to russia how strong  well  the alpha omega winery has distributors all over the u s   but just a few abroad  one of those overseas distributors is the luding trading company in russia  luding is  in fact  russia s largest distributor for alcoholic beverages  but they don t just operate in russia   they also appear to have a relationship with vladimir putin  the luding company and the yerevan ararat brandy wine vodka factory sent greetings to vladimir putin  the president of russia  on his  birthday and made a birthday present of bottles of the noy  the sovereign  cognac and the vanatur and varpet unique  vintage wines   being the president s birth year  if russia were truly a free  democratic state  then maybe this could be overlooked as nothing more than a large company wishing the leader of a country that had given them so much a happy birthday  but russia  under putin  is anything but truly free  with luding being the country s largest distributor of alcohol  it s highly unlikely that putin doesn t have his fingers in it somewhere  the fact that nunes has his money sunk there is a pretty big deal it s also odd that alpha omega winery would have a relationship with russia s largest distributor when they only have a relationship with one western nation  switzerland   they don t have any relationships with any other distributor in the eu  which means no relationships with nato allies at all then there s the fact that nunes is one of the people trump called upon to refute news about the whole russia scandal  that right there compromised the house s investigation into trump and russia because it blurs the lines between the intelligence community  the white house  and congress and nunes actually did what trump asked him to   he started sending messages to reporters challenging the russia stories  as the chairman of the committee investigating the trump russia tie  he should never have done that it appears more and more likely that nunes was never acting independently in this investigation  and given that he s got business ties to russia tenuous or not he should have recused himself from this investigation the instant it got underway featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
