there s a lot of buzz about the gop s latest effort to repeal and replace obamacare  as the gop plans to vote on the graham cassidy health care bill  their previous failures are coming back to haunt them  as many people are wondering why the republican party even continues to try to push a health care agenda that has repeatedly failed and isn t even wanted by the majority of americans the gop s fight to repeal obamacare has never looked as pathetic as it did today when republican sen  joni ernst admitted that this bill is as good as dead during a town hall in iowa  in speaking about the graham cassidy bill  ernst said to much applause  i ll be honest  it seems unlikely that we ll be voting on this   seriously  this is a major blow to the gop  not only are republican senators publicly expressing doubt over this health care bill  but some top republicans   like arizona senator john mccain   are actively going to vote against it as it stands  most of america   republicans included   want bipartisan fixes to the affordable care act  the majority of the country overwhelmingly is in favor of keeping obamacare  but the gop continues to ignore what the people want  instead  they are hellbent on stripping millions of healthcare and hiking up premiums the insane thing is that even if graham cassidy fails  which it likely will   the gop will probably just continue to draft more health care bills  they seem to learn nothing from their failures and see nothing wrong with wasting time and energy that could be used for something far more promising  under trump s  leadership   the republican party has never been so ineffective   obviously taking after their leader s example  no one believes in the gop s ability to improve health care   not even its own senators featured image is a screenshot
