even fox news understands that the republican healthcare bill will leave millions of americans in financial ruins that s why chris wallace put the screws to house speaker paul ryan on sunday so far  the gop healthcare bill has been universally panned and republicans who still support the bill are struggling to defend it the bill will not only strip health insurance from tens of millions of americans  it will make the cost of healthcare skyrocket  especially among senior citizens whose costs are projected to be ten times what they pay now under the affordable care act during an interview on fox news sunday  wallace pointed out to ryan that the gop healthcare bill would force senior citizens with an annual income of    to spend    a year on health insurance instead of the    they currently spend thanks to subsidies provided by the affordable care act wallace then slammed ryan for saying that the gop plan is  what freedom looks like   even though seniors would be forced to spend over half of their income on healthcare  that s definitely not freedom  you said that part of that is that this is what freedom looks like   wallace began   but is the major decrease in the number of people   according to the cbo   who will have health insurance  is it freedom or is it that some people will no longer be able to afford health insurance under your plan  this isn t freedom   wallace continued   this isn t people voluntarily deciding not to have health insurance  it s that your plan makes it unaffordable for people  ryan responded by going on an incoherent rant about how the affordable acre act is  not going to last   even though republican sabotage is the reason why the affordable care act is having problems in the first place  and then he started talking about how the gop bill will make insurance plans less expensive even though wallace just got done telling him the exact opposite  we re not going to make people buy something that s so expensive that they can t afford  that the market is not going to offer   ryan said   and so where i dispute that comparison is it suggests that we re going to have the same kinds of plans being offered in  years that obamacare would otherwise offer  the person in their  or  does have additional health care costs than  say  a person in their  and  you re right in saying   and we agree   we believe we should have even more assistance and that s one of the things we re looking at for that person in their  and   we re going to let people buy what they want to buy   ryan continued   we re going to have more plans being offered  more choice and competition  he also claimed that gutting healthcare regulations would cause prices to drop here s the video via youtube ryan s argument in defense of trumpcare is that the cbo didn t examine everything  the problem is that if they had the gop plan would have looked even worse getting rid of regulations won t make healthcare more affordable  it just gives insurance companies more freedom to screw over their customers as the gop healthcare bill currently stands  senior citizens will end up paying ten times as much for healthcare than they do now the affordable care act created competition among health insurance companies and slowed down the rising cost of premiums while covering tens of millions of americans who previously could not afford coverage the gop bill repeals all of that and ryan s defense was not only confusing  it was full of empty promises in a desperate effort to convince the american people that republicans care about them featured image via screenshot
