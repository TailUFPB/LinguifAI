the nazis see donald trump as their pathway back to power so they are joining his campaign in droves it s not exactly a secret that white supremacists  including neo nazis and members of the kkk  are supportive of the republican nominee  but this election is especially different because of how emboldened they are about donald trump nazis in this country have been on the fringe of our society for decades  which is where they belong  but donald trump is giving them the seat at the mainstream table that they have desperately desired and republicans don t see any problem with that at all and that s why these racists are not only able to openly volunteer for trump campaign  they are able to openly brag about doing so and have no problem boasting about the goals they are trying to achieve  there s a connection   it isn t always policy   but a deep visceral  you could say emotional connection between the alt right and his campaign   white supremacist richard spencer told the los angeles times  i think he does recognize that he has this alt right army behind him  i think he also realizes if he backs down  if he stops being combative  he is in danger of losing that  indeed  donald trump has embraced white supremacists by retweeting their accounts on his own twitter feed and using rhetoric that appeals to them in fact  despite his attempt to paint democrats as the real racist fascists in this election  trump is actually the candidate that white nationalists are drawn to  virtually every alt right nazi i know is volunteering for the trump campaign   said white nationalist andrew anglin david duke  the former kkk leader who is running for the u s  senate in louisiana  bragged to the times that trump is where he is because of white supremacists   trump happened because of us   duke said   not the other way around  the fact that donald trump s doing so well  it proves that i m winning   duke continued   i am winning  and if david duke wins  it means the nazis and the kkk win  too so are we as americans really prepared to let the nazis take over the united states  because if they do  they ll have control of the greatest military on the planet and we need to remember that when hitler and the nazis took power in germany the first nation they conquered was their own and it resulted in concentration camps  indoctrination  loss of rights  and the eventual destruction of the entire nation  we can stop this new generation of nazis from gaining power in the united states simply by making sure trump loses by a landslide in november  if not  we may end up needing a coalition of nations to liberate us one day and that means world war iii donald trump and his white nationalist supporters need to be stopped before it is too late featured image  twitter
