one thing that has continuously dogged the donald trump for president campaign is the fact that racists  anti semites  xenophobes  misogynists  and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign  no matter how much trump s people try to say he doesn t want the support of such folks  the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously  so  naturally  when trump s campaign manager kellyanne conway sat down with an interview with cnn s jake tapper on sunday  that particular issue came up again  of course  conway was not happy  tapper began  there are a lot of anti semites and racists and misogynists who support the trump candidacy  conway immediately went on defense  saying   wow   tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting  jew s a  at the press pen at a recent trump rally  and directly asked conway if she would refer to such people as  deplorable   she responded  yes  i would  wow  i have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe   i hope you ve been to trump rallies and i hope that you ve seen the tens of thousands  i mean  he s had over half a million people easily  i think in excess of that  these are u s a  loving americans  tapper went on to say that no  he isn t putting all trump supporters into that camp  but went on to force conway s hand on this one  but without question  people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are anti semitic that has been offered to people who are anti semitic and racists and on and on  and these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting mr  trump mr  trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and anti semitic fans   tapper continued   he just has  he says things like   oh  sure  i disavow  i disavow   but he has never serious said   i don t want the support of those people  they are reprehensible  they have nothing to do with me   he has never seriously done it  conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the trump campaign is winning  saying  i think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence i have that we re actually going to win in nine days because the idea that we re going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that hillary clinton would bring to the oval office in such an important week  no  kellyanne  it s not a sign that trump is winning  it s pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began  that donald trump is a raging bigot  and he has been so openly  dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle  and it s all because of donald trump  he embraces these bigots because he s one of them  the quicker you learn that  the better watch the exchange below featured image via video screen capture
