while donald trump may have bribed carrier into keeping some  jobs in the united states with millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives   a dangerous precedent  as companies now know they only need to threaten to move out of the united states to get massive gifts from the trump administration   one thing he doesn t even acknowledge is that more jobs will still be going to mexico than will stay in the united states in a deal that even stalwart trump supporter calls a  hallmark of corruption  and  crony capitalism   trump and pence offered the company   million to keep a small portion of the jobs they planned to move across the border in indiana  the problem is that the company will still be moving   jobs trump and his crew refuse to speak about  but carrier was forthright with employees in a companywide letter explaining the donald s attempt to deceive the american public into thinking he was doing some actual good  while this announcement is good news for many  we recognize it is not good news for everyone   the letter tells employees  carrier explains that regardless of any deal with trump they intend to  move forward with previously unannounced plans  to relocate   jobs to mexico by the end of the year  we recognize that this has been very difficult for your families   the letter says  praising employees for continuing to work even knowing the company intended to f ck them over with or without donald trump s input   we greatly appreciate this and sincerely thank you for all your efforts  breaking  carrier confirms in letter to workers that fan coil jobs will  relocate  to mexico by end of      indythisweek pic twitter com   rafael s nchez   rafaelontv  december    s dangerous decision to show companies that he will give them special favors if they merely threaten to take jobs elsewhere will have far reaching impact  but the wall street journal says that another aspect of the deal   trump s threats against the company if they didn t comply   is far more dangerous than the bribe mr  trump s carrier squeeze might even cost more u s  jobs if it makes ceos more reluctant to build plants in the u s  because it would be politically difficult to close them yes  more jobs were lost than were saved and yes  trump just set a precedent for providing financial gifts to companies who threaten to take jobs elsewhere  but trump has managed to make it dangerous for companies to bring jobs here while he is president   something that we can expect will cause a lot of damage down the road featured image via getty images  tom pennington  screengrab
