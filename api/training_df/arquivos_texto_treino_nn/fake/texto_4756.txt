republican presidential nominee donald trump s first entrance to prominence in mainstream american politics was built on the same thing his entire horrific campaign has been built on  bigotry  specifically  bigotry against america s first black president  barack obama  trump led the racist charge that would come to be known as the  birther  movement  where he and his racist followers claimed that president obama is not a christian american who was born in hawaii  but was instead a muslim born in kenya of course  these wild claims have been debunked over and over again during obama s tenure as president  but that still has not convinced the donald  in fact  to this day  trump refuses to admit that he was wrong  and that indeed president obama was born right here in the united states of america  on monday  trump was asked if his views had changed on president obama s place of birth  and all he would say to reporters is   i don t talk about it  well  mr  trump  you spent months upon months publicly worrying over the president s birth certificate  ginning up racism from your fellow bigots who couldn t stand that there s a black family living in the white house  and no matter what president obama did   including releasing his long form birth certificate as you requested   nothing was good enough for you there s a reason for this  it s not about any sort of legitimate question regarding president obama s origins  but about pure  unabashed racism  and here you are  a few years later  as the standard   bearer for one of america s major political parties  and you still are peddling this racist conspiracy theory in an effort to damage president obama s legacy and deligitimize his time in the office of the presidency shame on you  donald trump  and  more to the point  shame on the republican party for allowing this man to carry your banner  and then claim that you don t tolerate and endorse racism  clearly  you do featured image via spencer platt getty images
