joe scarborough is furious about donald trump and he is demanding that republicans take action before our national security is seriously compromised throughout the  campaign  trump repeatedly criticized hillary clinton for using a personal server to read emails containing sensitive information  but while clinton s emails were never hacked or read by anyone but her  trump is going around bragging about highly classified intelligence and sharing it with the russians as we learned on monday  trump literally leaked the intel during an oval office meeting with russian officials last week  the same meeting that american journalists were barred from covering while russia state media was given free access in short  trump is a hypocrite who put the security of our nation in jeopardy because he is incapable of keeping his mouth shut so it was not a surprise that joe scarborough  a former republican congressman  exploded in anger on tuesday morning over what should be considered yet another russia scandal the morning joe host delivered a scathing statement denouncing trump and called upon the current republicans in congress to hold him accountable instead of cowardly ignoring a major breach of protocol  it s not enough for mitch mcconnell and conservative talk show hosts to simply attack the  lamestream  media or nancy pelosi   scarborough said   americans will not buy that  that s a cowardly act  and it s intended to hold onto as much of the audience that they can hold onto without embracing trump  at this point  if you do not call him out for risking american lives and doing things that most intel people i spoke with last night said will lead to the death of americans in the future or lead to the death of critical allies in this counterinsurgency battle against isis  then you are doing a grave disservice to your voters or to your listeners or to the united states of america  there is no middle ground here anymore   there just isn t  this is about national security in the united states of america  indeed  trump s blabbing put an asset at risk  one who is familiar with the inner workings of isis  a terrorist organization that wants to kill americans according to the washington post trump s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the islamic state the information the president relayed had been provided by a u s  partner through an intelligence sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the u s  government  officials said the partner had not given the united states permission to share the material with russia  and officials said trump s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the islamic state as a candidate  trump claimed that he would protect this country from isis  but by handing out classified information like it s candy  he just put our nation at serious risk and violated the trust of an asset  who is also now in serious jeopardy  which means our ability to get good intel on isis is compromised in the end  scarborough noted that donald trump just keeps getting worse  here s the problem  the arc of this narrative keeps getting worse  people on the inside say he keeps getting worse  mentally keeps getting worse  this is not  unfortunately  a learning curve   this is a man in decline  here s the video via vidme it s time for republicans to admit that they screwed up by supporting donald trump  it s time for them to oust this administration and schedule a new election so that the american people can put someone in the white house who is competent and not putin s puppet  this farce has gone on long enough and american lives are more in danger the longer trump remains in office featured image via screenshot
