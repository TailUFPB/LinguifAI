apparently  donald trump wanted to be president because he seriously thinks being president makes him immune to lawsuits  as usual  he s wrong during his campaign  trump often urged his supporters to physically assault protesters  and at a rally in kentucky in march   trump did exactly that and it caused a black woman to be assaulted as she was forced out of the venue  i was called a n    r and a c nt and got kicked out   university of louisville student shiya nwanguma recounted   they were pushing and shoving at me  cursing at me  yelling at me  called me every name in the book  they re disgusting and dangerous  in fact  the assault was caught on camera and revealed that alvin bamberger  matthew heimbach  and joseph pryor each contributed to the crime well  a lawsuit was filed against the men and donald trump himself of course  attorneys for trump were quick to try to claim presidential immunity to wriggle out of being held liable for the actions of the three men they argue that trump  is immune from suit because he is president of the united states  but that s not true at all and the supreme court says so back during bill clinton s presidency  the high court ruled that a president can be sued for action taken outside of the presidency  and since trump was not president in march  when he ordered the crowd to  get  em out of here  he can and will face this lawsuit u s  district judge david hale ruled earlier this month that the evidence indicates that trump is at least partially responsible for the actions of his supporters at rallies and even trump s own supporters are throwing him under the bus bamberger  who is a member of a veteran s association  claims his actions were provoked by trump  bamberger had no prior intention to act has he did   his attorneys wrote   bamberger would not have acted as he did without trump and or trump campaign s specific urging and inspiration  to the extent that bamberger acted  he did so in response to   and inspired by   trump and or trump campaign s urging to remove the protesters  bamberge is literally arguing that if he is found liable in court  so should trump  and that makes sense  after all  trump egged his supporters on every time protesters attended his rallies  he even once offered to pay for their defense if they roughed up protesters  so if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato  knock the crap out of him  would you   he said during a february rally   seriously  okay  just knock the hell  i promise you  i will pay for the legal fees  i promise  i promise  from that point forward  violence against protesters by trump supporters got even worse so trump will have to deal with more lawsuits  because no one  not even the president  is above the law featured image  win mcnamee getty images
