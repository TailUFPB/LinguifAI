rachel maddow decided to scrap a segment and go off script to warn her viewers about lieutenant general michael flynn  donald trump has offered flynn the position of national security advisor and the msnbc host finds this revelation too worrying to put off discussing  at this point in the show  i had something else we were going to cover  but i scrapped it because there s a thing i feel like i need to say about the mike flynn security announcement   maddow said maddow explained that no one  such as congress  has to approve this appointment in any way  trump makes the offer and if flynn accepts  then boom  it s a done deal  she then told america just why it is that this is such concerning news  so  this mike flynn thing is done   maddow explained   but the choice of mike flynn is a different kettle of fish than anything we might have expected from the trump campaign  mike flynn calls islam a political ideology hiding behind a religion  he calls islam a malignant cancer  he really did sit next to president putin and take money to go to a gala  he s been a frequent guest on russian state television  and says he sees no difference between russian state television  and for example  msnbc  after laying out her list of reasons why flynn shouldn t be considered for any government position  let alone at the top of national security  maddow explained to viewers what he will be doing in this position if he accepts it  he will now be the closest person to the president on a day to day basis on all foreign policy issues  on all military issues  on all national security issues  and he is way outside anything that anybody on the left  right or center might consider to be the mainstream  either in thought or temperament in terms of national security issues  and it s done   maddow said maddow laid out flynn s shady business dealings with turkey  she also slammed his habit of handing out classified information that he wasn t even supposed to have in the first place  which has happened at least twice  two former government officials with direct knowledge of the issue tell cnn that while flynn oversaw intelligence in afghanistan  he shared classified information with pakistan on terror networks responsible for killing american troops   cnn recalled this week when flynn s name was floated   the intelligence  the sources say  came from another agency  flynn wasn t supposed to share it  they say he was trying to convince pakistan to stop sheltering terrorists  maddow concluded  i know he s not going to get as much coverage as the other people who have to get confirmed over the next few days but stick a pin in that  it s really  really important  watch rachel maddow issue her dire warning about lt  gen  michael flynn  here featured image via video screen capture
