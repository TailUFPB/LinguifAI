donald trump s favorite morning propaganda program on fox news just got their asses handed to them for counting their chickens before they ve hatched ever since former fbi director james comey confirmed that trump is not personally under investigation for collusion with russia  fox news has been proclaiming victory and declaring that trump has been vindicated specifically  they have been calling the russia investigation a  nothingburger  on the sunday morning edition of fox   friends  hosts clayton morris and pete hegseth celebrated because they think the investigation is over now  only to have their bubble burst by veteran journalist and fox news sunday host chris wallace  who brutally reminded them that the investigation is nowhere near over because of a guy named michael flynn and another guy named jeff sessions morris claimed that the russia story  imploded   wallace responded by pointing out that attorney general jeff sessions is testifying to the senate intelligence committee and may detail trump s obstruction of justice  you know  because demanding the fbi director drop an investigation and then firing him for refusing to do so is interference and is the definition of obstruction that s when pete hegseth jumped in to try once again to assure viewers that the investigation against trump is done while also insulting comey and trying to turn the investigation on him instead  little evidence has been shown that there s collusion with russia   hegseth said  now we know that comey was a leaker  potentially multiple times  can the investigation move in those directions instead of the russia investigation  which is proven to be pretty much a nothingburger  wallace quickly disappointed hegseth with reality  i certainly wouldn t say it s a nothingburger   wallace said   we have to see where it goes  among other things  we still haven t heard from michael flynn  and he s one of the key figures in all of this  he was the one who had the most contacts russia  he s the one who got paid by russia  here s the video via youtube once again  chris wallace smacks down fox   friends for being trump s personal propaganda machine  wallace previously criticized the fox   friends crew in the aftermath of trump firing comey because they would not take the story seriously featured image via screenshot
