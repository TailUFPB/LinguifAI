while on the campaign trail in   donald trump told his supporters at a rally in south carolina  i m very highly educated  i know words  i know the best words  but there s no better word than stupid   trump was referring to president barack obama as  stupid   however  obama will be looked back fondly in history as probably one of our greatest presidents  a great orator who inspired the masses  and trump will not in january  trump began receiving his intelligence briefings and his team made a request for fewer words to be used and instead  to use more pictures the washington post reports the president  they said  was a visual and auditory learner  would the briefers please cut down on the number of words in the daily briefing book and instead use more graphics and pictures similarly  after trump entered office  his staff took president barack obama s syria contingency plans and broke the intelligence down into more digestible bites  complete with photos  according to current and former u s  officials with knowledge of the request according to senior administration officials and members of congress who spoke with trump  it was the image of young  listless children being splashed with water in a frantic attempt to cleanse them of the nerve agent and another one of an anguished father holding his twin babies  swathed in soft white fabric  poisoned to death  that prompted the alleged president to take action after watching cable news trump allegedly told his senior staff that the images and footage of what was taking place in syria was  horrible  and  awful  we can agree that it is  however  it s more likely that trump is using this as a distraction  after all  this widely circulated photograph of alan kurdi  a young refugee child who drowned to death  apparently never disturbed donald trump trump was also opposed to obama s attempt to strike syria when a sarin nerve gas attack left more than   dead outside of damascus in   there were images of children who were victims of that gas attack were reported online and on the news  too quick question  ever since trump ordered a strike on syria  how much of the news cycle has covered his administration s ties to russia  or his conflicts of interest  etc  etc  etc image of alan kurdi via wikipedia  image of the amateur president  screen capture via trump draws on twitter
