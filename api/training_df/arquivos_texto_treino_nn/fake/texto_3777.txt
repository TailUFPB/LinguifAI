for nigh on two years now  wise people have been warning against the normalization of donald trump  however  the media insisted on giving him and his outrageous travesty of a campaign billions of dollars in free advertising  and refused to convey one simple fact to the american people  donald trump is in no way fit to president and commander in chief  in fact  he is dangerously unfit  trump is clearly a narcissist  unbelievably vengeful and vicious  and in many ways seems to be very mentally unstable and unable to control his impulses  despite these obvious traits that would make anyone unsuited to be president  america has elected him  and now we re in grave danger  the worst part of it  the media is rushing to normalize him once again  and with that normalization comes more danger than ever  therefore no matter how much the media tells us to do so  no matter how many politicians tell us to do so  we must resist the normalization of this absolutely abnormal presidency  there s one person who is doing an amazing job of telling us just what we need to hear and understand  keith olbermann on gq s the closer  keith olbermann has been busily railing donald trump in ways the mainstream media refuses to do  now that trump is the president elect  he has come out with a brilliant video called  the resistance  in which he explains the grave danger we are in  and why trump must be resisted every step of the way  first  olbermann says that he himself will help lead those of us who understand how dangerous trump is  since no democratic or liberal politician has yet stepped forward out of the morass of politics  inc  to take on the responsibility of the resistance  i  with complete awareness of the presumptuousness and arrogance of this statement  volunteer myself  and i will gladly turn over all these burdens to any more legitimate and informed lawmaker or political or cultural leader who has the guts to take these burdens  then  olbermann goes on to lay into trump in spectacular fashion  laying out all of the reasons he cannot be accepted  and how we might go about making sure we never accept him as president  the first step is to complete the de legitimizing of his presidency and his election  de legitimizing that he himself began  sixty eight days until his inauguration  still bitching about his paranoid fantasies about the media  still lying about what he said during the campaign  still referring to himself in the third person  still obsessing over one newspaper  as if he were fifteen and it had refused to go with him to the junior prom  give him a chance  what  in the hope that he will someday grow up enough to be able to see over the top of the oval office desk  most importantly  olbermann then reminds us all just what the people insisting we should give trump a chance are really saying  all we are saying is  give fascism a chance    who knows  it might not be as bad as we think  it might not be a bottomless pit  after that  the bombastic host lays out his best zinger yet  though he is completely serious  we do not have time for the white house edition of  celebrity apprentice  starring president elect p ssy grabber  olbermann does warn against any crazy and or illegal tactics  though  saying  i do not want violence  i m not proposing the overthrow of the government by any means other than legal and political  i think protests should be limited to washington  trump tower and the trump hotels  i have no pie in the sky plan to have the electoral college alter the outcome somehow  i will even acquiesce to a president pence   just get this man out of here  keith olbermann is right  we need the truth here  and the truth is that this is how fascim takes over  we cannot allow trump to become normalized  and we cannot  not for a second  treat him as any sort of legitimate president  to do so is to see the end of democracy as we know it mr  olbermann  i salute you  and i proudly join your resistance to donald trump here is the must watch video  and i urge you to subscribe to the gq youtube channel  where  the resistance  will be a regular series to help us all navigate the donald trump fascist rule featured image via video screen capture
