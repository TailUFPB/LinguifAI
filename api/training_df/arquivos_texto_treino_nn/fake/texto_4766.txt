donald trump s signature issue since he began his travesty of a presidential campaign has been immigration  he won the primary by promising a bunch of ignorant  anti immigrant  racist  and otherwise bigoted voters in the gop base that he d deport all the brown people and build a giant wall to keep more of them from coming in  well  that was the primary  and this is general election  he and his campaign staff seem to have realized that they can t win with just a bunch of racists  so they are attempting to moderate that hardline message  but they have to be careful  because the base still has to be fed that red meat that got them onto team trump in the first place the result of this attempted balancing act has been a muddying of the water amongst trump s campaign staff and surrogates as they chase their tails all over television with no clear message regarding what will happen to all of the undocumented immigrants who are already here and contributing to american society  in fact  on sunday s edition of msnbc s meet the press  this was a topic of conversation  and one panel member pretty much summed up the issue here  trump himself doesn t know what the hell his own plan is on his signature issue  i don t know if donald trump knows what he is going to do with them     thefix on  mtp panel  meet the press   meetthepress  september    chuck todd also interviewed trump s running mate mike pence  and his answers weren t anymore satisfying  pence only returned to the false narrative that trump s positions on this issue are  consistent  pence on  mtp   i think donald trump has been completely consistent  on deportation policy https   t co   meet the press   meetthepress  september     since the american people deserve to know where a major party presidential candidate stands on such an important issue this far along in the election season  hillary s campaign manager robby mook decided to help us all out  he released a statement via the hillary for america website that reads  donald trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented  something that was reinforced in his speech in arizona last wednesday  beyond forcibly removing every single undocumented person from this country  trump has also promised to rescind daca and dapa  and deport american citizens who are born to undocumented immigrant parents  what we saw today is mike pence and trump s top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics   one of the oldest tricks in the book  immigrant families know the meanings of  humane  and  fair  and can see straight through their cynical ploys  trump s message to immigrant families is clear  everyone must go  this  of course  is the bottom line  the trump campaign wishes to muddy the waters  to make us all think he doesn t plan on erecting a deportation force to make all the brown people leave  so that we ll think he actually has some compassion for these people  nothing could be further from the truth  it doesn t matter to trump if you re a  year old woman who fled her home country  years ago to escape war or violence  if it was either enter the country illegally or face certain death   trump will deport you  and take you away from your documented children and grandchildren that s the kind of cold  cruel  callous approach that donald trump and his racist cronies have when it comes to this very complex and sensitive issue  make no mistake  they re just using different words now  but they mean exactly what has been said for the last  months   immigrants are the enemy  and they will be thrown out thankfully  though  hillary and her team have read the message loud and clear  and are making sure the american people understand just what that very scary message is featured image via instagram
