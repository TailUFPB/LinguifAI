the trump campaign and the conservative media have been having a field day with hillary s health  the idea that she s in really bad health is an absolutely asinine theory that s gotten to the point where some are circulating fake medical documents  while others  like martin  pharma bro  shkreli  who isn t anything like a doctor  are diagnosing her with things like parkinson s during a very recent stump speech  she stopped to cough  knowing that conservatives were going to pounce on her again for that  she said  every time i think about trump i get allergic  she s allergic to donald trump   aren t we all   this made the audience roar  and it s made others laugh  too  it s not difficult to be allergic to trump   his speeches are really nothing more than giant fountains of toxic waste  toxic waste contains all kinds of things that cause serious health conditions  so it s not too far a stretch to think it also triggers allergic reactions  since symptoms of allergies can include coughing  this is a totally  utterly  completely perfect comeback watch that segment of her speech below the trump campaign  of course  doesn t think it s so funny  kellyanne conway  trump s campaign manager  seized on hillary s comeback on twitter  she s very unhappy about this  must be allergic to media  finally spent a minute w  them  hillary has a nearly  minute long coughing fit  https   t co   kellyanne conway   kellyannepolls  september    speculation about hillary s health actually started two years ago with former chief republican dunce karl rove  rove wanted to know what was up with hillary being hospitalized for a concussion  and then reappearing with these glasses people wear when they ve got traumatic brain injuries   we need to know what s up with that   he said newsflash to rove and others who are harping on her for seemingly trying to hide a traumatic brain injury  a concussion is a traumatic brain injury but that s neither here nor there from that point on  conservatives who hate her  and trump s campaign  have seized on all manner of things that supposedly  prove  she s too sick to serve as president  she s not too sick  she s just allergic to trump  like most of the rest of the sane world featured image by justin sullivan getty images
