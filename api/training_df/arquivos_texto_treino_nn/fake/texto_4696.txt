it has been  years since the world trade center twin towers fell  but republicans and donald trump still exploit it for political gain during trump s primary run for the republican nomination  he made a claim that sent journalists into a frenzy of fact checking  i watched when the world trade center came tumbling down   trump said during a rally last november   and i watched in jersey city  new jersey where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down  thousands of people were cheering  trump doubled down the next day during an interview with george stephanopoulos  it was on television  i saw it   trump said   it was well covered at the time  george  now  i know they don t like to talk about it  but it was well covered at the time  there were people over in new jersey that were watching it  a heavy arab population  that were cheering as the buildings came down  not good  but what trump is claiming never happened after an exhaustive search  politifact concluded this defies basic logic  if thousands and thousands of people were celebrating the   attacks on american soil  many people beyond trump would remember it  and in the  century  there would be video or visual evidence instead  all we found were a couple of news articles that described rumors of celebrations that were either debunked or unproven trump s recollection of events in new jersey in the hours after the sept      terrorist attacks flies in the face of all the evidence we could find  we rate this statement pants on fire and on friday  new york rep  gregory meeks humiliated trump for that very claim once again during a panel discussion about trump s birtherism on cnn just like trump won t admit that he is wrong about his birtherism  trump has also not apologized for being wrong about muslims cheering in america on   after trump supporter kayleigh mcenany claimed that trump has renounced his birther past  meeks pointed out that trump himself should man up and publicly do it himself  then he should say it  if he believes it  he should say it  there s a pattern with donald trump  i m still looking   and i m sure that everybody s still looking   for those  thousands of muslims  that were cheering during    that has not taken place  we heard video where he says he was for the war in iraq  he now says he wasn t  there s not any evidence where he was against the war in iraq  there is a practice and pattern with donald trump  who continues to make noise he knows is completely incorrect   meeks continued   he never apologizes about it  he leaves it out there  here s the video via youtube donald trump is a coward and a liar and he is totally unqualified to be president  the  anniversary of   is on sunday and you just know that trump is going to make some outrageous claim in an effort to exploit the tragedy featured image  alex wong getty images
