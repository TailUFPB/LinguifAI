donald trump s most recent secretive actions toward the press are raising a lot of eyebrows and concerns while trump is on taxpayer paid golf vacation in florida  the undeserving potus has made sure that no one will know what the hell he s up to  to symbolize just how transparent his administration is  trump has blacked out all the windows of his  winter white house  and banned the press from taking any pictures and keeping tabs on him here s what ap reported jill colvin saw in the press pool area here s another photo of this disturbing activity politicususa obtained a white house pool report  which stated  the pool was escorted into the clubhouse after trump and abe were out of view and then led downstairs to a filing room  where we re told we ll be staying for awhile  the door and windows are covered with black plastic so we can t see out  photographers were instructed not to take pictures on the grounds of a  private club  while reporters may not always be blessed with ideal conditions when covering the president  being stuck in a basement with blacked out windows is highly problematic  this couldn t possibly be any more shady  basically  american taxpayers just sent trump on a paid vacation  and he s literally hiding from them this shouldn t really be a surprise  considering the fact that trump has ditched his press pool a few times before and has expressed a distinct hatred for journalists and the press as a whole  however  what trump is doing is highly unethical  when you run for the highest office in the country  you work for the american people now and your life is no longer private  what trump is trying to do is keep american citizens in the dark  and it is beyond disturbing  this is not how presidents should act featured image via drew angerer   getty images
