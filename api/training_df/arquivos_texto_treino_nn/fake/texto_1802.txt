rep  markwayne mullin  r okla   held a town hall earlier this week and it did not go well for him  the republican congressman told his constituents that taxpayers don t pay his salary and saying otherwise is  bullcrap  you say you pay for me to do this  that s bullcrap   video shows mullin saying  i pay for myself  i paid enough taxes before i got here and continue to through my company to pay my own salary  this is a service  no one here pays me to go   he added go figure  no one was impressed with his remarks  when his constituents pushed back  mullin tried to spin his comments  saying   this is a service for me  not a career  and i thank god this is not how i make my living  amy lawrence  mullin s spokeswoman  told the press that he was just trying to say that he doesn t want to be a  career politician   that s all  the congressman reiterates in the video that his work as the representative of the second district of oklahoma is a service   lawrence said  his aspiration is to be a career legislator and not a career politician  he is not  nor does he ever aspire to be  a career politician  his priority will always be to serve his constituents to the best of his ability  mullins owns mullin plumbing  a lucrative company with multiple smaller subsidiaries  but comprehending exactly how this negates the salary he earns as a congressman requires a special type of mental gymnastics  for the record  base pay for a u  s  congressman is    the good news for mullin is that after telling his constituents that they don t pay his salary  he probably won t have to worry about the possibility of becoming a career politician you can watch mullin sabotage his career below  featured image via wikipedia
