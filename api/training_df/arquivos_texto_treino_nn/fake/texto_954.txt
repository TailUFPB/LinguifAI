this week  donald trump joined a collection of scientists  engineers  and astronauts to sign an executive order renewing the national space council  it was not exactly a meeting of the minds trump had a prepared speech but at several points veered wildly off script  leaving the people standing around him   including renowned former astronaut and national hero buzz aldrin   to squirm  grimace  and cringe at the sheer stupidity of what was coming out of his mouth  even worse  on the very same day trump was holding the photo op  the last three members of the white house science office  all holdovers from the obama administration  left the job  trump hasn t bothered to staff the office with anyone else  science is not exactly a priority of his the awkward affair was caught by television cameras meant to record the event and aldrin s pained expression quickly went viral buzz aldrin thinking he would much rather live on the moon right now pic twitter com   paul szoldra   paulszoldra  july    the time  trump was rambling about  space    a concept he apparently did not fully understand  and security is going to be a very big factor with respect to space and space exploration   at some point in the future  we re going to look back and say how did we do it without space  those are words  sure  but what is he trying to say  nobody in the room seemed to know making matters worse  near the end of the signing  aldrin cracked a joke that went so far over trump s head it could have landed on the moon  as trump sat down to sign the order  aldrin said  to infinity and beyond   the reference to toy story s resident space ranger was missed on trump who came out with this incredible word salad about the concept of  infinity  this is infinity here   it could be infinity   we don t really don t know   but it could be   it has to be something   but it could be infinity  right  buzz aldrin once decked a crackpot stalker who was harassing him by shouting that the moon landing had been faked  now  he s forced to stand next to a man with just as many crackpot ideas and call him  mr  president   his face says it all featured image via twitter
