during donald trump s most recent press conference on wednesday  he mentioned that  million americans were looking for jobs and could not find any  well  as it turns out  that number is only about  times higher than the truth according to mr  trump america has millions of  workers right now in the united states that are    million really wanting a job and they can t get  you know that story  the real number   that s the real number  that s incorrect  by quite a bit  now  maybe if he hadn t repeated that he believed  that s the real number  then he could have recovered from the situation  if he had said   million  he would have at least been in the right ball park  america does have  million people without jobs  but that s including anyone above  years of age that is a student  disabled  a stay at home parent  retired or not in the workforce for whatever reason  not actively searching for a job the actual number of americans that are jobless but actively seek work is only   million  add another   million for  missing workers   those who are unemployed and don t seek work because they don t see much opportunity  that number is   million workers  so maybe donald trump was confused or very misinformed  either way these numbers are certainly something he should be aware of trump is also probably unaware of the fact that the economy is doing great right now  with   million private sector jobs being added in the last six and a half years thanks to president obama  however  according to donald trump obama has done nothing good for this country  is he in denial or just an idiot  maybe if he went to his intelligence briefings every once in awhile he d know what he was talking about more often featured image via spencer platt getty images
