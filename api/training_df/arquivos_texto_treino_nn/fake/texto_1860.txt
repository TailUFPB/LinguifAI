while many have been baffled and upset by donald trump s reckless decision to attack syria  without congressional approval   the inner details of what drove trump to make such a decision are even worse senior white house officials have just confessed that this attack against syria was nothing more than a publicity stunt for trump  to feed his out of control ego  according to those officials  the poorly planned missile strike  which ultimately failed  isn t even part of a broader strategy or a step in a larger plan to remove assad  it was absolutely meaningless  and its only purpose was to make trump seem like a strong leader cnn s jim acosta reported while it s not surprising that trump has no strategy for syria  let s face it  he has zero strategy for anything he does   it s terrifying to actually see it play out before our eyes as an incompetent president puts america in grave danger basically  trump used the u s  military to make it look like he was taking some sort of action on syria  when really the exact opposite is true  there is no plan  and there likely will never be one  what trump put on last night was merely a performance   and a damaging one  already  u s  russia relations have grown more tense as russia is making moves to punish america for trump s carelessness the message trump is sending to the world is terrifying   what we can expect during trump s presidency is a show  just big empty gestures that won t actually carry any weight  trump has basically shown assad that he s not really going to do anything besides send  missiles his way  now assad   and the rest of the world   knows our president is all talk and almost no action  the strength and leadership that america once had in the world is disintegrating quickly featured image via pool   getty images
