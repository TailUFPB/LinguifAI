when donald trump allowed popular nazi blog the gateway pundit to have a correspondent show up at the white house  many questioned that decision   but if the donald was going for comic relief  we re forced to admit that the inclusion of lucian wintrich is a complete success recently  the white house reporter followed up on a hot tip he received from noted twitter political sociologist guy krang t  nelson informing america that  antifa   a blanket term for people who oppose fascism  is breeding a team of super soldiers  yes  like in marvel comics  which they will unleash on america in a devastating attack on white people   a first strike in a new civil war he reported on completely seriously in a now disappeared scare piece  can t wait for november  when millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents and the small business owners in the town square   krang tweeted   an obvious joke  unless you re a f cking idiot enter wintrich  who reported it completely seriously then threw a massive tantrum when the obviously humorous comment turned out to be fake in addition  a bunch of right wingers mass reported krang s post and got him suspended from twitter  anyone with a single crease in their brain could see that my post was satire  but alas  the internet has no shortage of morons  and the tweet was apparently reported into oblivion   krang t  nelson said of the attack in an op ed he wrote for vice   the ensuing suspension was so thorough that my work account was axed for using the same phone number   i reached out to twitter for comment in connection with this story  but had yet to hear back at the time of publication   it s worth noting that donald trump has not once been suspended from twitter unfortunately  this is common fare for the stupid part of america  they genuinely believe that hillary clinton is running a child sex slavery operation out of the basement of a pizza restaurant that doesn t even have a basement  that  antifa  is going to murder white women  or even that malia obama got herself arrested buying six pounds of marijuana and somehow managed to fit it into a prada handbag  but when the truth comes out they blame the people who are laughing at them instead of themselves for being so goddamn stupid wintrich is just the latest example that the party of fake news and personal responsibility produces the majority of the former and has no sense of the latter featured image via screengrab
