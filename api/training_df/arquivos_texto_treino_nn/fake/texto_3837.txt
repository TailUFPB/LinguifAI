well  well  well  look what we have here during his meeting with president obama  donald trump apparently was convinced that repealing obamacare is probably not a good idea after all according to the wall street journal  trump told reporters after the meeting that he may just simply  amend  obama s signature healthcare law and said he would consider suggestions the president made during their discussion  either obamacare will be amended  or repealed and replaced   trump said   i told him i will look at his suggestions  and out of respect  i will do that  it s not a guarantee  but it s definitely a reversal from he has been telling his supporters throughout his campaign for the last year and a half republicans have been trying to destroy the healthcare law for years and even shut the government down in protest of the law  they were hoping donald trump would be a rubber stamp to their agenda and now it turns out president obama may have reasoned with trump  and considering over   americans have signed up for an obamacare health plan already this year and repealing the law could seriously hurt millions of americans  including conservatives  it looks like trump has changed his tune on a core campaign promise and of course  his supporters are already starting to throw a hissy fit about it  thehill keep your promise and repeal it don t sell us out before you are sowrn in keep your word  don t let us down  ernie   grandpasof  november    thehill watch it  this is not why i voted for you  you said  repeal and replace   hell  hillary was going to  keep parts of obamacare  suzy z     november    wsj wrong   wrong   wrong   wrong   it must be totally repealed  mr dane a wolfe   mrdaneawolfe  november     wsj  donald trump willing to keep parts of health law https   t co rlrkqlrtgd what  we haven t heard that from trump yet  maybe    ok   deplorable highlandr     november    wsj hahahahaha not even sworn in yet and backing off one of the most fucked up laws in the books obamacare sucks and needs to end    jeff berghuis   jeffsberghuis  november    trump actually keeps or repeals obamacare is yet to be seen  but it s entertaining watching his supporters lose what s left of their minds whining about being lied to by a known liar featured image  pete souza
