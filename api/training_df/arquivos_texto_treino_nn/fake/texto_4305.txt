mike lee  r utah  has been a major figure in among congressional republicans in the  nevertrump movement   following the release of audio recordings from  that show just how much of a violent misogynist donald trump actually is  lee has called for trump to drop out of the race   lee posted a video to his facebook page where he gives a scathing response to trump  during the video the senator says  if anyone spoke to my wife or my daughter or my mother or any of my five sisters the way  has spoken to women  i wouldn t hire that person  i wouldn t hire that person  wouldn t want to be associated with that person  and i certainly don t think i d feel comfortable hiring that person to be the leader of the free world  lee is absolutely correct  imagine if trump sat down in a job interview and the person interviewing him heard what trump said in   no one in their right mind would hire a person like that  that isn t all lee had to say  he goes on to lambast the republican nominee calling for him to drop out and let someone else run in his place   your conduct  sir  is the distraction  it s the distraction from the very principles that will help us win in november  you yourself  sir  mr  trump  have stated repeatedly that the goal  the objective  has got to be to defeat hillary clinton in november  i couldn t agree more  mr  trump  i respectfully ask you  with all due respect to step aside  step down  allow someone else to carry the banner of these principles  trump has no experience  no civility  and no practical policy ideas  if he was a prospective employee for any modern company  he would not be hired  it s ridiculous to think that a person whose public behavior would  keep them out of even entry level positions could possibly be deemed qualified to be the president of the united states  what every voter in the united states needs to ask themselves   especially women   is if they would enjoy having trump as a boss  would they feel comfortable working in an environment where they knew that their boss held openly violent misogynistic views  how about f the fathers and husbands out there knew that their wife or daughter was working for a man like trump  i certainly wouldn t and i couldn t think of a single person who would want to live in such a nightmare scenario  lee cannot say it  though he must know that having trump drop out of the race at this point in the election would mean a landslide victory for hillary clinton  it could also possibly do major in down ballot elections across the nation  further jeopardizing the gop s control of congress  lee and others appear willing to take that risk to prevent a trump administration  that should tell every voter out there just exactly how important it is to keep trump out of office watch featured image from video screenshot
