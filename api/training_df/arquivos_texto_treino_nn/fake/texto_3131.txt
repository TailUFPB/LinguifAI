if you or your conservative friends  as many still do  ever believed that the iraq war was a response for    the cia finally put that myth to rest  not only was the iraq war one of the most fiscally and internationally irresponsible moves the george w  bush administration could have made  it was based on lies and  as the cia just confirmed  a political agenda as recently as a year ago  polls were conducted that said that more than half of americans still believe the lie that saddam hussein was responsible for    he wasn t  the success of that massive lie is no doubt what led us to the fact free world which gave us donald trump instead of waiting to gather all the intelligence  according to the cia  the bush administration was fully committed to pulling the trigger immediately following the attack on the world trade center and the pentagon discussing the first days of the bush administration on bbc radio  s today programme   former cia analyst john  nixon said   we had gotten word that they saw iraq as  unfinished business   we never really understood at that point what unfinished business meant  but we knew that they wanted to do something  he added   you know  they had their minds made up from day one  and then after    that s when the death warrant for saddam hussein was signed  source  independentnixon didn t offer any speculation as to why bush had it in for hussein  but a number of explanations have been floated  such as it was  as nixon seems to imply  the younger bush finishing what his father started when the george bush sr  invaded iraq  another possible explanation is even worse  it s war profiteering  plain and simple  it s also highly likely that it was both  the bottom line  though  is that we never should have been in iraq and that was a giant failing of not just washington  but of our media  unfortunately  neither the media nor washington seems to have learned their lessons and we will be led by lies from now until at least the end of the trump administration featured image via mike heffner getty images
