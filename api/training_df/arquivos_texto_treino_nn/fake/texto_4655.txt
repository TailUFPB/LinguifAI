if you haven t noticed  but you probably have  the news media never calls republican presidential nominee donald trump out on his constant lying the most recent example of this was during the nbc commander in chief forum when matt lauer went really hard on hillary clinton when it came to demanding answers  and then was ridiculously soft on trump  even though trump believes lauer was too hard on him well  one person in particular is absolutely fed up with these media shenanigans and that person is samantha bee of tbs s  full frontal  bee said  there s no time to report the facts and what people feel are the facts  you ve got to choose one  guys  we are swimming in bad information  our dads are on facebook  chemtrails are not real  dad  adding  why can t the media just tell us what s true and what s bullsh t  bee also points out that many in the media are refusing to call trump out for lying because then it could appear that they are biased with their own opinion  however  she lays to rest that common misconception when she says  calling a liar a liar isn t an opinion if you can prove it  that s what we call a fact  the idea that news network executives traded their balls for ratings  that s just my opinion  and as many in the media are trying to make donald trump and hillary clinton somehow equal when it comes to being qualified  or equally as bad  they are clearly mistaken  bee lets them have it and does not hold back  saying  maintaining the image of fairness requires them to portray hillary and trump as equally flawed candidates  even though they know that s incorrect  on the one hand you have the most breathtakingly  unqualified  ignoramus to of heave his balls within striking distance of office  a race baiting bully who  according to two meticulously researched biographies  is a tax cheating  investor swindling  worker  shafting  dictator loving  pathologically lying  attorneys general bribing  philandering  mobbed up  narcissistic serial con artist who hasn t got the attention span to read a fortune cookie much less a f cking intelligence briefing  adding  but on the other hand  hillary used a private email server  see  perfectly even  boom yeah  not exactly even  trump is the last thing we need for this nation in general  let alone as commander in chief well f cking done  sam watch same bee tear the media a new one here featured image via video screen capture  ht c l
