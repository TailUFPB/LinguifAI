can somebody tell this piece of shit congressman that the emergency room is is not healthcare coverage on tuesday  gop rep  jason chaffetz told low income americans that if they want healthcare they should stop buying iphones  even though an iphone is ten times cheaper per year than the average health insurance premium  you know what  americans have choices  and they ve got to make a choice   chaffetz said   and so maybe  rather than getting that new iphone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on  maybe they should invest in their own health care  a monthly payment plan for an iphone is under   while health insurance costs over   a month  far more than millions of americans can afford  even if they didn t buy an iphone  in fact  it would take approximately ten months to save up for just one month of health insurance coverage and now another republican lawmaker has an idea that is just as asinine and just as heartless  and it s one of the reasons why the affordable care act was passed in the first place emergency room care has bankrupted many americans over the years  that s because many people can t afford health insurance to pay for check ups and annual physicals or get preventive care  so minor health issues become emergency health crises  the average price of a single emergency room visit is     and that means such visits can cost more than that  even if all you have is indigestion that causes chest pains these costs can cripple people financially  and that s why the affordable care act was passed  so that low income americans would finally have access to affordable health insurance they can use to visit their doctors regularly republicans like north carolina rep  mark meadows  however  think emergency room care is perfect coverage first  meadows told cnn host alisyn camerota that he agrees with chaffetz s remark about iphones  well  they re already making choices now for those kind of things   meadows said   i ve talked to a number of people having to make choices between  you know  do they put food on the table or pay for the health care  right  so repealing the affordable care act would mean millions of americans would have to once again choose between feeding themselves and their families or paying for healthcare then meadows spewed a bunch of bullshit about how republicans are going to cover more people at less cost  we re all in to help to make sure we get more people covered at less cost  and so that s a choice that i don t want any american to make  i certainly don t want my family to make  as we look at that health care coverage  and certainly health care in general  it s something we need to make sure it s something everybody has access to  again  by repealing the affordable care act  republicans are stripping  million americans of their healthcare and will actually make healthcare costs skyrocket after the law slowed down the rising costs by reducing the number of emergency room bills that hospitals usually have to eat because patients can t afford to pay furthermore  meadows went on to claim that emergency room care is the same as having health insurance  well  we ve got  million people  the goal is to allow access to all  there s a federal law right now that if you show up at a hospital  you get coverage  alisyn  and so  it s a false narrative to suggest we have people who can t go in and get coverage  it s a federal law  here s the video via youtube that law is there to guarantee that anyone who needs emergency care will not be turned away  it s not meant as an umbrella insurance coverage program and could never actually be one if republicans seriously believe the emergency room is a suitable substitute for universal healthcare then it is clear they don t care about the health of the american people at all it should also be pointed out that meadows and his family do not have to worry about choosing between food and healthcare because his healthcare is covered by the government and paid for by taxpayers basically  republicans think it s okay for them to have government provided healthcare  but everyone else should be forced to rely on overcrowded emergency rooms  it s time to change that  and we can start by taking healthcare away from republicans like meadows  because if america can t have universal healthcare paid for by the government  our elected officials shouldn t get it either featured image via sreenshot
