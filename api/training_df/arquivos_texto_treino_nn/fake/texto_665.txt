it looks like donald trump is going to be a one term president of course  that s assuming he isn t impeached or indicted before his four year term comes to an end  but even if trump does avoid those scenarios  he cannot avoid the wrath of voters in  and it turns out that trump s own voter base is turning against him during the  election   percent of white voters without a college degree voted for trump  which speaks volumes about the importance of a good education in june   percent of those voters still supported trump and approved of his job performance the latest quinnipiac poll  however  has bad news for trump and the republican party trump s support among white voters without a college degree has slipped to under  percent indeed  only  percent now approve of the way he is doing his job  and his numbers are cratering among white men and women  right now   percent of white men still approve of trump  but that s down from the  percent who voted for him  trump s number among white women are even worse as a whopping  percent disapprove of him in a statement about the poll numbers  assistant director of the quinnipiac poll had a laundry list of reasons why trump s numbers have fallen through the floor  it s hard to pick what is the most alarming number in the troubling trail of new lows for president donald trump  profound embarrassment over his performance in office and deepening concern over his level headedness have to raise the biggest red flags  the daily drip drip of missteps and firings and discord are generating a tidal wave of bad polling numbers  overall  the poll showed that only  percent of americans approve of trump while  percent disapprove this is a disaster for republicans that will only get worse as long as trump remains in office  and it s unlikely that republicans will keep trump off the ballot in  because they don t want to anger the extremists in their party  and that could have a down ballot effect that really comes down like a sledgehammer on the gop  if republicans don t lose the senate and house in   they almost certainly will in  with a very unpopular trump on the ballot it s also a major blow to trump s fragile ego  he still thinks everyone loves him and he will likely think the same going into the  election  and then he will be totally humiliated when he becomes the one term president that president obama never was despite how desperately republicans tried to sabotage him featured image via steve pope getty images
