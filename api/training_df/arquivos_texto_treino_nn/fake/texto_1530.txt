after kicking the morning off with a tweet storm attacking democrats for criticizing his choice to fire fbi director james comey  trump only seemed to make matters worse as the day went on while meeting with pool reporters in the white house  trump gave a public explanation for the termination of comey  and accidentally made himself look horrible in the process  keeping his message short and sweet  trump said that the reason he fired comey was because  he wasn t doing a good job  very simply  he was not doing a good job  you can watch that baffling moment below  where trump cluelessly insults himself and ignored every question about russia before kicking all the reporters out that s certainly a strange thing for trump to say  because by now he must know that his own approval rating is historically low and it continues to plummet with every failure his administration suffers  if trump agrees that an fbi director can be fired for their poor performance  it only makes sense that the same should apply to trump there s overwhelming evidence that trump s job performance sucks   and it s not just his disastrous approval rating or the fact that polls show that most americans want him out  from trump s failed muslim travel ban to his disgusting american health care act  trumpcare   trump s first  days have been filled with failure after failure  there have been several times where trump had to resort to taking credit for former president barack obama s work just to save his image america is so much worse off now that trump is in the white house  and if the country has to suffer through the rest of his term  the damage may be irreversible by the time we get a more qualified potus  but today  trump accidentally said those magic words  if comey can be fired for doing a bad job  so should he featured image via pool   getty images
