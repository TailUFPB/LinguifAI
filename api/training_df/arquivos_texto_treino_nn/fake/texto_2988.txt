americans are waking up  after being promised trump would change his tune once elected  the people have been shown that he will not  in any sense of the word  change his tune he s still the same loud  obnoxious  shady  thin skinned demagogue he was when he announced his candidacy it s because of this  and other damning information  that the american people are giving him low approval ratings  and rightly so  in fact  his approval ratings have hit a record and historic low for any incoming president a new gallup poll shows that  percent of americans hold a negative view of trump  while  percent have a favorable view according to the poll president elect donald trump approaches inauguration day with a significantly lower favorable rating than his three immediate predecessors received when they were presidents elect  trump s   favorable rating is roughly half of what barack obama enjoyed before his inauguration in      and is much lower than the pre inaugural ratings for george w  bush     and bill clinton       of the four most recent incoming presidents  trump is the only president elect whose unfavorable rating outweighs his favorable score the best part lies within his own party  he has a lower approval rating from republicans than any other gop president  while george bush nabbed  percent approval among the gop  trump only has  percent like trump  mike pence and melania trump also face historic low approval ratings for the vice presidency and first lady respectively america really hates donald trump and his ilk  that s a start congratulations  america  you elected a universally hated fascist who picks fights with john lewis instead of vladimir putin gallup summed up what will be the state of the union for the next few months but he enters office with a significantly more negative image than prior presidents elect have had and with a less positive image even among those who identify with his own party  the president elect s general unpopularity is an unprecedented hurdle  whose impact on his ability to govern remains to be seen trump was illegitimately elected  lost the popular vote  and is hated by the american people  he has absolutely no mandate  no legitimacy  no room to bargain  the honeymoon is officially over featured image via drew angerer getty images
