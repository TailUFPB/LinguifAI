vermont sen  bernie sanders knows that most trump supporters voted out of fear and anger rather than actual policy or facts   and he found a way to perfectly expose this truth on national television for all to see  during an msnbc town hall in kenosha  wisconsin  aka  trump country    sanders confronted trump voter gail sparks about her inaccurate views on what trump actually stood for sparks admitted that she hadn t voted in   but got herself to the polls for trump this year because she wanted change  she connected with his fear mongering about undocumented immigrants   she even called them  those people  and accused them of stealing jobs and being the reason she made less money  but when sparks brought up the social safety net  sanders couldn t take it anymore and had to stop her in her tracks to give her the facts  sparks said  who s paying for this  who s paying for the medicaid  who s paying for the social security  who s paying for the medicare  now  have any of you seen down on the streets that it seems as though we have become the silent minority and not the majority  msnbc host chris hayes asked sparks who she was talking about and sparks responded  the people who need the medicare  the people who need the social security  who need the help with the education  that s when sanders respectfully decided to prove to her that she d made the wrong choice when she voted  sanders said  good point  let s see if we can go forward on this  i am assuming that you believe  correct me if i m wrong  that we should not cut social security or medicare or medicaid  is that correct or not  sanders let sparks agree that the social safety net shouldn t be cut before dropping an epic truth bomb  he continued  do you know who is now working very hard to try to do that  republicans in congress have a plan under the guise of saving medicare and saving social security  making devastating cuts  that s what the republicans are now trying to do  as sanders went on  a look of shock  disappointment and embarrassment washed across sparks  face   but sanders didn t stop  the other point that you made is  who is going to pay for this stuff  and that is a very fair point  what all of us should know is that over the last  years  there has been a massive transfer of wealth in this country from you to the top one tenth of one percent  in other words  the middle class has shrunk and trillions of dollars have gone to the top one tenth of one percent  do you think it s inappropriate to start asking those people to pay their fair share of taxes so we can adequately fund medicaid and make public colleges and universities tuition free  is that an unfair thing to ask  sparks took a second to digest what sanders was saying and replied  i don t think it s an unfair thing to ask  they got rich off of us  so it s time they put back  sanders said   okay  that s what i m saying  this conversation between sparks and sanders proves that a lot of trump supporters have no idea what trump and the gop are actually doing  and they re just as unclear on trump s policies as he is  you can watch this amazing conversation with sanders below  starting at about the   minute mark featured image via screenshot
