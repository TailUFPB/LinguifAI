one twitter user it put it this way  thanks to his love of social media  we are watching the president of the united states have a mental collapse right in front of our eyes  in real time  it may explain why psychologists have noted a steep rise in cases of anxiety since the election  the man in charge   already the least qualified in u s  history   is plainly not well and speculation over trump s mental health has only gotten worse since the release of a damning associated press interview in which he seems incapable of stringing together even a single coherent sentence  the full transcript is depressingly bonkers  but here s a taste trump  ok  the one thing i ve learned to do that i never thought i had the ability to do  i don t watch cnn anymore ap  you just said you did trump  no  no  i  if i m passing it  what did i just say  inaudible  ap  you just said  trump  where  where ap  two minutes ago and here s another you have to love people  and if you love people  such a big responsibility   unintelligible  you can take any single thing  including even taxes  i mean we re going to be doing major tax reform  here s part of your story  it s going to be a big  unintelligible   everybody s saying   oh  he s delaying   i m not delaying anything  i ll tell you the other thing is  unintelligible   i used to get great press  i get the worst press  i get such dishonest reporting with the media  that s another thing that really has   i ve never had anything like it before  it happened during the primaries  and i said  you know  when i won  i said   well the one thing good is now i ll get good press   and it got worse   unintelligible  so that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me  i thought the press would become better  and it actually  in my opinion  got more nasty the interview goes on like that   a rambling  incoherent word salad   for its entire duration  adding to that is trump s own twitter behavior  which has gone from unhinged to something far more unsettling  he s at the point where his persecution complex  or his anger  or his mental health crisis has reached such an intensity that he can t even remember to finish his  character thoughts  this morning  trump woke up still angry that he s the most unpopular president at his  day mark in america s history  he lashed out the wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth  and many others   if  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    if what  he never says  for two hours  the  if  has hung on the end of his mini meltdown without an answer  he lost his train of thought within the span of two tweets two hours later  trump tweeted a completely unrelated message  congratspeggy  https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    these reasons and more  mental health professionals have been begging congress to look into whether trump is mentally fit to serve as president  by his own actions  trump is raising serious doubts as to whether he can be tasked with such a great responsibility update  three hours later  someone on trump s staff finally told trump to finish his thought  the wall is not built  which it will be  the drug situation will never be fixed the way it should be  buildthewall  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    image via mark wilson getty images
