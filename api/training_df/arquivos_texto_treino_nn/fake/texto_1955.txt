for some reason  donald trump decided to speak to a group of women at a women s empowerment event on wednesday  on one of the final days of women s history month  it didn t go well first he bragged about the number of women in his cabinet  there are six women  out of   that s  percent  less than half of what would be representative of the nation as a whole  it s also the whitest and most male cabinet since ronald reagan it got worse  trump went on to name women  famous women  although there s no indication that trump knew why many of them were famous  the first part wasn t soooooo bad  since the very beginning  women have driven  and i mean  each generation of americans  towards a more free and more prosperous future   trump said   these patriots are women like the legendary abigail adams  right  who  during the founding  urged her husband to remember the rights of women  she was very much a pioneer in that way  we ve been blessed with courageous heroes like harriet tubman who escaped slavery  and went on to deliver hundreds of others to freedom  first in the underground railroad and then as a spy for the union army  she was very  very courageous  believe me  source  raw storyit very quickly became clear he was out of his intellectual element when he completed that thought with around we ve had leaders like susan b  anthony  have you heard of susan b  anthony  i m shocked that you ve heard of her   who dreamed of a much more fair and equal future and an america where women themselves as she said helped to make laws and elect the lawmakers  and that s what s happening more and more  of course  it s not shocking at all that a group of women have in fact heard of the suffragette and all around social justice warrior  there was even a coin with her face on it  but to be fair  it s doubtful trump carries cash  other people pay all of his bills trump  though  had clearly never heard of anthony  at least before someone briefed him right before the event here s the video perhaps trump s handlers  whoever they are  need to remind the orange dictator that he should never  ever speak to people who aren t white and male featured image via video screen capture
