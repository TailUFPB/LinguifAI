donald trump may call his disaster of a raid in yemen last week a  success   but the rest of the world views it as just one of the more deadly ways in which he has demonstrated his ineptitude   and now we are paying the price not only did trump completely miss his main target  qassim al rimi   who is currently mocking him  but the poorly planned raid slaughtered  civilians including  women and children  one of them a u s  citizen   three u s  service members were injured and a navy seal was killed so what went wrong  everything trump reportedly decided to go ahead with the raid over dinner after his cabinet convinced him it was the right thing to do by telling him that obama would not have the balls to go through with him  seriously  that s all it took   according to a senior u s  intelligence official   almost everything went wrong  once the team arrived  officials say trump approved the attack without sufficient intelligence  ground support or adequate backup preparations   on top of failing to kill his target  slaughtering civilians wholesale  murdering a u s  citizen  and getting a seal killed with his bumbling mess of an operation  the intel that was gathered is garbage  the military is touting three videos they recovered from the raid as evidence of success   but the videos are a decade old and available on youtube because of all this  yemen has decided that they don t want trump coming in and wrecking their living room again  the new york times reports angry at the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first commando raid authorized by president trump  yemen has withdrawn permission for the united states to run special operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country  according to american officials grisly photographs of children apparently killed in the crossfire of a  minute firefight during the raid caused outrage in yemen  a member of the navy s seal team   chief petty officer william owens  was also killed in the operation while the white house continues to insist that the attack was a  success    a characterization it repeated on tuesday   the suspension of commando operations is a setback for mr  trump  who has made it clear he plans to take a far more aggressive approach against islamic militants  the fool of the white house got slapped at the beginning of his road in your lands  al rimi said in a video following trump s failed raid  yemen s decision not to let trump play with his toys in their house is a bit uncomfortable for the donald  who promised to step up our approach to fighting terrorism  now that he is president  he has done nothing but hurt that effort watch a report on the raid below featured image via getty images pool
