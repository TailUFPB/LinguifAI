the election of reality television star donald trump has people all over the world responding in various ways  some of us are in total shock  despair and disbelief  and some of us are finding creative ways to resist this presidency  first amendment lawyer floyd abrams is amongst those raising eyebrows with an unprecedented suggestion for americans on wednesday night  during a dinner hosted by the media law resource center  the top lawyer made a suggestion that shocked everyone  first  he called trump  the greatest threat to the first amendment since the passage of the sedition act of    and then he surprised everyone again when he suggested that reporters should think about suing trump when abrams  who is the most well known first amendment lawyer in the country  was asked for clarification  he said  it s seems to be that in light of the attacks made by then candidate trump against the press on a continuing basis his preventing certain journalists from even attending his rallies as part of the press corps because he disapproved for their writing  and his public comments about wanting to loosen american libel law the press ought to be thinking broadly about how to defend itself if his administration turns out to be as antagonistic to the press as may be the case  abrams also cited libel law  and suggested that trump be sued by the media for defamation  abrams warned the press that it should be trying to protect itself  as trump has threatened several times to prevent the media from speaking negatively about him  it may well be necessary to think outside the box in response to a deliberately repressive administration  it s because the level of hostility to the press  and perhaps the willingness to limit or punish press criticism may reach a new height in this administration  although abrams mentioned that this would be a first for american journalists  maybe it s time that changed  the press is used to defending libel cases  that s a good part to what i ve done in my career  so as to protect free speech and free expression as much as possible  i m not seeking to move away from that  my plea is to bear in mind that one of the potential weapons is that when anyone president or shoemaker defames an entity  and speaks falsely and maliciously  one of the possible responses is to bring a libel suit  trump has spent days on twitter bashing the media and condemning journalists for speaking the truth about him  even after the election  trump has continued to criticize the media for doing its job  just days after winning the election  trump was back at it again  twitterfeatured image via joe raedle   getty images
