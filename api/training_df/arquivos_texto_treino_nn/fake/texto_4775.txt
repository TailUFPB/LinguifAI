a longtime republican consultant  carter wrenn  has finally said what the rest of the gop won t about voter id laws  in person voter fraud is an excuse  and the laws that force people to obtain certain identification  along with limiting or eliminating early voting and other provisions  wouldn t happen if the black community would just vote republican you can t make this up  wrenn told the washington post  look  if african americans voted overwhelmingly republican  they would have kept early voting right where it was  it wasn t about discriminating against african americans  they just ended up in the middle of it because they vote democrat  so it was about discriminating against african americans  how on earth does wrenn get from  if african americans voted overwhelmingly republican  to   this wasn t about discrimination   there s no way to make that leap of logic without an awful lot of crazy gymnastics basically  wrenn just admitted that republicans wouldn t push down the black community if the black community would just do what republicans want  republicans would probably be all for fixing inner cities  passing jobs bills  passing crime bills  ensuring the social safety net isn t gutted  and more  if the black community voted republican  but  since they don t  fuck  em  the gop has to protect its majorities  after all wake county  in north carolina  the state whose voter id law wrenn was discussing  says that more early voting would just waste tax dollars and cause additional chaos  excuses  excuses  and flimsy ones at that  all the county boards in north carolina are republican under state law because the governor is a republican  they re apparently all on his side with rationalizing away their blatant discrimination any way they can the supreme court refused to grant a stay on a lower court s decision that north carolina s law was crafted with the specific intent of suppressing the black vote  governor pat mccrory threw a livid fit  saying that the court had denied basic voting rights to north carolina that other states are allowed to enjoy it s really the state that s trying to deny basic voting rights to their black community  all in the name of  preventing voter fraud   and protecting  one person  one vote   mccrory has his lies all lined up in a neat little row  though  and will use them  one after the other  for as long as he has to the gop needs to clean its own house before they cry about voter fraud  their standard bearer s own campaign ceo is guilty of attempting voter fraud  which just makes them utter hypocrites for tolerating that and whining up a storm about the need to prevent voter fraud but don t call them racist  and don t call these laws racist  the gop has this strange need to convince itself that this isn t about racism  consider this  though  even if it truly wasn t about racism  they re still working to actively deny people their constitutional right to vote  wrenn just damned his party with that interview featured image by mario tama getty images
