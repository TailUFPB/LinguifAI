when former president george w  bush left office  he remained quiet in regards to any criticism of barack obama  sure  dick cheney didn t  but obama s predecessor remained graceful in order to keep the peace  president obama didn t attack bush  either  trump s unprecedented attack by a sitting president on the former occupant of the white house has caused a firestorm off attention after calling obama sick  and suggested he should be criminally prosecuted for  wiretapping  him during the election campaign  trump did not offer any proof and the white house is scrambling to defend his jaw dropping claims which originated from the right wing fake news site breitbart  then was promptly circulated by fake news site gateway pundit so what does barack obama think of the new conspiracy theory about him  unlike trump  obama can take the heat with a simple eye roll and shrug it off  obama didn t take to his twitter account to unleash mean girl tweets about donald trump a source who spoke to nbc news said that former president barack obama  rolled his eyes  at trump s unsubstantiated claims that he wiretapped trump tower toward the end of the  election this his how a real president reacts to a  year old s twitter tantrum the source  who spoke to nbc news on the condition of anonymity and is familiar with the president s thinking  said obama believes the claims  undermine the integrity of the office of the president   but don t undermine his own integrity  because  he didn t do it  the source added that obama  is much more concerned by president trump kicking people off their health insurance  not staffing the government  not being prepared for a crisis  rolling back regulations so that corporations can pollute the air and water and letting mentally unstable people buy guns with no problems whatsoever  he cares about all those things much more than what president trump tweets at the tv each morning   the source continued the white house has stated that alleged president donald trump supports a congressional investigation into  whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in   as part of a larger investigation into the russian hacking scandal so  obama is more concerned about our country s well being than over some crotchety old man s rantings on twitter even though trump has again created another conspiracy about his predecessor seriously  trump supporters  you never knew what you had until it was gone  sort of like obamacare which is being replaced by trumpcare karmacare photo by zach gibson getty images
