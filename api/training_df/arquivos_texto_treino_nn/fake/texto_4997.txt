a pawn working for donald trump claimed that women respect and are voting for the republican nominee in november  and s e  cupp took her to the woodshed for it during a panel discussion on cnn with carol costello  cupp began by explaining the stark reality that the only voters trump can count on right now are old white men  which is not nearly enough to catapult him to victory over hillary clinton  there s no outreach anymore   cupp said   it s as if he s given up on them  and i just wonder if there are enough old male guy  old white guys in the country to elect him  i don t think so  but trump supporter tana goertz  who appeared on the donald s reality show the apprentice  made the absurd claim that not only is trump s campaign reaching out to women but that the effort is succeeding  how   cupp asked   no you re not  actually you re not   she continued   there s math  there s polls  indeed  polls show trump is getting destroyed by hillary clinton right now and women are leading the way  over  percent of women view trump unfavorably and if the election were held today hillary would win a higher percentage of women than president obama did in  but goertz continued to pretend that their effort is working  citing her role in the campaign as proof  oh  really  oh  i m sorry  i m on the campaign and i m actually part of the women s initiative  so that s weird   goretz said  which drew a truthful jab from cupp  there s polls that show you re not reaching women  that s just math  i m sorry to break it to you  costello jumped in and asked goertz for specifics on how trump is reaching out to women  and her answer left a lot to be desired  the answer to that is he is having people like myself  his lovely daughter ivanka  other strong republican leaders  hold leadership conferences where we are getting out in front of large audiences of women who would like to hear why women like myself  why women like ivanka  why other wonderful strong independent women who are making their own living  who are successful  who are highly educated  are voting and respect and are working for donald trump  in short  goertz could only name herself and trump s daughter as examples of women who support donald trump  and cupp was quick to jump all over her for it  that s what we call anecdotal evidence  that s anecdotal and of course  there s some women supporting donald trump  that s a fact  but to ignore the fact that  percent of women do not like donald trump and that he has a huge gap between him and hillary clinton among women voters is a fantasy land  here s the video via youtube trump s campaign is still in denial that they are getting their asses handed to them in the polls  and the fact that trump and his supporters are so delusional that they really believe women are coming around to supporting him is further proof that trump s campaign lives in the  fantasy land  cupp mentioned featured image via screen capture
