donald trump supporters who struggle to earn a paycheck continue to get screwed over and bernie sanders called trump out for it on sunday on friday  trump met with wall street bankers and promised that he will gut dodd frank regulations that prevent them from screwing over their customers  specifically  trump admitted that he is only interested in helping his rich friends instead of sticking to his promise to help the working class americans who voted for him  we expect to be cutting a lot out of dodd frank  because frankly i have so many people  friends of mine  that have nice businesses and they can t borrow money  they just can t get any money because the banks just won t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in dodd frank  so we ll be talking about that in terms of the banking industry  furthermore  trump has stacked his administration with former goldman sachs employees despite criticizing hillary clinton throughout his campaign for her ties to the big wall street bank on sunday  senator bernie sanders did not mince words as he called out trump for being a fraud  it is hard not to laugh to see president trump alongside these wall street guys   sanders said on cnn with jake tapper   i have to say this  jake  and i don t mean to be disrespectful  this guy is a fraud  sander s reminded tapper and viewers that trump ran his campaign by promising to fight wall street  this guy ran for president of the united states and said   i  donald trump  i m going to take on wall street  these guys are getting away with murder   and then suddenly he appoints all these wall street billionaires  his major financial adviser comes from goldman sachs and now he s going to dismantle legislation that protects consumers  indeed  trump claimed during his campaign that he would be tough on wall street and would seek to restore laws that were passed after the great depression  like glass steagall  that placed regulations on the financial sector designed to prevent the kind of banking practices that caused it in the first place and would also cause the great recession in  sanders also slammed trump for appointing people who want to destroy medicare and social security despite promising that he would protect both programs  this is a guy who ran for president  saying   i m not going to cut social security  medicare and medicaid   sanders said   and then he appoints all of these guys who are precisely going to cut social security  medicare and medicaid  in the end  while sanders conceded that trump put on a good show to dupe voters   i think he s going to sell out the middle class and the working class of this country  here s the video via youtube donald trump does not care about the american people  he only cares about himself and his wealthy buddies  he s a hypocrite for palling around with goldman sachs executives and is a liar for making promises to his middle class supporters that he clearly had absolutely no intention of keeping  how many times do his supporters need to get duped before they turn against him featured image via flickr flickr
