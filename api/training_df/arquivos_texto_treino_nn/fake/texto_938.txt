the republican effort to impeach former president bill clinton is coming back to haunt them back in   republicans passed articles of impeachment against clinton for lying under oath about an extramarital affair with monica lewinsky  seriously  they really sought to impeach a sitting president for this fast forward to  and america has been suffering through the donald trump circus for six months  he has lied to the american people just about every time he speaks  he launches vicious attacks on the media and individuals  he is actively trying to kill an investigation into his ties with russia that could reveal collusion during the  election  committing obstruction of justice along the way  he has violated the constitution more time than we can count yet republicans in this congress have absolutely no problem with trump abusing his power and acting like a petulant child if bill clinton or barack obama had done these things  republicans would have impeached both of them without thinking twice  and they would have successfully ousted them former republican congressman bob inglis voted to impeach clinton nearly  years ago  and now he admits that what trump is doing is far worse than what republicans tried to impeach clinton for during a  interview  inglis explained his vote by saying that president s need to have moral authority to lead  there are issues around the world that require american leadership   he said   the leader of the free world needs moral authority  and we ve got a president who is sorely lacking in that regard  cnn international host christiane amanpour reminded inglis of his words on monday and he was quick to apply them to the present day  well  i guess that young guy you were just playing there apparently hadn t seen something called the donald trump show because this is much more serious than anything we ever accused bill clinton of   inglis declared  i mean  bill clinton was a problem involving perjury with the underlying matter being a sexual affair  this is something quite different  particularly when it gets into the russia investigation and the firing of james comey  these are very serious matters  inglis also has a problem with trump s involvement with russia  his withdrawal of united states participation in the paris climate accords  and trump  sidelining  america in the area of global leadership here s the video via twitter he voted to impeach clinton   bobinglis now says he  apparently hadn t seen something called the donald trump show   https   t co   christiane amanpour   camanpour  july    trump should be impeached  his behavior has embarrassed the united states around the world and he has demonstrated clearly that he is unfit to hold office  if a simple extramarital affair and one lie is enough for republicans to impeach a president  trump should have been ousted on the first day  republicans need to stop being hypocrites and do the right thing featured image  alex wong getty images
