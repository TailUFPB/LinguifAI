september  was arguably the worst day in american history  all americans were shell shocked  fearful  and lost in grief and confusion well  almost all americans were grief stricken  except of course donald trump  in his typical form  trump used an unimaginable horror to prop himself up and pat himself on the back as the world trade center collapsed to the ground  trump  in a by phone t v  interview  boasted that his building   wall street  was now the tallest building in lower manhattan reporter  you have one of the landmark buildings down in the financial district there   wall street   uh   did you have any damage  what s happened down there trump  oh  it s an amazing phone call i made   wall street actually was the second tallest building in downtown manhattan and it was actually before the world trade center was the tallest  and when they built the world trade center it became known as the second tallest  but now it s the tallest congratulations  trump  as thousands of people lie dead in a mast of rubble and debris  you single handedly turn a national tragedy into praise for yourself and your buildings imagine if hillary clinton  who was senator of new york at the time  had said something so incredibly offensive  so devoid of sympathy or empathy for new yorkers of course his supporters   republicans who exploit   to draw out our fears   will dismiss this as another liberal character assault  coupled with his lies about muslims  the theft of his  charity  for   survivors  it should come as no surprise that donald trump did not care on iota about what happened only a egomaniacal narcissist would take the opportunity to plug in his business as being the biggest  and thus the best  as an iconic hallmark of the world crumbles watch the exchange for yourself and share it with all your  patriotic  trump supporting friends and family  show them how hereally felt on   there s audio of trump patting himself on the back for having the tallest building in manhattan after the wtc fell  pic twitter com vqffcaibqz  josh jordan   numbersmuncher  september    s your candidate  republicans  in all his glory featured image via spencer platt getty images
