randy bryce  known as  ironstache on twitter  launched a campaign to oust paul ryan from wisconsin s  district  bryce is a union ironworker who has been campaigning for all of one day  and he s already raised     that is a lot for a new face who s a democrat living in republican land and running in a district that s gone to paul ryan every two years since  bryce isn t just a union ironworker in republican land  wisconsin  though  he s an army veteran who enlisted right after high school  and then worked his way up to being an ironworker through apprenticeship  his mother suffers from multiple sclerosis  his father is in an assisted living facility  and randy himself is a cancer survivor  he s campaigning primarily on healthcare right now  and he says on his website  what paul ryan and the republicans are doing to take health care away from millions of us  to make it cost more and cover less  and to allow the protections we ve gained to be stripped away   it s just unacceptable  bryce has an uphill battle to fight  ryan is very well connected both in the  district and across america  however  bryce will work to tie ryan to donald trump as much as possible  working off democrats  hopes that the trump effect will help flip congress next year but it may not be that terrible a climg  paul ryan is already wildly unpopular around the country  with an approval rating below  percent  that could very well pull down his popularity in his own district  he s also starting to get a reputation for making every excuse in the book for trump  regarding obstruction of justice  ryan lamely claimed that trump is new and doesn t know what s appropriate and what s not when it comes to interacting with various agency heads  particularly those in the law enforcement and intelligence communities  ryan gave him a pass as though he s a little child navigating his way through the world for the first time he s also confident that trump will approve of the massively unpopular gop healthcare bill whatever form that ends up taking and once again blasted the aca while claiming that their bill is ever so much better ryan is almost inextricably linked to trump right now  and as trump s base shrinks  so will ryan s  what bryce is doing and clearly  what many are hoping he can do is taking advantage of the possibility that a hole will open up in the  district because of trump featured image via win mcnamee getty images
