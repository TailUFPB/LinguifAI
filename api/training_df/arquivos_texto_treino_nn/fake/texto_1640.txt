all week  team trump has been trying to push all the blame for michael flynn s actions onto the obama administration  despite the fact that flynn did not start working for foreign governments until after he was fired  they still think they can say it is all barack obama s fault  rob reiner is having none of it this morning on am joy  reiner said  this man who is the head of our country is a pathological liar and everybody around him is lying  there s no way to other way to look at this thing  not only did we know about michael flynn  there were a number of articles  there was a letter written by the house oversight committee  it was well known what michael flynn was doing  he was fired by barack obama  so that is clear  the one thing that they have been successful at so far is obfuscating the biggest single story that is permeating this country right now  and that is the invasion of a foreign power  a hostile foreign power into our democracy  and the michael flynn story  aside from the fact that he was taking money from turkey  from russia  from places and clearly that s a criminal behavior  the main part of the story  and something that we haven t even talked about is  why  why with the white house knowing full well that this is who he was  they still appointed him national security adviser  at first the gang that can t shoot straight looked like it was incompetent because they may not have bothered to do any vetting of flynn before letting him take over as the national security advisor  now it looks like they either did not understand the law or the constitution and the rules the military needs to adhere to or they knew the rules and didn t care that flynn broke them  either way  putting flynn in such a sensitive post  with access to the most classified data  was never a good idea  while flynn was getting the same briefing as the president elect  he penned an op ed for the hill urging more support for turkey  when that piece was written  flynn was receiving money from the turkish government featured image via amanda edwards getty images
