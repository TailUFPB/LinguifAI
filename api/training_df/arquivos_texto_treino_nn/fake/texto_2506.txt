as trump prepares to kick off his  campaign so he can avoid doing real work in the white house  a new poll has devastating news for him  if the  election were held tomorrow  a generic  unnamed democrat would beat him  that means that more people would vote for pretty much any democrat in order to keep trump from being re elected the politico morning consult poll has  percent of respondents saying they would probably pick the democrat even without a name right now  only  percent said they would vote for trump worse  the number of trump voters who would vote for him again is slipping   percent of trump voters said they d vote for him again  compared to  percent of hillary s voters who would vote for the generic democrat and perhaps even worse than that is the fact that  percent of people who answered this poll believe trump is the worst president we ve had since wwii   percent hold that same opinion of obama  but trump s presidency is all of one month old  obama served his eight years and has a legacy for people to look at it s really not often that people believe history will view a president that badly just thirty days into his first term for trump  where his image and ego are everything  the idea that people would rather support a generic someone over him has got to be horrifying  this is a poll he would probably call  fake news   because of the people who line the streets outside mar a lago  who are protesters   and all the electoral votes he won  and so on add all of this to the fact that he really is planning a campaign event in florida for this weekend  and has declared himself eligible for candidacy for  already  and what it shows right now is that people believe he can t do the job  presidents often enjoy a certain  honeymoon  period with both the press and the populace following their election  trump has been screwing up so badly so quickly that his honeymoon didn t even happen the only people who still think he s doing a good job are his most ardent supporters  but those people would support him even if he nuked the u s  back into the stone age featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
