arizona senator john mccain has never been a fan of donald trump  we all remember how he viciously attacked mccain s military service  when mccain was imprisoned and tortured during the vietnam war while trump got multiple military deferments  also  mccain is often openly critical of trump  and he was the final gop senator to sink the so called  skinny repeal  of the affordable care act  to put it delicately  there is no love lost between the two men now  it seems that mccain  who is battling brain cancer is really speaking his mind  no matter who would criticize him for doing so  this time  his target is to expose the real feelings of capitol hill republicans when it comes to donald trump  mccain said in an interview to the new york times regarding trump s reelection chances  they see weakness in this president  look  it s not a nice business we re in  mccain then went on to rip the chaos of the trump white house  and particularly the effect their incompetence is having on national security  i urge the president to resolve the differences within his administration as soon as possible and decide on a policy and strategy that can achieve our national security interests in afghanistan and the region  the thing is  traditional republicans never wanted donald trump to be their nominee or their president  they knew  like anyone else watching  that he was woefully unfit to be president of the united states  however  instead of putting their country before their party  they propped trump up anyway  and their fear of his voters will not allow them to speak out  or to do anything about him however  john mccain is such a towering  respected figure in the united states senate that it s clear he just doesn t give a damn  he ll say what he thinks about trump   and will expose the cowardice of those within his own party in their refusal to do so on their own featured image via win mcnamee getty images
