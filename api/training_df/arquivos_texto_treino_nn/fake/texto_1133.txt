on trump s birthday  the washington post published an explosive story alleging that the fbi under mueller s direction was currently investigating trump for obstruction of justice for his treatment of former fbi director james comey the special counsel overseeing the investigation into russia s role in the  election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether president trump attempted to obstruct justice  officials said the move by special counsel robert s  mueller iii to investigate trump s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year old fbi investigation  which until recently focused on russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the trump campaign and the kremlin  investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among trump associates  officials said trump has no one to blame for this new line of inquiry but himself  in testimony his staff hasn t even bothered denying  comey noted that trump once asked everyone to leave the room before directly asking the fbi director if he could find a way to drop the russia investigation  then trump fired comey when the investigation continued  then he went into an interview with nbc s lester holt and explicitly admitted that he fired comey because he wouldn t stop investigating his connections to russia rather than make his problems go away  firing comey and trump s subsequent confession seem to have triggered a new investigation   this time in his attempts to obstruct justice by interrupting the investigative process despite the avalanche of evidence against him  trump s team had a painfully predictable response  to accuse the washington post of lying  in the hours after publishing  trump staff and friends repeatedly claimed there was no investigation into trump  they screamed  fake news  the chairwoman of the rnc went further  claiming mueller had smeared trump with  unfounded accusations    hint  mueller hasn t even commented publicly yet  and an investigation isn t an  accusation   mueller s unfounded accusation against  potus changes nothing  there s still no proof of obstruction of justice  https   t co   ronna romneymcdaniel   gopchairwoman  june    trump woke up and promptly confirmed it was real they made up a phony collusion with the russians story  found zero proof  so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story  nice  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     they  here appears to be the investigators looking into trump  the  year old man throwing a temper tantrum on twitter seemed to reinforce that when his follow up tweet included an attack on the investigators themselves you are witnessing the single greatest witch hunt in american political history   led by some very bad and conflicted people   maga  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     conflicted  people was the tell  trump s teams latest attack on mueller   a pretext to firing him  some might say   is that he has a  conflict of interest  in the case  it s never clearly articulated what that conflict of interest is trump has repeatedly implicated himself in wrongdoing despite his staff s best efforts  in hushed tones  white house aides are telling reporters that they are furious with the president who they say is completely to blame for this endless investigation  trump may be really good at getting into trouble  but he is terrible at getting out of it in his rage and panic  he s managed to step on every rake in the yard  how long before he finds a way to say he is totally guilty in  characters or less featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
