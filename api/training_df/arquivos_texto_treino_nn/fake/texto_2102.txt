a lot about america has changed since the rise of donald trump  people thought that his coarse language  his clear racism and misogyny  and just generally appalling behavior would render him unacceptable to the american public  yet  here we are  donald trump is president  and his young administration has fundamentally changed how the world views america  its citizens  and its government  one thing that hasn t changed though is the way some strident and brave media personalities continue to speak truth to power and insist on making sure that trump s disgusting ways  his incompetence  and his lies don t fundamentally change who we are as a people  perhaps the breakout star in that regard is cnn s jake tapper tapper hosts the lead during the week  and state of the union on sunday mornings  on friday night  the fiery host stopped by hbo s real time to have a chat with host bill maher  of course  maher had to ask about the changes tapper has had to make now that there s the biggest liar on earth occupying the oval office  tapper responded  you ve been covering politicians for a long time  politicians lie  it wasn t invented on jan    i ve never seen this level of falsehood  quantitatively  tapper went on to distinguish between what happens with say  falsehoods that happened with the obama administration such as   if you like your doctor  you can keep your doctor   he says of the lies coming out of the trump white house  it s conspiracy theories based on nothing that have members of his own party distancing themselves from him  then the conversation turns to trump s vulgarity and other fundamental affronts to basic human decency in public discourse  tapper says of the way trump behaved on the campaign trail and how he continues to behave  the truth of the matter is that there is no bias when it comes to facts and there s no bias when it comes to decency  it s empirically indecent to make fun of the disabled  that s just indecent  my children know better than that  the two hosts then went on to reference what we all know   which is that most of the fundamental things that make trump so awful  we all learn not to do in grade school  maher says i always think about that book  everything i needed to know i learned in kindergarten   he violates every rule  don t lie  don t accuse people of things they re not guilty of  don t boast  pay your taxes  serve your country  don t be a racist  don t insult   like you say   the handicapped people or other people who are not as lucky to be as great looking as you are  donald  and yet  in spite of all of these things  people still voted for this fundamentally indecent  sorry excuse for a human being  that says things about this nation that we really need to examine  should we survive this nightmare of a  presidency  watch the video below featured image via scott eisen getty images
