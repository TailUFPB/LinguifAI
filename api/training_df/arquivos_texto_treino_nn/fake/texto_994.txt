former acting attorney general sally yates was fired by donald trump when she refused to defend his travel ban  which we all know is nothing more than a muslim ban  on tuesday  she explained to attendees at the aspen ideas festival in colorado why it was that she couldn t bring herself to argue that this bill wasn t based on religion  i came ultimately to the conclusion that our defending this travel ban would require me to send lawyers of the justice department to court to say this ban had nothing to do with religion    that  it was all based on national security  nothing to do with religion   yates told the audience  and i did not believe that to be a defense that was grounded in truth and i couldn t send department of justice lawyers in to defend something based on a defense that i did not believe was grounded in truth  the trump administration did not consult the justice department while crafting the ban and yates didn t even know about it until she got a call from her principal deputy who had read about it in the new york times  that was on a friday evening  she studied the bill as much as she could over the weekend and then convened a meeting with  lifetime civil department staffers  holdover employees from president obama s time in office and newly hired trump staff   her question to them was simple  how would you defend trump s travel ban  we went around the table with my asking them   all right  tell me why you think this is lawful  how are we going to defend this    yates said   without revealing our internal discussions here  at the end of that  i was not comfortable that it was  in fact  lawful or constitutional and kept the senior trump appointee back to tell him i was very uncomfortable where we were  after speaking to several other people about the muslim ban  yates said she just couldn t defend it  so  trump fired her like he fires anybody who doesn t kiss his a   and tell him that he can do no wrong  nevertheless  she persisted watch sally yates explain why she couldn t say trump s muslim ban was anything other than just that  a muslim ban  here    that s how we found out about it at  thejusticedept read abt it on the internet     sallyqyates talks  travelban pic twitter com xthwjhhulq  josh weinberger   kitson  june    image via video screen capture
