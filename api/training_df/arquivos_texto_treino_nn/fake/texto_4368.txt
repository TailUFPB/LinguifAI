a new report from realclearpolitics is detailing what might be another illegal endeavor of donald trump at the behest of his  charitable foundation   which has already been caught illegally using funds to pay off lawsuits  from  to   leading up to his presidential announcement  and speculation in    the trump foundation donated nearly    to various conservative groups and organizations irs laws clearly state that charity executives may not use a foundation  funds to finance personal endeavors that benefit said executives in   trump met with south carolina conservative activist oran smith with the intent for  as smith puts it   laying the foundation for a   campaign   after the meeting between the two  trump  using foundation money  donated    to smith s organization  the palmetto family council according to realclearpolitics in many cases  this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible republican candidate for president  although sources familiar with the thinking behind the donations cautioned that trump did not explicitly ask for favors in return for the money  they said the contributions were part of a deliberate effort by trump to ingratiate himself with influential conservatives and brighten his political prospects talk about real pay for play using foundation money to monetarily influence  even slightly  those who could  and would  catapult his political career  a personal endeavor  is still illegal under irs laws   no matter how many technicalities trump and his lawyers want to argue in almost all instances  these conservative organizations  with considerable political influence  invited the billionaire mogul and provided endorsements after he donated thousands of dollars to their cause another high profile donation was made to the family leader organization  a socially conservative think tank that featured trump as a keynote speaker at one of their most prestigious events in   trump was featured as the keynote speaker after giving    like he did with the palmetto family council  realclearpolitics points out that trump may have broken irs rules by giving directly to the organization and not its affiliated nonprofit branch  thus pitting trump in a  double whammy  on unethical  illegal political meanderings after trump donated    to citizens united  a koch backed political entity in april   when citizens united hosted a  cattle call  of would be republican candidates for president in new hampshire  trump was there  in january   at citizens united s freedom summit in iowa  trump was again on the program this won t bode well  especially for a guy who s  under audit  from the irs  we now know why  apparently while republicans try to find something  anything  to pit clinton against her foundation  the gop is ignoring the obvious abuses of trump and his  this double standard from the right should not surprise anyone   their candidate is failing and they need to divert any negative attention away from him  this is the party of  christian values  at work featured image via spencer platt getty images
