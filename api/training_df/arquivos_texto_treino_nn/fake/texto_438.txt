donald trump s decision to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  daca  is so toxic that even one of his most hardcore conservative republican supporters in the senate opposes it it s safe to say that oklahoma senator james lankford is one of trump s most ardent supporters  after all  lankford votes with trump s position nearly  percent of the time  and he backed trump during the  election but lankford is breaking with trump when it comes to killing daca daca was put in place by president obama to help children who were brought to the united states by their parents  america is where they grew up and it is the only home they have ever really known  daca was created to give them a path to citizenship and over   have applied deporting these people is heartless  especially since they would be deported to countries they have never really lived in trump s decision to end daca has been criticized by republicans and democrats alike  and has drawn outrage from the american people  trump s racist supporters  of course  support his decision but some republicans  like lankford  oppose it  it is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally   lankford said in a statement   however  we as americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents  we must confront the nation s out of date immigration policy and finally resolve the issues of strong border enforcement and merit immigration   lankford continued   policy reform must come from the american people through congress  the legislative and executive branch should put aside passivity and partisanship and finally modernize our immigration laws  that s nice  but if lankford really supports daca he will put his money where his mouth is and introduce a bill to enshrine it in law  anything less would reveal his statement to be a lie designed to save his own ass from the wrath of voters who oppose trump s decision trump intends to make an official announcement on tuesday  let s hope the outrage and opposition are enough to make him change his mind featured image via ron sachs   pool getty images
