most political campaigns prefer to spend the bulk of their money on ad buys  internal polling and other research  voting lists  campaign field offices  staff   you know  the stuff a campaign actually needs if it wants to succeed  however  it seems that trump s campaign doesn t care about any of that  not only do they not have a ground game to speak of  but they don t spend their money on anything substantial they re spending their money on hats and t shirts and signs but lots and lots of hats   promotional merchandise that doesn t really do anything to further trump s campaign beyond his very tired slogan   make america great again  the washington post conducted an analysis of trump s final campaign finance filing with the federal election commission  they found the campaign has spent    million on polling over the last sixteen months  but they spent    million on hats  because clearly  those hats are the most important part of the campaign and nobody else gets that or so you d think with how trump loves to look like a tool wearing those hats at his rallies trump keeps touting his business prowess as what makes him so eminently qualified to run this country  because reasons  his campaign is running more like a business that thinks spending its money on endless advertising and promotional materials is better than  well  spending money actually running the company  or in this case  a presidential campaign  all told  trump s campaign has spent more on hats than it has on payroll  in fact  there are allegations going around that trump is refusing to pay a lot of his campaign staff  the post s analysis found that the amount of money trump has spent on hats is nearly three times what they ve spent on payroll  that could be why they act like they can t afford to pay their staff which is just sickening add to that the fact that his hats  and other merchandise  are made in china  presumably to cut down on costs  and you have to wonder just how many hats they ve bought and how much they ve earned back featured image by mark wallheiser via getty images
