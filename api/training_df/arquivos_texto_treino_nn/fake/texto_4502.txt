it s no secret that russia is very pro donald trump  and donald trump is extremely pro russia  his policies align with russia s christmas list  and he hired   for a campaign manager   a man who benefited heavily from pro russian monies during the ukrainian conflict  in fact  the ties between paul manafort and russian oligarchs became so widely known that it caused his premature departure from the campaign  prompting many questions to be raised the trump campaign thought this would all be behind them in no time but  as usual  they were wrong on friday  it was a announced that u s  intelligence officials are investigating carter page  a foreign policy adviser to trump  for alleged ties to russia  intelligence officials have reason to believe that page has opened up secret and backroom communications with top russian officials in an ongoing effort to have economic sanctions lifted according to yahoo news  which first broke the story the activities of trump adviser carter page  who has extensive business interests in russia  have been discussed with senior members of congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by moscow to influence the presidential election  the sources said  after one of those briefings  senate minority leader harry reid wrote fbi director james comey  citing reports of meetings between a trump adviser  a reference to page  and  high ranking sanctioned individuals  in moscow over the summer as evidence of  significant and disturbing ties  between the trump campaign and the kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau the reports apparently had some members of congress  taken aback   due to the overwhelming and disturbing evidence that shows these ties  congressional members  which includes california democrat dianne feinstein  fear that such ties could lead to an unfair tampering with not only u s  russian relations  but undercut foreign policy and even the november presidential election page is a former banker who worked for merrill lynch and is based in moscow  giving him strong ties with rich and influential russian officials  in fact  one of page s business buddies is especially problematic for american diplomacy and international law but u s  officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three day trip  page met with igor sechin  a longtime putin associate and former russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of rosneft  russian s leading oil company  a well placed western intelligence source tells yahoo news  that meeting  if confirmed  is viewed as especially problematic by u s  officials because the treasury department in august  named sechin to a list of russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over russia s  illegitimate and unlawful actions in the ukraine so now that that the trump campaign is once again under the microscope for shady russian ties  they did what they know best  they lied  page has been listed as a foreign policy adviser to trump since march  in august  hope hicks  spokeswoman for the campaign  confirmed that carter was an adviser  now  communications director jason miller told the hill that page is  not an adviser and has made no contribution to the campaign  so which is it  the campaign and its spokeswoman have confirmed that page is in fact an adviser  and now their communications director says he s not nor has he ever been it s becoming clearer and clearer everyday that the trump campaign is nothing more than a puppet of the kremlin and putin s rich  thuggish buddies  but no  let s continue to talk about hillary clinton s pneumonia  because that s way more important than a potentially stolen election by the same people supporting one of the candidates featured image via mark makaela getty images
