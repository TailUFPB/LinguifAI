sen  richard blumenthal laid all his cards on the table when it comes to donald trump s supreme court nominee  neil gorsuch  the democratic senator from connecticut argued that with the  looming  constitutional crisis facing the country and the growing likelihood that trump will be impeached  gorsuch should be filibustered speaking from the senate floor on monday  blumenthal said that after deliberating carefully and deeply   he has decided to vote against gorsuch  he said that although he still harbors resentment over the way republicans treated former president obama s scotus nominee  merrick garland  that isn t why he will be voting no on gorsuch  but my vote is not about merrick garland  it is about neil gorsuch and it is about the constitutional crisis that may well be looming as a potential threat to our democracy  blumenthal noted the testimony of fbi director james comey  reminding his fellow senators that trump is being investigated for possibly colluding with russia to interfere with the  election  this  he explained  makes the supreme court more important than ever  the independence of our judicial branch has never been more threatened or more important  the possibility of a supreme court needing to enforce a subpoena against the president of the united states is far from idle speculation  it has happened before in united states vs  nixon  president trump has launched a campaign of vicious and relentless attacks on the credibility of our judiciary  his disparaging comments have attempted to shake the foundations of respect for judicial rulings  the credibility and trust that is so essential to our supreme court and all our courts  and it is a respect that is vital to holding the president himself accountable to the people and our constitution the senator added that trump had promised a  litmus test   for whatever nominee he chose and as an  acolyte of hard right special interests   gorsuch definitely fits the bill  because of this  and gorsuch s evasion of questions regarding civil rights  blumenthal said he can be expected to attack abortion rights and same sex marriage  among other things  all reasons he needs to be kept as far away from the bench of the supreme court as possible you can watch blumenthal explain why he will be voting no on gorsuch  here featured image via drew angerer getty images
