things just keep getting worse for donald trump jr  with the word  treason  floating around on both the left and right  the last thing he needs is more inconvenient facts coming out about his meeting with a russian lawyer past what we already know  fortunately for him  he had the foresight to hire a criminal defense lawyer before the other shoe dropped speaking of shoes dropping  new information has come out about that meeting  not only did he go there with the intent of getting information about hillary clinton from the russians  trump jr  was informed beforehand that the material was part of the russian government s effort to help install his dad in the oval office the new york times reports the email to the younger mr  trump was sent by rob goldstone  a publicist and former british tabloid reporter who helped broker the june  meeting  in a statement on sunday  mr  trump acknowledged that he was interested in receiving damaging information about mrs  clinton  but gave no indication that he thought the lawyer might have been a kremlin proxy mr  goldstone s message  as described to the new york times by the three people  indicates that the russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information  it does not elaborate on the wider effort by moscow to help the trump campaign  there is no evidence to suggest that the promised damaging information was related to russian government computer hacking that led to the release of thousands of democratic national committee emails according to trump jr   the meeting did not amount to much  for his light treason  he says  he received no information and they just chatted about an adoption program  yes  that s what he s going with  the adoption program in question was halted by vladimir putin in response to the magnitsky act  a u s  law that blacklists russian human rights abusers  putin became so incensed that he decided american families may not adopt russian children  the new york times notes that trump jr  ended the meeting when the adoption program was brought up the meeting was also attended by former trump campaign manager paul manafort and ivanka trump s husband  jared kushner   a lot of people for an innocent meeting about a russian adoption program  but just the right amount for a little bit of treason no inconsistency in statements  meeting ended up being primarily about adoptions  in response to further q s i simply provided more details  https   t co   donald trump jr    donaldjtrumpjr  july    be clear  the meeting was not about adoption  though it was discussed   nor was it supposed to be  the meeting was about the russian government delivering damaging information about trump s political opponents to his lackeys trump jr  was told this beforehand  he  went  anyway  his intent was to work with the russian government against the united states  against our election  and for vladimir putin  there is no other way to describe what happened it  is  treason featured image via getty images
