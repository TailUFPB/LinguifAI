bill o reilly can always be trusted to be a total ass  especially when it comes to anything that runs counter to his myopic worldview  the women s marches  which took place all over the world and included three million women here at home  seem to be his latest target  in a conversation with charles krauthammer  o reilly went completely off the rails and actually compared the marches to totalitarianism as krauthammer talked about the real people who showed up to the women s march on washington  he obviously touched a nerve with o reilly  who thinks women don t do anything unless they re told to  don t you feel they showed up because they were told to show up  if you look at the totalitarian governments in the  century  krauthammer  despite having his own bizarre view of the marches  seemed incredulous  he tried to interrupt with   you re told to show up  who tells anybody to show up in this country  it s important to note that krauthammer is not exactly the most liberal of pundits  yet o reilly really floored him with this  krauthammer did bring up a good point  when people do what they re told  it s because there will be negative consequences if they don t  o reilly decided to try and explain what the consequences are  and he fell flat on his face  well  they have to go   they don t have to go through a negative  they have to go to be with her brothers and sisters  and to show their solidarity and that they are good people and fight the fascist racists  i mean  it s a whip up  and if you study history  all the totalitarian regimes were fueled by whip ups  okay  really  it s not possible that anybody went because they had something to say  nobody went because they were told to or because they were afraid of bad things should they not go  women went because they had something to say and if anybody s totalitarian here  it s the massive cheeto living in the white house now  o reilly is being just as stupid as ever with this and krauthammer can t really believe it  watch below featured image via screen capture
