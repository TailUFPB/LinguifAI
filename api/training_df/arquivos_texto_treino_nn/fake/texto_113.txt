it s been more than  years  but anyone who was alive at the time will remember when they first heard the news that eric david harris    and dylan bennet klebold    two students from columbine high school in littleton  colorado  had shot and killed  of their fellow students  plus one teacher and wounded  additional people  before turning their guns on themselves in the school s library on that fateful morning of april     the pair were also packing almost  explosives in what usa today described as a  suicidal attack  planned as a grand if badly implemented terrorist bombing  at the time it was almost impossible to conceive a greater tragedy  two lonely teenage outcasts feeling the need to take so many innocent young lives on just a regular day at school  sure  there had been other mass shootings of a greater scale  but columbine is still the worst us high school shooting on record  was the second worst mass shooting on any school campus at the time behind the  university of texas massacre  and the fifth worst mass shooting on us soil fast forward less than two decades later and the murder spree at columbine high school no longer even cracks the top  when it comes to the worst single day mass shootings in modern us history  what makes the statistics even more terrifying is that the five worst mass shootings in the united states and six of the top   have all occurred in the last  years  to make matters worse  three of the top  were in the past  months here are the  worst single day mass shootings in modern us history  counting victims only  in each instance  the shooter s death has been omitted which brings us to eric harris  dylan klebold  and the columbine high school massacre  to many  that is one of the worst tragedies the human mind can conjure up   just a couple of misunderstood teenagers who sought the justice of who they saw as their transgressors by running riot on their school and shooting at anyone in their path  resulting in  deaths  before killing themselves  this incident is no longer one of the  worst mass shootings in modern us history  but something needs to be done before it drops any lower featured image via screenshot
