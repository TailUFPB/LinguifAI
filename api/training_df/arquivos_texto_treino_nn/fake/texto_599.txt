by now  everyone is aware of how donald trump s openly white supremacist campaign and subsequent  presidency  has mainstreamed the most extreme of the fringe right wing  despite this fact  though  these people are hardly popular  therefore  it should come as no surprise that as these freaks are holding what is sure to be one of their biggest rallies in a really long time   likely more than ten years     they are desperate to make sure it s a hit  how are they planning to do this  by making it  quote   sexy   in bigoted alt right language  though  that simply means   no fat people allowed  one of the organizers of the white supremacist  unite the right  rally that is to take place in charlottesville  virginia  andrew anglin  is the piece of sh t who runs the white supremacist internet hole the daily stormer  he said  via a blog post  that he expects his fellow neo nazis to be  sexy   and that they  have to go to the gym   anglin goes on to sternly warn against baggy clothes and other typical  fat  attire  the worst look ever is a baggy t shirt  wear fitted t shirts  where the sleeve goes to the middle of your bicep  it should not hang lower than base of your member  anglin then models an outfit in some sort of store mirror  with the following description of how his members should present themselves  jean  should also be fitted  not tight  just fitted  in the photo those are actually shorts   i would not wear pants that loose fitting  and that s another thing  don t ever wear shorts  serious men in serious situations are not wearing shorts americans have an obsession with this baggy stuff  and it always looks bad  no matter what  it looks bad  even if everyone else is doing it  and in case his readers didn t get it the first couple of times  anglin then goes all in  saying fat people should be allowed to join groups and be involved in rallies  but we need to create a culture where we don t necessarily shame people  but do look at them and expect them to get it together  we should help people get it together  i m working on my biggest diet guide ever  which i think will help the overweight and skinny alike  even if they ve minimal time for exercise continued obesity should not be tolerated surely  a lot of our target demographic is going to be out of shape  which is why we need a culture of fitness  people should go to the gym together  help each other with diet do not look scraggly  i won t tell you how to cut your hair  but i do believe men s hair looks better short  and beards look better well trimmed on top of this  anglin reveals himself to be extremely misogynistic  and insists that women be shunted to the side  he also says that he  himself  has  quote   problems with women   he does want to be appealing to the fairer sex  though  and wants his rank and file white supremacists to be the same look good it is very important to look good we must have chad nationalism  that is what will make guys want to join us  that is what will make girls want to be our groupies  that will make us look like bad boys and heroes  that is what we are going for here i cannot stress the point hard enough   i m hitting italics again   we need to be extremely conscious of what we look like  and how we present ourselves  that matters more than our ideas  if that is sad to you  i m sorry  but that is just human nature  if people see a bunch of mismatched overweight slobs  they are not going to care what they are saying  of course  anglin and his disgusting cohorts will use the promise of hot women as a way to drag people into their despicable ideology this is all an obvious and explicit message of    no fatties allowed  you make us look bad   then again  it makes sense  people like anglin and another prominent alt right leader  richard spencer  are trying to rebrand the extreme  bigoted right  they cannot do that if they associate themselves with uneducated  fat  toothless  trailer park dwellers who most people think of when they think of the racist right it doesn t make it right  and all of what they are doing and what they are about is as wrong as it comes  however  it seems that for a so called  movement  that is still very unpopular and disgraceful even in many gop circles  they d be trying to get all the numbers they can  no matter what the people attending look like then again  these people are white supremacists  and there is nothing rational about them or anything they do featured image via facebook
