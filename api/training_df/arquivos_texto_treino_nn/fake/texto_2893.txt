donald trump just promised corporate america that they ll be able to rape the environment and screw over their workers at will after his administration is done killing every regulation in the book during a meeting with corporate executives on monday  trump told them that he will cut their tax rate  massively  by up to more than half the current rate of  percent  which would significantly reduce revenues the federal government will take in in short  that means trump is copying what republicans did in kansas  a move that has destroyed the state s economy while blowing up the budget with massive deficits trump also said that if a corporation wants to build a factory his team will expedite the process to make sure it happens even if doing so threatens vital habitats he then stated his intention to wipe out   percent or more  of the current regulations that protect workers and the environment  the regulations are going to be cut massively   trump said   and the taxes are going to be cut way down  but he insisted that workers and the environment will somehow still be protected despite the loss of the regulations that actually do protect them here s the video via facebook donald trump just became even more of a threat to workers  the environment  and the nation s fiscal health most of these regulations exist for a reason and we should not just be cutting because trump heard a sob story from a greedy corporate ceo but he s apparently going to do it anyway and that means american workers can expect to see regulations that protect their safety  wages  and rights disappear and then when they get home they ll have to deal with the dirty air and poisoned water that results from trump s repel of environmental regulations every voter who sat home pouting or voted for a third party because hillary clinton was the democratic nominee should be ashamed of themselves  because in the end  while trump is going to be responsible for our nation s destruction  you are to blame for enabling him to do so in the first place featured image  screenshot
