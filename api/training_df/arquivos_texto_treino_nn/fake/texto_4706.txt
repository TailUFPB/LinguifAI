msnbc host asked one final question during an interview with rudy guiliani on thursday and his answer caused matthews to take the former mayor to the woodshed for years  donald trump has been outright accusing president obama of not being born in the united states  then president obama released his birth certificate to the public and thoroughly humiliated the businessman and now that trump is the republican nominee  his birtherism is coming back to bit him in the ass as he has repeatedly been asked if he still believes president obama was born in kenya so far  trump has refused to talk about it and is hoping the media will just forget about the whole thing  but chris matthews had other ideas on thursday as he cornered rudy guiliani about it matthews pointed out that mike pence and ben carson have both broken with donald trump to confirm that president obama is the legitimately elected commander in chief of the united states guiliani claimed that he also believes that and said that donald trump believes that as well  but matthews didn t buy it because trump has avoided talking about it and has not publicly admitted that president obama was born in america  when did he do that   matthews demanded to know guiliani claimed trump said it a few years ago  but that was news to matthews  who continued to grill guiliani about it guiliani then tried to blame hillary clinton for the birther movement  but matthews quickly shut that lie down and made guiliani squirm  when is he gonna say that this president is legitimate   matthews repeated   this is a fundamental question  mister mayor  is the president of the united states legitimate of not  guiliani continued to try and cover trump s ass  but matthews was not having any of it  can you commit to your candidate saying in the next  hours that president barack obama s a legitimate president   matthews asked   can you commit for him that he will say that  but guiliani couldn t even do that and ended up desperately trying to change the subject to hillary clinton here s the video via youtube guiliani got his ass handed to him in this interview and that makes it very clear that donald trump needs to eat some crow and admit that president obama is a legitimate president and reject birtherism once and for all featured image  screenshot
