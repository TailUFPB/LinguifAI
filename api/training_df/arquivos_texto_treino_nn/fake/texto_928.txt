donald trump has been notorious for touting poll numbers that look good for him  during the campaign  whenever he d careen into one of his many controversies and the numbers dipped  he and his mouthpieces would reference junk polls to show that people still loved the donald  of course  any poll that can be voted in a million times online is bogus  however  factual data isn t bogus  and that data does not look good for trump right now  in fact  a new poll shows that way more americans want trump removed from office than the number of people who think he s doing a good job according to new data from public policy polling   percent of americans see donald trump as the incompetent  dangerously unstable buffoon he is  and want him impeached posthaste  on the other hand  just  percent believe he is actually a good president  that isn t surprising  after all  the slavish  blind devotion of his mouthbreathing base has not been a secret for nigh on two years now on the other side of said insane base  there were marches around the nation for the holiday weekend demanding trump s removal and protesting his administration and their policies  further  more democrats are becoming emboldened by these numbers and are actually drafting articles of impeachment  one such democrat is rep  brad sherman  d ca   speaking in his home district in los angeles  rep  sherman egged the anti trump crowd on  saying  we have to act now to protect our country from abuse of power and impulsive  ignorant incompetence  at this declaration  the crowd borrowed from trump s own base  and shouted back   lock him up  of course  there s one little difference between trump s base and the democrats   there s plenty of evidence to suggest that trump is a criminal  while there is absolutely none to suggest the same about hillary clinton of course  there will be no impeachment until the democrats take back the house of representatives  and there will be no invocation of the  amendment to remove and unfit  president  from office for the sake of the nation  therefore  we must turn out in   and make sure we control both chambers of congress  that s the only way we get real  credible congressional investigations into the russia ordeal  and it s the only way we get rid of trump and his criminal administration featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
