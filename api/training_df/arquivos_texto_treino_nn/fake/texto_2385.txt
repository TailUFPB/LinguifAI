immigration officials in florida proved how out of control things are in trump s america by detaining the son of muhammad ali because his name happens to sound too muslim for their liking muhammad ali jr  and his mother  khalilah camacho ali  were on their way home after speaking at a black history month event in montego bay  jamaica  on feb    they flew into fort lauderdale  florida  and then things took a disturbing turn chris mancini  a lawyer and friend of the family says they were pulled to the side as they were going through customs  khalilah camacho ali was released when she pulled out a photo of her with the legendary boxer  but muhammad ali jr  didn t have such a photo  apparently  being related to a famous person would have meant more to officials than the fact that he s an american citizen with a u s  passport to prove it ali jr  was held by immigration officials and questioned for almost two hours  where did you get your name from   they asked him over and over  when they asked him if he was a muslim  he said yes  and that really set off alarm bells for officials  they continued to question him about his religion and repeatedly asked him where he was born  just for the record  he was born in philadelphia in  usa today reports while ali jr  was detained  camacho ali ran around the airport asking   where s my son   and begging for help  according to mancini  because incidents involving customs officials are considered to be on federal soil  local police had no jurisdiction to help her  ali jr  was eventually released two hours later  and the family contacted mancini the following day they have both traveled all over the world and never  ever  have they been subjected to this kind of treatment  said mancini   to the ali family  it s crystal clear that this is directly linked to mr  trump s efforts to ban muslims from the united states   he added  imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion   he said   this is classic customs profiling  according to mancini  the ali family is debating whether or not to file a federal lawsuit and are searching for others who have been subjected to this kind of racial profiling and harassment featured image via andrew h  walker getty images for the michael j  fox foundation for parkinson s research
