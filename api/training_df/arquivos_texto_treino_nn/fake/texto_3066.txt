 may go down as the year that news died  at least in their souls  sure  it s been happening for a long time  but now  writing about donald trump s twitter wars has become more important than actual news and unfortunately  it takes a comedian to tell the truth seth meyers  in one of this best rants ever  criticized the media s constant coverage of trump s tweets  and in particular  the twitter war against meryl streep  calling them distractions from the real scandal  the russian hacking scandal  whether these tweets are calculated distractions or just the ramblings of an unhinged narcissist   meyers explained   it s clear trump would much rather talk about his feud with meryl streep than  say  the fact that intelligence officials believe russia hacked the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign to help trump win the election  source  slatehere s the entire video  definitely worth a listen while we can t know whether trump s childish twitter feed is a distraction or just the real  unfiltered donald trump  it doesn t matter  the fact is  it s serving as a distraction  trump and his handlers are pushing the news cycles into overdrive  leaving the media chasing the latest headline  which is way too often trump s latest tweets  rather than examining things of national importance if it weren t for the downfall of the mainstream media  you know  the same mainstream media that treated unfounded allegations against hillary clinton as if they held the same weight  or more  as the fact that donald trump has been accused of rape or that he didn t provide his tax returns or that he very clearly seems to be a puppet of russia  we likely wouldn t have a president elect donald trump  meyers is right  it s time the media does its job  too bad it will be left to the comedians featured image via video screen capture
