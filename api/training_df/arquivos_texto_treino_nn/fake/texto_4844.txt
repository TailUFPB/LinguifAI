marco rubio hates his job  last year  he said he wasn t going to run for reelection because he was  frustrated   he also had one of the worst attendance records in the senate  now  rubio wants his job back  but  as if his voters haven t been screwed enough from him  he won t promise he ll finish his term out in an interview tuesday  cnn s manu raju asked rubio if he would commit to serving the entirety of his term  to which the florida republican said  no one can make that commitment because you don t know what the future s gonna hold in your life   personally or politically  i can commit to you this   rubio said   that if i am running to be a u s  senator  i am fully prepared to allow the u s  senate to be the last political office i ever hold  source  independent journalhere s the video   mkraju to marco rubio  can you commit to serving a full  year term rubio   no one can make that commitment https   t co   joe perticone   joeperticone  august    s seat is important to both republicans and democrats  it could help turn the balance of power one way or another and despite rubio s horrible tenure and his ambivalence toward the office he s trying to hold  democrats are facing an uphill battle right now  two democrats are eyeing the senate in florida  former rep  alan grayson and rep  patrick murphy  it s expected that murphy  the more centrist of the two candidates  will win the nomination  but the election is another story  so far  rubio is handily winning in most polls  two show him within the margin of error this fact is kind of amazing  considering rubio has the absolute worst attendance record in the senate of course  that might actually play well with his anti government base  who would seemingly rather elect someone who s just a placeholder and an obstructionist  rather than someone who actually does his job for the people of florida  this is why this country can t have nice things   literally featured image via joe raedle getty images
