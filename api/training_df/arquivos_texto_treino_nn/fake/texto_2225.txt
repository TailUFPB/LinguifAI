someone is going to empty lots and cordoned off buildings around the country and putting signs on the fences around them  these aren t ordinary signs  either  they literally say   lot reserved for  future internment camp   they carry the presidential seal and donald trump s signature signs designating  future internment camp  go up at construction lots https   t co  pic twitter com   laist   laist  march    signs advertising  future internment camp  pop up at chicago sites https   t co  pic twitter com   chicagoist   chicagoist  march    art hits boston https   t co   erin tiernan   erintiernan  march    future internment camp  signs appear across america   a conversation with the  artist behind themhttps   t co    satiristas    satiristas  march    internment camp signs across the usa  a selection from ten us cities   immigration  immigrant  humanrights  racism  donaldtrump pic twitter com   plastic jesus   plasticjesusart  march    aren t real  yet   but they are a frightening reminder of just who we elected to the white house and what it is that trump is trying to do  they re the work of a street artist known as plastic jesus  who s previously focused most of his work on the entertainment industry  according to laist  though  these signs are something different  and not just because they re political  we re seeing detention of travelers to the u s  they have all the proper credentials  but they re being detained for the country they re coming from  as well as their race  i have a friend who was detained because her name was lebanese  she was detained for a couple hours and was questioned  this was someone who has a visa  lebanon isn t on trump s list  it s normal for u s  customs and border protection to briefly question foreign nationals from everywhere before granting them admission to the country  and it s true that we don t know all the specific circumstances surrounding these detentions  however  the amount of hours long detention for people who seem to otherwise check out  are traveling on the proper visa  have the rest of their travel documents and itineraries in order  etc   is alarming not only are people being unnecessarily  and even wrongly  delayed prior to entering the u s   but trump is working to ramp up deportation  including increasing funding for  detention beds   for immigrants awaiting deportation  to ramp up the deportation process the way trump wants could eventually require camps  since detention centers aren t big enough  probably won t be made big enough  and deporting someone isn t as simple as picking them up and driving them across the border the signs reference executive order   which is the order fdr signed to create the japanese internment camps we had during wwii  the idea of camps for immigrants  people who are prohibited from entering the u s  due to trump s new travel ban but can t be turned around immediately  and possibly more  is eerily evocative of that there s some backlash  but when art gets political like this  there will always be backlash  the idea is to stir people up and make them take notice of the events unfolding around them featured image by john moore via getty images
