last night  nbc hosted the commander in chief forum in new york  where host matt lauer questioned hillary and trump for  minutes each  actually he put the screws to hillary and lobbed puff balls at trump  but that s beside the point   hillary  as usual  was specific when answering questions  even those from veterans  trump  har de har har  his entire answer to every question boiled down to   i have a plan  and it will work  obama and hillary have screwed this up for you  but my plan will fix it  in fact  the following tweets actually show the difference between hillary and trump when it comes to anything to do with policy one striking contrast  how will you improve vets  mental health clinton  see my detailed plan  released last week trump  the va is corrupt  dan diamond   ddiamond  september    clinton  points to specific allies and her   word mental health plantrump  says he ll create something  great  to fix  corrupt  system  dan diamond   ddiamond  september    s pretty much all trump does  he makes grandiose but vague promises to take care of this  fix that  and more  and people believe him  he could say   the va is corrupt  trust me  i know corrupt enterprises  i can spot them a mile away  the va is definitely a corrupt enterprise  but i will fix it  we ll have the best veterans system in the world  the best  it ll be great   and they ll just eat it up without question that s why he s a demagogue meanwhile  we have hillary clinton in the other corner  who knows how to develop plans to handle things  and has actual  real ways to handle things  along with who will be enlisted to carry it out and or help  she provides the specifics on her plans that trump won t provide on his that s the main difference between them now  trump just says whatever he thinks people want to hear  and makes it vague enough that it ll be very easy for him to claim he never promised this  that or the other when  in fact  he did promise this  that or the other  hillary actually tells people what they can expect photo of hillary clinton by justin sullivan getty images  photo of donald trump by alex wong getty images
