for years  fox news hosts have been spewing racist remarks without consequences but apparently  when the racism is directed against their own african american employees  the conservative network draws a line fox has reportedly fired longtime comptroller judy slater for making racist comments to black employees after her behavior was brought to the attention of her bosses according to the wrap slater  who is white and has worked at fox for  years  was accused of asking one african american employee if all three of her children were fathered by the same man  according to an individual familiar with the matter  she also referred to african american women as  sista  and stereotyped african american employees  speech  openly complaining that they mispronounced words  the individual said in a statement  fox news condemned slater s  abhorrent behavior  and claimed that such behavior is not tolerated by the network  we take any complaint of this nature very seriously and took the appropriate action in investigating and firing ms  slater within two weeks of this being brought to our attention  there is no place for abhorrent behavior like this at fox news  of course  if fox news really takes racism seriously  they would oust personalities like sean hannity and bill o reilly  who have also made racist remarks over the years just last october  hannity literally offered to send president obama and his family back to africa even though president obama and his family are natural born citizens of the united states nobody would have ever said this to any of our presidents who served before obama  but hannity did and he should have been fired on the spot that same month  bill o reilly gave the green light to a segment featuring jesse watters mocking asian americans  the segment drew instant outrage and condemnation from multiple asian american organizations  however  o reilly is still on the air and watters was promoted o reilly and watters have often teamed up to reach new heights of racism  including a segment in  aimed at shaming homeless black people fox host jeanine pirro should also be fired for taking racism and hate to a new level  not only did she blame michelle obama for all the bad things that have happened in the world in a highly disrespectful rant  she told a black  hamilton  actor to shut up and stick to hip hop so while it s good to see fox news punishing racists in their ranks  they need to start cleaning house by firing the hosts who spew racism on the air  if fox news truly takes racism seriously  that s what they need to do
