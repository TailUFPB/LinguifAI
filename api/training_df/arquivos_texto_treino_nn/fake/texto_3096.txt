here s a news flash for donald trump  mexico won t be paying for his racist little wall   not now  not tomorrow  not six months from now  not ever  on friday  trump made himself the subject of mockery

paying for the wall and mexico will still not be paying for it later  but at least trump can get it built trump s team has made a number of wacky proposals related to paying for the wall  including amending the patriot act to include wire transfers as accounts that could be frozen and otherwise punishing mexico for their refusal to fund what could possibly be the most fiscally irresponsible undertaking since  well  any of the bazillion businesses trump has bankrupted  they have even discussed tying it to the appropriations process  which could force democrats to agree to funding to keep the government from shutting down   but  once again  don t worry  mexico will totally pay us back  dishonest media says mexico won t be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly   trump tweeted  once again attacking the   well  his followers seem very fond of the phrase  lugenpresse  or  lying press   he ended this rant with a phrase that certainly
