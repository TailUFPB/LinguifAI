republican senator rand paul spoke with cnn s erin burnett on tuesday and accidentally spilled the beans about the kind of healthcare american really needs  while explaining his position on the latest healthcare plan drummed up by the gop  he talked himself into a corner by describing a system of healthcare that sounds a lot like single payer paul was exchanging healthcare views with erin burnett when she realized that he accidentally made the point for nationalized healthcare  so she pressed him hard using his own words against him  we should try to give them options   he explained while making the case for individual markets  he used the example of a how a plumber could link up with additional plumbers and create one large group market that covers all cases  including things like pregnancy  you could get a way out of that individual conundrum and you could get group policies  and most of the group policies actually have things like pregnancy   paul continued   if you work for general motors  my guess is pregnancy is automatically in your insurance because you are a big group and you have the leverage to demand it  burnett took the argument for a collective large group insurance and ran with it  so why not go for the biggest group of all and just have insurance for everybody   she retorted  well  socialism s not a good idea   said paul  using the venezuelan health crisis as a model for socialism s failures burnet slammed back   but you did make a great argument for nationalized healthcare  you said  the bigger the group the lower the cost   so i m taking your argument to its logical conclusion  paul then tried to take back what he said   i was talking about voluntary groups  not the gulag  too late  paul  you brought up the real solution to the healthcare crisis without even realizing what you were saying  the cat is out of the bag watch the whole hilarious conversation via cnn here featured image via screen capture
