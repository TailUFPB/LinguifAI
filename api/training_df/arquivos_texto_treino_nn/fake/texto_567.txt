there are a lot of polls out there  a lot of research  and it s hard to discern what s real from the signal to noise ratio  that s why  as a general rule  i prefer to read studies  polls  academic papers   the things meant to educate me   from people who aren t getting paid to produce them  not that a paycheck is bad  mind you  it just creates a motive for a certain outcome that usually aligns with the checkbook holder s opinion  the public religion research institute  prri  is a non profit whose focus i suppose you can probably guess the newest paper from prri comes on the heels of trump s directive to the doj to begin investigating universities for discriminating against white people  like all republicans  trump believes that affirmative action  by leveling the playing field  actually tilts it in favor of people of color that s asinine  but i guarantee that you   whoever you are  reading this  you know someone who thinks the same thing in fact  that was the focus of prri s latest research  this graph shows responses from different demographics to queries on just who  exactly  is discriminated against in america there are some interesting takeaways here  first  of course  is that democrats are likeliest to see discrimination where it demonstrably exists  to be a partisan at least requires one to be versed in the aims of the party they favor  and democrats aim to reduce discrimination  but even more fascinating to me are the averages  over in the  all americans  section of the graph  this reflected the opinions of both partisan groups and those who identified as neither  combined the fact that any respondents indicated they thought there even was discrimination against whites is hilarious to me  i personally think they re confusing  you didn t get that job  with  you kinda felt uncomfortable on the subway the other night   but i don t really have science on my side with that informal study  but christians  are you kidding me  you don t even have to be a member to get their holidays off work  that kind of response makes republicans even more heartbreakingly stupid than i thought in literally every case  the group of democratic respondents is closer to the views of all americans than the group of republicans  all of them  look back at the graph and do the addition or subtraction  in every case  republicans were less likely to see discrimination where it does exist and more likely to see it where it does not me  looking for an image for this article   screenshot explains a lot  doesn t it featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
