donald trump s secretary of education  betsy devos  doesn t just have trouble with grammar  apparently  she struggles with american history as well following trump s meeting with the leaders of historically black colleges and universities  hbcus   devos sent out a tweet that can only be described as completely clueless  according to the new education secretary  hbcus are pioneers of  school choice  wowwowwow  these paragraphs are from a real  official us department of education statement from betsy devos released today  pic twitter com   ankit panda   nktpnd  february    couldn t have gotten things more backward if she had tried  historically black schools aren t models of  school choice   in fact  it is the exact opposite  these schools arose because there was no choice  slaves were forbidden from learning how to read and write  following their emancipation  most white schools refused to let black students in the first hbcus were started to educate black teachers so that black children would have a shot at receiving any type of education at all  later  in addition to the private institutions that had been founded  southern states set up public colleges to serve blacks rather than integrate existing schools if devos really believes this is something to aspire to  it certainly does explain a lot  as secretary of education  she plans to  fix  our  broken  education system by diverting federal funds from public schools to private schools  which are largely unregulated  critics argue that this will serve only to accelerate the resegregation of american schools following the integration of public schools in america  white parents who didn t want their children to share classrooms with black students opted to send their children to private schools  in the decade following the passage of the civil rights act  approximately half a million white students left public schools for private ones maybe devos isn t just an idiot with no understanding of history after all  between her tweet and her vision for the future of american schools  we are forced to ask if taking our children and their education back to the days of jim crow has really been her intention all along featured image via mario tama getty images
