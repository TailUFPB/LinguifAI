throughout the campaign  many have tried defending trump by saying that he was once a democrat  so he must secretly be a liberal  or something  well  trump s pick for his cabinet are among the most conservative possible  and his pick for labor secretary is not only  ber socially conservative  he would probably opt for slave labor if it was an option andy puzder is the ceo of carl s jr  and hardee s   you know  that company that has  family values  ads like this one we don t know if it s a shared love for scantily clad women in semi pornographic settings that drew donald trump to puzder  but trump is considering him as labor secretary and that s very bad news for labor in may  pudzer penned a petulant op ed in which he said he would replace all his employees with robots if congress raised the minimum wage  that s right  the so called populist president elect wants someone in charge of labor who believes that if you can t dramatically underpay employees  then why have employees at all  pudzer s salary is upwards of   million a year  his employees make somewhere around double the poverty level  assuming they are not parents and are working full time oh  it gets worse  a lot worse  puzder  like many of trump s picks  is painfully  to the nation  socially conservative  puzder  in his previous life  was a trial lawyer and as a trial lawyer  he wrote one of the most restrictive anti abortion laws of that time puzder isn t completely in lock step with the isolationist trump  though  he does support free trade  puzder s views run contrary to the key part of trump s platform  pudzer is for immigration reform  but it sort of seems to depend on who s in office  pudzer loves the cheap labor that immigrants can provide  but not if president obama is behind it immigration reform requires legislative action  not an executive mandate  on that point  last week  numerous business executives  political leaders and i sent a letter to the republican members of congress imploring them to reform our broken immigration system  the letter encourages congress to pass legislation that  discourages the rising tide of illegal immigration while fixing the unnecessary obstacles that send talented individuals elsewhere and make it harder for american companies to compete  grow and create jobs for american workers  source  real clear politicsregardless  trump is sending a definite message to the nation  which is that his voters and the working people of america don t matter at all  trump isn t going to save jobs  but he could help lower wages and puzder is the perfect person to help do that featured image via drew angerer getty images
