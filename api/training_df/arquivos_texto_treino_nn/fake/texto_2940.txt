one of the most devastated and vulnerable communities under a donald trump administration will be the lgbtq community  the  gop platform is easily one of the most explicitly anti lgbtq in history  they plan to do all they can to discriminate openly  and with control of the entire federal government  they have no one to stop them however  there are a few things that happened on president obama s watch that the republicans will find that their hands are tied on  firstly  the bigots like mike pence and others in trump s administration can gnash their teeth all they want  but the supreme court already ruled on marriage equality  it s done the only potential caveat here is that  with the death of justice antonin scalia  there s a vacant seat that the gop obstructionists refused to allow president obama to fill  though it was rightfully his  even so  it takes a  vote majority for the senate to confirm a scotus justice  and no way will the democrats go for some right wing  homophobic nut on that one  they could try the nuclear option  of course  to that end  let s just make sure we keep justice ruth bader ginsberg in tip top shape until we get rid of trump  pence  and their cabinet of horrors secondly  president obama was forceful with the issue of repealing don t ask  don t tell  the united states armed forces now has openly lgbtq soldiers serving in all branches  and transitions for transgender folks are covered as well  president obama famously told his military chiefs that they could step down if they had issues with his repeal  this is a done deal  and what are they going to do  waltz in and kick all the gay soldiers out  didn t think so  even pence can t be that stupid next is the fight for transgender rights  while a lot of the legal stuff was by executive order  and pence will likely demand that it all be undone immediately  what they cannot undo is public perception  if this extremist administration goes aggressively after transgender people   who are easily the most vulnerable in our society   they will face swift and immediate backlash  trump is already entering office as the least popular president in modern history  with the scandal of an investigation into his ties to russia already hanging over his head  he isn t going to want to make himself even less popular by going after a group of people whose issues are front and center for the first time in history president obama also made a point of appointing hordes of openly gay judges to federal judgeships  these folks will smack down anything unconstitutional done against us in the name of trump and pence s bigotry  and there isn t a damn thing they can do about it  absent violating the law  federal judges stay on the bench as long as they damn well please lastly   but perhaps most importantly   president obama s open support of lgbtq people pushed our issues to the forefront and changed public perception of us  the bigoted views of the people in trump s cabinet of extremists are far outside the mainstream  we have president obama to thank for that  he aggressively promoted equality here at home and on the world stage  he wasn t afraid to call out the bigotry of politicians in the united states  nor those abroad  he deliberately sent gay united states delegates to russia s sochi olympics  in a blatant rebuke of vladimir putin s campaign of hate against lgbtq citizens  he also smacked down the kenyan president over his country s brutal homophobia  and  in a last nod to our community  president obama made clear his feelings on the brutal treatment of transgender prisoners by commuting chelsea manning s sentence on the way out the door thank you  president obama  for protecting our community  who knows where we d be without you  we re going to miss you so much featured image via screen capture from twitter
