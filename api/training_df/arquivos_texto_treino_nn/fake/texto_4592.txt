the legendary anthropologist and expert on primates made some interesting remarks to the atlantic prior to trump officially being crowned as the republican nominee at the gop convention in july in trump  goodall sees a male chimpanzee trying to gain dominance by making as much noise as possible in many ways the performances of donald trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals   goodall said   in order to impress rivals  males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays  stamping  slapping the ground  dragging branches  throwing rocks  the more vigorous and imaginative the display  the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy  and the longer he is likely to maintain that position  clearly  that was exactly the case within the republican party as trump threw his shit at every single one of his gop rivals and continued winning primaries in state after state despite being the most outrageous candidate in the field now he thinks he can do the same thing against hillary clinton to win the presidency in november  but first  trump will have to debate hillary  assuming that he doesn t pull out of the debates like the coward he is goodall plans to watch the debates with rapt attention because she thinks trump will act like a chimpanzee named mike according to the atlantic  goodall said in her book my life with the chimpanzees  goodall told the story of  mike   a chimp who maintained his dominance by kicking a series of kerosene cans ahead of him as he moved down a road  creating confusion and noise that made his rivals flee and cower  she told me she would be thinking of mike as she watched the upcoming debates indeed  trump has made  creating confusion and noise  the centerpiece of his campaign  most recently by trying to blame hillary clinton for the rise of birtherism despite the fact that hillary  nor her campaign  ever leveled such charges against president obama  trump has also made outrageous claims about hillary s health and said that her secret service detail should disarm themselves to see how long she lasts before being killed trump hopes that being the loudest and most obnoxious candidate will secure victory on election day  but americans really need to ask themselves  do we want a firestarter chimpanzee at the helm or do we want a civilized human being  do we want to revert back into acting like apes  or do we want to continue to evolve  the choice is ours featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
