while many racist donald trump supporters are praising the way the republican nominee doubled down on his disastrous immigration policies yesterday in his speech  it has caused several conservative hispanic supporters to rethink their decision to back the business mogul earlier today  alfonso aguilar  the president of latino partnership for conservative principles  made a public show of withdrawing his support for trump on cnn  and elaborated on a tweet that said he d felt  disappointed and misled  by trump s immigration speech twitteron cnn  aguilar told host carol costello that this major immigration speech had cost trump aguilar s vote  as well as many other latino supporters  when he became the nominee  i thought it was important to give him a second chance  i m terrified about hillary clinton  and so i decided to support him and i thought that we could work with him and the campaign to move him to the center on immigration  and the initial response was very good  aguilar pointed out the inconsistencies in trump s message  as well as the harsh policy trump was pushing now  he said he was going to treat undocumented immigrants without criminal records in a humane and compassionate way  he said he was going to soften his position  and then we heard yesterday and i was totally disappointed  not surprised  but disappointed and likely misled  because he gave the impression  the campaign gave the impression until yesterday morning that he was going to deal with the undocumented in a compassionate way  and in that speech  he s basically saying  we deport you or we self deport you  it s even worse than what he initially proposed  trump s speech was so offensive  that aguilar is taking back his endorsement of trump  so today i m saying  not only am i considering withdrawing my support  i m telling you today  i m withdrawing my support from donald trump  and it s not only me  many like me think the same way  i m so sorry  i just can t be part of that  trump has flip flopped on immigration several times over the last few weeks  but it seems that for many of his supporters  this is the final straw  it s about time featured image via screenshots
