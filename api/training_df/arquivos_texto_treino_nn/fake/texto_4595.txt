rachel maddow has a way of cutting to the point with a very sharp knife  and if the point is raw and bloody when she s done  then it deserves to be  on friday night  maddow discussed the dangerous  white supremacist views of the alt right  and how they relate to donald trump s campaign  one side of american politics is pulling a drag bar through the sewer tank of what gets flushed out of normal politics  she s right   the fact that white supremacists that think immigration from anywhere other than europe means white genocide are embracing trump is extremely telling she began this particular segment with a clip of hillary clinton denouncing trump and the dangerous alt right  those total bigots held a press conference last week  where they discussed the need for a white homeland as though it was the most natural thing on the planet  to them  trump is their white  emphasis on white  knight in shining armor   spencer  was greeted with much applause by his fans in the room  he elaborated that rather than a multicultural america  his ideal is a white empire  he described his  dream ethno state  as  a homeland for all europeans   which would take an  imperial form  here s how trump fits into that  via mother jones spencer s ideas about race are intertwined with his support for trump  spencer explained that he likes trump s immigration policy  which not only calls for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants but also reduces legal immigration into the country   spencer s ideal policy would also favor immigrants from europe   but as spencer put it  it s trump s more intangible qualities that make him a hero of the alt right  to spencer  trump s brash style suggests a white savoir  unwilling to be bullied by the politically correct crowd  these are the people who love donald trump  and that s what maddow was highlighting in her show this evening  watch some of it below they ve made him one of their own because  to them  he hates everyone they hate  he ll make the white race truly superior again  note that we said  everyone   that s not by accident  the alt right wants an actual homeland for white people  because to them  white people are victims  and have totally not forced themselves on other cultures at all  spencer proposed the following  mantra  for his movement   race is real  race matters  and race is the foundation of identity   the ultimate ideal is that the world be divided into ethno states so that white people could have a  homeland   and trump is directly feeding into that  the fact that those closest to him love pepe the frog a symbol co opted by the alt right proves that  pepe the frog was a symbol for  well  pretty much everything  but now white supremacists use him for their eugenics propaganda  it s sick  it s disgusting  and it needs to stop  these people need to go back to the far fringes where they effing belong featured image by frederick m  brown getty images
