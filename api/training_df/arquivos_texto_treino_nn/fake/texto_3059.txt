president barack obama gave an amazing farewell address last night as he captivated americans across the country and said goodbye to his time as president of the united states  at a time when many of us were feeling heartbroken and depressed that this great leader would now be followed by an underserving former reality television star  obama made sure to leave us with a message of hope and reminded us of what we re fighting for  it was a beautiful speech  and it highlighted everything we are going to miss about him one of the more notable parts of the speech was an epic burn obama delivered  aimed right at president elect donald trump  while obama never once said trump s name  it was blatantly obvious who he was talking about as he spoke about the need for diverse groups of workers to unite and stand together  slamming trump s divisive rhetoric and policies  obama reached out to workers of all ages  races  genders  and professions when he said  but we re not where we need to be  all of us have more work to do  after all  if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities  then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves  if we decline to invest in the children of immigrants  just because they don t look like us  we diminish the prospects of our own children   because those brown kids will represent a larger share of america s workforce  and our economy doesn t have to be a zero sum game  last year  incomes rose for all races  all age groups  for men and for women  beautifully said  while trump may have won the election by dividing americans and speaking only to white workers in certain professions  americans can stop him from dividing us further by standing together  aside from preventing trump from creating more division  united workers must also defy him by standing up to his greedy pro corporation agenda which will only benefit the wealthiest obama knew that he had to inspire americans enough to get them through the next four years under the worst administration they ve ever been faced with  he succeeded once again you can watch obama a full farewell address below  starting at around the  minute mark featured image via darren hauck   getty images
