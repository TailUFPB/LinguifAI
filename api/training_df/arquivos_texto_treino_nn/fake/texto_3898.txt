this is not something that happens every day  but it s exactly what ana navarro did on monday navarro has been a republican since ronald reagan was in office  but the rise of donald trump as the gop nominee has disgusted her so much that she denounced the party said she would be writing in her mother s name on her ballot rather than give a vote to trump but navarro changed her mind after thinking about the close election in florida in  in which george w  bush won by a mere  votes  as a florida resident  navarro doesn t want a repeat that send trump to the white house so she cast her vote for hillary and told the world all about it in a column published on cnn i had hoped that a week before the election  trump would be losing florida by a large enough margin that my vote wouldn t matter  but darn it  my home state is too close to call  florida could be the decisive state  again  as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the united states  i thought back to the  election  which was decided by  votes in florida  i thought about how i would feel if the same thing happened in   i thought and i thought and i thought  then i cast my vote for hillary clinton  let me rephrase that  i cast my vote against donald trump  i did it without joy or enthusiasm  i did it out of civic duty and love for our country navarro  who is an immigrant  said she voted against trump because of the way he has insulted and demonized immigrants like her over the past year and half  on the first day of his campaign  trump called mexicans  rapists  and as a hispanic immigrant that infuriated navarro  i voted against donald trump for every american who looks and sounds like me   navarro wrote   because we love this country  we are proud of this country  we stand as equals in the united states of america  trump has also repeatedly insulted women  and as a woman herself  that disgusted navarro to her core  i voted against donald trump because of all women in my life who have been sexually harassed or assaulted and remained silent  bearing the embarrassment  even shame  for years   she continued and trump has also insulted disabled americans  which made this election gave navarro a more personal reason to vote against trump i voted against trump because of daniel navarro  my severely disabled brother  my entire life  i have been pained and angered seeing young kids stare at him and mimic his disability  i had never seen a grown man mimic a disabled person  trump did so in front of thousands of people at one of his rallies  in front of millions of people watching on tv  most of us would punish our children for exhibiting such behavior for navarro it came down to choosing a candidate who has bad character or a candidate who made some bad judgments  in the end  navarro voted for the latter because she believes a president needs to be a role model for children and while bad judgments can be avoided in the future  bad character won t change she slammed trump for being a terrible role model and blasted him for calling our democratic system rigged just because he is losing  and that s why she urged everyone to use their vote as a weapon to defeat trump  some tell me  in  we should no longer expect the president of the united states to be a role model   navarro wrote   i refuse to accept that  the president of the united states has to lift us all in moments of national grief  the president of the united states has to hug the children and spouses of fallen soldiers  that person represents us all  that person is recognized as the face and the voice for america in front of the rest of the world  and more importantly  by our children  a person supported by the klu klux klan and its former grand wizard david duke can never represent me  he can never be a role model for me we each have a right and a duty to make a personal choice based on those things that are most important to us  that we value most  my conscience compels me to do every little thing i can to make sure a bad person is not our next president  in america  we don t choose our leaders through violence or armed insurrections one vote is our right  one vote is our weapon  i am exercising mine against donald trump donald trump is so toxic that many republicans like navarro have jumped ship to endorse or vote for hillary clinton  so much so that some red states such as texas  arizona  and georgia are in play for the democrats this year and may end up becoming battleground states in elections to come  that s how bad republicans screwed up by choosing trump as their leader featured image  twitter
