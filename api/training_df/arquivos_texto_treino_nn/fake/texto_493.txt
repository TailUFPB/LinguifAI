donald trump has an endless history of racism that dates back decades  so it comes as no surprise that he has now pardoned the very bigoted and controversial former maricopa county  arizona sheriff joe arpaio  this is a man who was convicted of being a bigot and using the law and the powers of his office to racially profile and brutalize latino citizens  he was found in criminal and civil contempt of court  but of course  since he was targeting latinos  who trump hates  that is just a okay with the orange fascist generally  when people receive pardons  they have served some time  and shown some remorse  this is nothing more than an extension of trump s open and visible contempt for non white immigrants and those from mexico in particular   and all minorities  really   this comes as no surprise  reprehensible as it is also  to top it all off  sheriff joe is a birther  and he constantly went to the press to dispute the validity of president obama s birth certificate in explicitly racist terms  this  of course  was trump s number one crusade in his original foray into presidential politics  and it was a huge factor in his gaining real traction with the racist republican base voters of course  we cannot forget the infamous  tent city  in which imprisoned immigrants were housed in tents and forced to be humiliated with pink underwear  it goes on and on this is disgusting  a racist who was found to have used the power of his elected office to enact racism as policy is now going free because the guy squatting in the oval office is a racist  too all i can say is that at least the people of maricopa county voted him out after all of these years and all of this open bigotry as policy if there isn t gop backlash from this  we need to all rise up  this is beyond appalling  with this pardon  racism is officially law in america featured image via ralph freso getty images
