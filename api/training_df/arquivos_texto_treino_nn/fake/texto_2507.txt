how can the israelis  or any jewish person for that matter  trust donald trump if he can t even answer this question seriously during his press conference with benjamin netanyahu  trump took a question from a reporter who wanted to to know what he plans to do about the rising incidents of hate and anti semitism in this country and asked trump to also address the fact that members of his own team have taken racist tones  mr  president  since your election campaign and even after your victory  we ve seen a sharp rise in anti semitic   anti  semitic incidents across the united states   the reporter began   and i wonder  what do you say to those among the jewish community in the states and in israel and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones  indeed  hate crimes have skyrocketed across the nation since trump was elected and he has done very little to combat them  meanwhile  trump s administration included white nationalist steve bannon and racist jeff sessions and all but two members of trump s cabinet are white men in response to the question  trump outrageously proceeded to brag extensively about his electoral college victory as if that somehow will stop anti semitism  well  i just want to say that we are  you know  very honored by the victory that we had    electoral college votes   trump said   we were not supposed to crack   you know that  right  there was no way to   but then they said there s no way to   and there s tremendous enthusiasm out there  trump couldn t even get his own election count right  first  he received  votes when the electoral college met in december  furthermore  his win is one of the smallest on record and he also lost the popular vote by nearly  million votes trump then claimed that he will bring peace to america and went on to use a line that sounds eerily similar to a racist saying they aren t racist by claiming to have black friends  in trump s case  he suggested that anti semitism will be magically solved by his administration because he has jewish family members  he concluded by telling the reporter that he will  see a lot of love  over the next few years i will say that we are going to have peace in this country  we are going to stop crime in this country  we are going to do everything within our power to stop long simmering racism and every other thing that s going on  there s a lot of bad things that have been taking place over a long period of time i think one of the reasons i won the election is we have a very  very divided nation  very divided  and hopefully  i ll be able to do something about that  and i  you know  it was something that was very important to me as far as people  jewish people  so many friends  a daughter who happens to be here right now  a son in law  and three beautiful grandchildren  i think that you re going to see a lot different united states of america over the next three  four or eight years  i think a lot of good things are happening and you re going to see a lot of love  you re going to see a lot of love here s the video via youtube let s not forget that neo nazis supported trump s campaign and they continue to support him today  let s also not forget that trump didn t mention jews at all when he issued a statement in remembrance of the holocaust  a tragedy that resulted in  million jews being murdered by hitler once again  trump demonstrates that he is an embarrassment  he had a chance to address this issue seriously  but he made it all about him and his ego before making very few references to anti semitism and how he plans to actually stop it  he didn t even mention jews beyond pointing out that he has jewish family members as if that somehow makes him qualified to deal with anti semitism trump is clearly not fit to be president featured image via screenshot
