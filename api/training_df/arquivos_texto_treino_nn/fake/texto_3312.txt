fox news worked for eight years to vilify president obama in any way they could  and now obama is calling them out because he has zero f cks left during an interview with the atlantic  president obama talked to ta nehisi coates about how right wing media invented a  fictional  version of him with the purpose of scaring and enraging white people  in  i was never subjected to the kind of concentrated vilification of fox news  rush limbaugh  the whole conservative media ecosystem  and so as a consequence  even for my first two years as a senator i was polling at  percent   obama said they weren t seeing some image of me as trying to take away their stuff and give it to black people  and coddle criminals  and all the stereotypes of not just african american politicians but liberal politicians  you started to see that kind of prism being established towards the end of the  race  particularly once sarah palin was the nominee  and obviously almost immediately after i was elected  it was deployed in full force  and it had an impact in terms of how a large portion of white voters would see me  and so when people criticize or respond negatively to me  usually they re responding to this character that they re seeing on tv called barack obama  or to the office of the presidency and the white house and what that represents  and so you don t take it personally  you understand that if people are angry that somehow the government is failing  then they are going to look to the guy who represents government  and that applies  by the way  even to some of the folks who are now trump supporters  they re responding to a fictional character named barack obama who they see on fox news or who they hear about through rush limbaugh indeed  conservatives websites and political shows constantly twisted president obama s words and turned him into a monster who was going to take away everyone s guns any second and declare himself king  every time more jobs were added to the economy or the stock market rose  or unemployment dropped or anything good happened in this country  conservatives ignored it or accused obama of cooking the books or made it sound like a bad thing in order to make people hate president obama they were wrong  of course  but conservatives went on hating president obama anyway because they refused to listen to anything outside the conservative echo chamber  as a result  conservatives reject facts and think the truth is whatever fox news tells them it is and now the same conservative echo chamber that vilified president obama is now praising trump like he s a gift from god who has never done anything wrong and doesn t lie  any person with a brain knows that s bullshit  but conservatives are eating it up like the gullible fools they are featured image  win mcnamee getty images
