president trump is pissing off a lot of his fellow republicans with his inability to cooperate with normal  law abiding governmental business  and some are giving the president a piece of their minds the president s legal team has been trying to limit the ability of congress to obtain crucial information from the executive branch  and sen  chuck grassley openly blasted them for it the senator lets loose in a  page letter on june    this is nonsense   said grassley  slamming them for their violations of the separation of powers and trying to get around the checks and balances that are crucial for u s  government to run the june  letter is a heated statement from a pissed off lawmaker about white house s office counsel opinion that the president and his staff should be able to flat out deny information requests from anyone other than the chairmen of congressional committees senator grassley s view is that it s total bullshit  and basically a way for the whitehouse to cover up whatever it wants  it erroneously rejects any notion that individual members of congress who may not chair a relevant committee need to obtain information from the executive branch in order to carry out their constitutional duties  it falsely asserts that only requests from committees or their chairs are  constitutionally authorized   and relegates requests from non chairmen to the position of  non oversight  inquiries   whatever that means  for olc to so fundamentally misunderstand and misstate such a simple fact exposes its shocking lack of professionalism and objectivity  indeed  olc appears to have utterly failed to live up to its own standards  you are being ill served and ill advised  the whole process of checks and balances relies on the ability of any member of the u s  senate or house of representatives to be able to request and obtain any needed information from the executive branch  the powers vested in the congress   both explicitly and inherently by the constitution   impose significant and far reaching responsibilities on the people s elected representatives   he said   they include the authorization and appropriation of federal funds  the organization of federal departments  the enactment of laws executing the enumerated powers  the confirmation of nominees  the impeachment and removal of officers  and the investigation of the execution of the laws and of waste  fraud  and abuse in federal programs  these responsibilities are all forms of oversight  all mechanisms that support the legislative check and balance of the executive power  all members participate in deciding whether  when  and how congress will exercise these authorities  grassley goes on to explain that by selectively deciding who it will respond to  the executive branch is spitting in the face of transparency  discouraging bipartisanship  and getting in the way of the ability of our representatives to effectively do their jobs  information requests are not hostile threats  they are how congress makes decisions and does it s job senator grassley concluded the letter by asking that the olc take back the request altogether  it harms not just the members who happen to be in the minority party at the moment  but also  members in the majority party who are not currently chairmen  it obstructs what ought to be the natural flow of information between agencies and the committees  which frustrates the constitutional function of legislating  photo by chip somodevilla getty images
