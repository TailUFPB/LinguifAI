donald trump s pathetic outreach effort to sway black voters into supporting him just took a major hit just when you thought trump and his supporters couldn t say anything worse to offend black people  a north carolina pastor who supports the republican nominee just pitched a  let s send black people back to africa  plan reminiscent of similar ideas racists have had throughout american history during an interview with cnn host carol costello  thomas rodgers  sr  of antioch road to glory international ministries advocated on the air for  returning  black people to africa to get jobs building a road to the united states across the atlantic ocean rodgers claimed that african americans  do not seek dual citizenship  and said that is why black people join gangs  oh  he also says black people have  no vision  and  no leadership  african americans are the only people in the world who do not seek dual citizenship  that s why chicago gangs  california gangs  the crips and the bloods and detroit in michigan   we have gangs in the streets because blacks have no vision  they have no leadership  costello then asked rodgers to explain his idea to build a bridge to africa  and that s when the interview completely went off the rails  matter of fact  where our ancestors came from  from the indian ocean all the way across the atlantic ocean  that s   miles and we want to go back and help with the highways all the way across  to create jobs  train rails  pipelines  oil  petroleum  they create jobs for young people that can t find jobs here  that the democrats have not did  of course  the unemployment rate in the black community dropped to   percent under the policies of president obama  a democrat and it was  percent under democratic president bill clinton  so rodgers is wrong on that point a confused costello asked   so you are suggesting young people in trouble should go back to africa  perhaps to find jobs  rodgers argued semantics  claiming that he is just calling for black people  to return  to africa  which is basically the same thing as going back  just using a different wording  and then he claimed that black people don t want to stay in this country  it s a clause in the united nations charter  our right to return  to help build infrastructure  everybody don t want to stay here  we are skilled people  rodgers  remarks drew laughter from strategist angela rye  whose facial reactions while rodgers spoke were the same that every normal person watching at home were making  pointed out that building a literal bridge between the united states and africa is impossible here s the video via youtube the suggestion that black people should be sent back or  returned  to africa has been around for a long time  particularly by white supremacists who want to turn america white again  which is why they support donald trump it s offensive and suggests that black people are not capable of living in western societies the fact is  however  that systemic racism in this country has held african americans back and that is what needs to change  black people do not need to be sent back anywhere  the system just has to be fixed so that it benefits everyone equally rodgers  remarks should guarantee that republicans never get a vote from a black person ever again featured image via spencer platt getty images
