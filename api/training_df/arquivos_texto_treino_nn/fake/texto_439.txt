we always knew that donald trump was a heartless bastard  however  he just decided to leave no doubt about that fact in the minds of the american people  as the orange one has decided to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca   which is an obama era program that protects children who arrived in the united states illegally when they were very young from deportation  the announcement came late sunday night  as millions of people waited anxiously to see what the fate of their family members and friends   and for daca recipients  themselves   would be according to politico  trump will phase the program out within six months  leaving   daca recipients subject to immediate deportation  it seems that the six month waiting period to start deporting daca recipients  also known as dreamers  is to give congress time to solve the problem of undocumented children themselves  the argument seems to be that a lot of people in trump s orbit believe that immigration policies like daca are the job of lawmakers  not the president  and therefore president obama had no right to do what he did for the dreamers this all comes as many lawmakers   including many republicans   have said that trump should leave the daca kids alone  after all  these are people who know no other home  who came here as very small children and are americans in every way except on paper  they literally have nowhere to go if trump and his goons deport them now  it should be noted that this is not an official announcement and that it came from white house sources with knowledge of the upcoming announcement who spoke to politico reporters  since trump is impulsive and unpredictable  there is still time for all of this to change  hopefully  congress will do something during the six month window  rendering this awful decision moot anyone who thought this administration wouldn t be on a mission to destroy the lives of millions of people was completely deluded  we now see that team trump is on their way to making america into their fever dream of a white ethnostate   or as close to it as they can come  that s what you get when dumb people decide it would be a great idea to have a racist run the country featured image via screen capture from twitter
