 education standards   it seems  is now a term fraught with intent  by and large  standards are set by the states that uphold them  with localities left to decide how best to implement those standards through lesson plans  specialized curriculum  and testing  but if you re a voter  you have at some point checked a box on a ballot for someone on a school board  or at the very least a school superintendent  that means that in a time like now  when the phrase  all politics is local  has taken on the most literal meaning you can imagine  local politics can sometimes determine what your children learn to make matters worse  textbook manufacturers are as subject to political winds   and capitalism   as the next industry  that means they want to produce their books in markets where they can sell the most  which gives big states like california and texas  whose student populations vastly outmatch those of other states  huge influence over education standards even outside their borders when a state is reliably  blue   as california is  that can shake out favorably for proponents of science  history  civics   basically everything where facts are involved  but when a state is more often  red   as in the case of texas  it can be bad for those same things what happens  though  when a state is more  purple   like new mexico we re finding out now  the new science education standards for the southwestern state are raising eyebrows  and that s saying something for a state in which the long serving public education secretary resigned after  years on the job  hanna skandera  who was appointed by republican governor susana martinez  had faced intense scrutiny from both democratic lawmakers and from teachers in the state over previously proposed education reforms   a through f   grading for young elementary students and a variety of other changes skandera had sought while serving in the same capacity in florida under governor jeb  bush made her a target of teachers  unions and parent groups across the state martinez was very unhappy about the pressure that caused skandera to resign but the proposed changes to science in new mexico were initially based on the next generation science standards  guidelines released back in  and eventually passed by both chambers of the new mexico legislature  it was when the proposed changes made it to governor martinez  desk that issues arose  she vetoed the bill  citing her authority to properly  vet  the new standards now those standards look considerably different than what the legislature passed mother jones outlined some of the changes two democrats in the state  representing districts  and   have pointed squarely at governor martinez in an op ed in the las cruces sun news during one of the committee hearings  a former member of her staff admitted the reason for the governor s decision   toward the end of my tenure at the public education department  i was tasked to edit and change some of the language in the standards to make them politically sanitized  no matter whether changes come from school boards  legislatures  or directly from a governor s office  changes to education standards should never be politicized  unless this is stopped  new mexico is just setting a new standard for how other states might politicize them in the future featured image via peter macdiarmid getty images
