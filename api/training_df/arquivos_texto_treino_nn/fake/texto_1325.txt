michael cohen is a man who knows donald trump well  he has been trump s personal lawyer for many years  and he spent the better part of two years during the  presidential campaign lying for trump on television like all of other surrogates for the orange man  now  however  cohen may come to regret this allegiance  as it seems that the russia probe is now closing in around the loyal lawyer the intelligence committees in the house of representatives and the senate recently asked cohen if he would provide information and testimony regarding his links and dealings with russia  cohen  like everyone else in trump s orbit  decided to refuse to cooperate fully with the investigation  insisting that there s nothing to see there  and that the people investigating them are reaching too far into things but  he forgets that these committees have subpoena power  and the senate intelligence committee voted on whether or not to give chairman richard burr  r nc  and ranking member mark warner  d va  the ability to subpoena the things they want from cohen  the result was unanimous  and since cohen will not give the congress what they want  senators burr and warner will simply subpoena the information  further  it is being reported that the house intelligence committee wasted no time  and they have already sent out a subpoena to cohen  if cohen goes the michael flynn route and ignores the subpoenas  he can be held in contempt of congress it seems that everyone around trump has had some kind of seemingly shady and or inappropriate dealings with russia  couple that with the fact that trump himself is praising and cozying up to vladimir putin and other brutal dictators around the world  all while slamming our allies at the nato and  summits  and all of this is very dangerous indeed hopefully  congress  the fbi  and whomever else is involved in investigating this corrupt administration of incompetent authoritarians and russian stooges gets to the bottom of all of this soon  so that we can apologize to our allies and go back to being a sane nation after all of these people are removed from office and thrown in jail featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
