a movement has apparently been afoot in many starbucks stores around the country   trump fans have been putting  trump  on their cups so that the baristas have to shout the cheeto king s name  they were angry with the company after ceo howard schultz endorsed hillary for president  which gave birth to a hashtag called  trumpcup  trumpcup blew up when a racist bigot in a miami store with a long line claimed the staff refused to give him his coffee because he supported trump  in truth  the line at the store was long  they were backed up  and this delicate  privileged white guy thought he was more important than everyone else   especially the black baristas he no doubt saw as his servants  he claimed he was having a bad day  and then did an about face and claimed racial discrimination because he s white  poor boopsie because of that  trumpkins began widespread protests against the  anti white discrimination  at starbucks by buying more starbucks there s a very special irony here  they re punishing starbucks by giving the company their money  well  they actually probably think they re punishing individual baristas and store managers especially those who are minorities because they have the audacity to be minorities working for a company that endorsed hillary clinton  and so is obviously prejudiced against whites either way  they re more or less saying that starbucks must die  because reasons  and making them richer instead  they just don t seem to get that protesting a business means you don t spend your money there  the goal is to put such a dent in their sales that they have no choice but to change something  this absurd mistake has been pointed out multiple times on twitter i don t think trumpkins have thought this whole  trumpcup throughif you have to buy a product from the place you re boycotting  fail       november    our  trumpcup boycott was a success  now what    we protest gay marriage by blowing guys at a truck stop glory hole all day    brilliant   matt oswalt   mattoswaltva  november    starbucks by buying starbucks products and making the baristas write  trump  is not a protest  you  trumpcup people are wack  alexa losey   alexalosey  november    supporters are protesting starbucks by buying more starbucks  trumpcup   https   t co  pic twitter com   affinity magazine   theaffinitymag  november    let me get this straight  you re going to protest against a company by giving them money   trumpcup     tarzdan  november    supporters  we are going to boycott   take a stand against starbucks reality   continues making starbucks richer  trumpcup pic twitter com eqjhbtinhc  chihiro ogino   wickedbeaute  november    supporters are protesting starbucks ceo for supporting hillary by buying his over priced coffee  sounds like his voters   trumpcup  leslie hiatt   dlesmore  november    trumpsters i love your brilliant idea to protest starbucks by buying coffee there  boy  that ll sure show them       trumpcup  matthew chapman   fawfulfan  november    this can be filed under   trump fans are too dumb to know they re dumb   it really takes a special kind of dumb  though  to not know that trying to protest a company buy buying their product is jut about the most oblivious thing out there good luck with your protest  guys  starbucks is probably guffawing over how effective it isn t featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet
