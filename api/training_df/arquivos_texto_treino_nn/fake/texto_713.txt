once again  donald trump gets hilariously reminded of why people love president obama as we all know by now  trump fired chief of staff reince priebus on friday by leaving him all by himself on the tarmac after landing at andrews air force base  the firing comes only days after new communications director anthony scaramucci trashed him apparently  even trump himself repeatedly demeaned priebus  even going so far so as to call him  weak  and calling into the oval office to kill flies yeah  you heard that right according to the washington post for trump  the imperative to remove priebus heightened over the past  days or so  according to white house officials it reached a fever pitch of the president complaining about reince to all of us   said one senior white house official  who requested anonymity to speak candidly   if we heard it once  we heard it  times in the last week   this erosion of confidence  the word was  weak     weak    weak    weak    can t get it done  trump s demeaning of priebus came through in other ways  too  at one point  during a meeting in the oval office  a fly began buzzing overhead  distracting the president  as the fly continued to circle  trump summoned his chief of staff and tasked him with killing the insect  according to someone familiar with the incident indeed  being summoned to the oval office just to kill a fly is incredibly demeaning and shows exactly the kind of terrible boss trump is after all  president obama never summoned any of his top staff members into the oval office to kill flies  in fact  obama had the skills to kill his own flies  as he did during an interview early on in his presidency here s the video via youtube so while donald trump is apparently too lazy or too scared to kill flies on his own  president obama took matters into his own hands and got the job done of course  the internet had fun mocking trump and priebus for the incident  unconfirmed  priebus was ordered to swallow the fly   then a spider  then a bird  then a cat  etc        mk ultra        marykateclark  july    montgomery burns wouldn t ask smithers to do this https   t co   mark r  yzaguirre   markyzaguirre  july     he couldn t use his hands  he had to dehumanize the fly until it lost its will to go on  ian fortey   ianfortey  july     tongue promptly shot three feet from his mouth and snagged the fly mid flight   eatbees   eatbees  july    just proves that president obama was a far better leader than donald trump could ever hope to be  and that must really infuriate him featured image  screenshot
