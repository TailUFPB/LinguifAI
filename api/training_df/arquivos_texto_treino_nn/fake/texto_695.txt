if there s one thing donald trump fears the most  even more than negative press coverage or pending criminal indictments  is irrelevance  trump  though  is tweeting his way right into irrelevance  so much so that the gop congress  which has been shaking in its boots over losing the support of trump voters  is now completely ignoring him over the weekend  trump tweeted   unless the republican senators are total quitters  repeal   replace is not dead  demand another vote before voting on any other bill  unless the republican senators are total quitters  repeal   replace is not dead  demand another vote before voting on any other bill   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    republican congress didn t flinch sen  john cornyn  r texas  warned reporters monday not to  leap to conclusions  that republicans won t be able to pass a healthcare bill  but he appeared to hint that a second vote isn t imminent  what we do know is next is nominations and hopefully  schumer will agree to break the logjam   and that would be a good use of our next two weeks   the no   senate republican said source  the hillanother republican echoed the non response sen  roy blunt  r mo    another member of senate gop leadership  said republicans could circle back to healthcare when they reach a consensus  until then   it s time to move on  and put  wins on the board   he said  obviously we didn t give up and we didn t quit and we gave it our best shot  and we can come back to this at a later time   blunt said  asked about trump s tweets another gop rep thinks trump will be gone by the mid terms ouch  so much for the bully pulpit there are so many reasons not to take trump seriously  like the fact that he isn t a legitimate president and that massive populist movement that had the gop bowing at trump s feet really doesn t exist or  how about the fact that trump and his white house are likely going to be buried in criminal indictments any minute  that s not a bad reason for the gop to start distancing themselves maybe it s the constant state of chaos that is hurting trump s image  or perhaps it s the fact that he seems to know absolutely nothing about how this country works everyone who has watched the news over the last few days knows that repealing obamacare failed to get through the senate in a slim simple majority vote trump realized it right after the vote  republicans and  democrats let the american people down  as i said from the beginning  let obamacare implode  then deal  watch   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     though  he s been on a twitter rant about getting rid of the filibuster  even though there were no filibusters if republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the senate  they must immediately go to a  vote majority  not senseless   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    even though parts of healthcare could pass at   some really good things need   so many great future bills   budgets need  votes    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    senate must get rid of  vote now  it is killing the r party  allows  dems to control country   bills sit in senate  a joke   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    very outdated filibuster rule must go  budget reconciliation is killing r s in senate  mitch m  go to  votes now and win  it s time   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    in the senate will never win if they don t go to a  vote majority now  they look like fools and are just wasting time  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july      dems totally control the u s  senate  many great republican bills will never pass  like kate s law and complete healthcare  get smart   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     no they don t  if they did  you would be on trial if the senate democrats ever got the chance  they would switch to a  majority vote in first minute  they are laughing at r s  make change   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    actually did have the chance and harry reid didn t do it don t give up republican senators  the world is watching  repeal   replace and go to  votes  nuke option   get cross state lines   more   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    again  donald  they tried getting  votes and they failed what s most surprising about the gop s change of heart toward their dear leader is that it s taken this long  he s long shown himself as an erratic petulant man child who s loyal to exactly one person   him  at this point  all republicans can do is hope that they can stand far enough away so they won t be hit by shrapnel from his exploding administration featured image via pool getty images
