house speaker paul ryan is hugely unpopular  garnering only a  percent approval rating  apparently   graders disapprove of him  too  while on a field trip in washington  d c  on friday  about half of the  grade students from a south orange middle school refused to do a photo op with ryan  instead  the nearly  students opted to sit in a parking lot across the street while the remaining students took part in the photo op  according to mashable elissa malespina  a school librarian and the parent one of the eighth graders who declined the photo op  said that she is proud of her son  i am so proud of my son and   the  grade at south orange middle school   malespina wrote on facebook   they went to d c  on a field trip and toured the capitol building  the kids had a chance to have their picture taken with paul ryan and over half the class choose not to  including my son  what a powerful statement  i can t take a picture with someone who supports a budget that would destroy public education and would leave  million people without healthcare   matthew malespina  a student at the school  told the village green  it s not just a picture   student matthew told abc news   it s being associated with a person who puts his party before his country  i think that taking the picture represents that you agree with the same political views and i don t agree with his political views so i chose not to be in it   eighth grader wendy weeks said to some of the students  it had to do with ryan s association with donald trump  i didn t want to be in  because he believes in most of what trump believes in   louisa maynard parisi  told the village green even though their politics might be different from ryan s  other students decided to participate  i thought it would be interesting to see one of the nation s lawmakers in person even if i strongly disagree with many of his views   said alex klint  one of the  grader s said residents weighed in with conflicted feelings  i m sort of torn on this  although each kid has the right to make this choice    wrote one soma resident   even though i totally disagree with everything he stands for  he is a legitimately elected official and represents our government at work  meeting our representatives is an honor for a kid at least for what the office stands for  even if the person occupying that chair is less than honorable   and i do feel if there had been some conservative school where the kids refused to pose with president obama  we would have been appalled by that   the resident added matthew s mother told the paper   it is his right as a citizen to do so and i commend him and his fellow students for doing so in a respectful way  listen to the children they get it  photo by olivier douliery via getty images
