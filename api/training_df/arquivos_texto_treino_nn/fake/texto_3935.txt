george r r  martin  who is best known as the writer of  game of thrones   knows a little something about liars and bad leaders  he s written more than his share  he also knows that trump would be one of them  in fact  in an oped in livejournal  entitled  a simple observation   martin pretty much gave trump the blogging equivalent of one of game of thrones  bloodiest shows  okay  perhaps that s an exaggeration  but he wasn t kind to trump martin lives in new mexico  he s concerned because the state  which has been pretty safely blue in recent history  is now in play  although fivethirtyeight puts new mexico s five electoral votes pretty firmly in hillary s camp   because of that  martin has had a chance to see a lot of political ads from the presidential candidates  despite the media s insistence that both candidates are somehow equally flawed  martin sees big differences  even just in their ads  he sees one big difference   and this is coming from someone who makes at least part of his living in producing videos first  he talked about the trump commercials  which are very negative and frankly  pretty standard fare  with the exception of trump s vulgar and ugly language the trump commercials are all fairly standard political attack ads  you ve seen a thousand like them  find some bad pictures of the opponent  in this case hillary  pictures that make them look ugly or angry or crazed  easily done  there are thousands of unflattering pictures of any public figure floating around these days   if they are not bad enough  put them up in black   white  which always seems to make them worse  juxtapose them with negative imagery  maybe some out of context headlines  use a faceless narrator s voice over the pictures telling us that the candidate is corrupt or a liar or  too extreme   the latest trump ad manages to add anthony weiner  who is called  pervert anthony weiner   the blatant name calling   flinging around words like  pervert  and  crooked    is not something we have often seen before in american politics  unless you go back to the  and  centuries  that s trump s own original ugly contribution to lowering the tenor of political discourse  the rest  however  is attack ad  martin goes on to call trump s ads mostly  assertion  innuendo  and name calling   but with no substance here s on sample now on to clinton  and this says something pretty amazing about her in general  her ads are honest clinton s ads are something else  very different  and   to my mind   much more truthful  the star of all the clinton ads in donald j  trump  there are no deliberately unflattering photographs  however  nothing in black and white  just video clips  full color  professional footage from news cameras at his rallies  interviews  television appearances  there s no name calling either  clinton doesn t need to label trump as  crooked  or  a liar  or link him with  perverts   clinton s ads just show trump being trump so what we have here is not smith claiming that jones said terrible things  what we have is actual footage of jones saying and doing those things  no one has to accuse trump of anything  he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see here s an example g d knows there s enough footage out there  martin mentioned trump mocking a disabled reporter  he mentioned the  pussy grabbing  video  really  it goes on and on because nearly every time trump opens his mouth  something controversial and offensive comes out martin goes on to talk specifically about the candidates  and his opinion of trump is anything but favorable he didn t say much about hillary  but he did say this you don t need to like hillary  you don t need to listen to what hillary says about trump  or what i say about trump  you just need to listen to trump  if you can do that  and still consider voting for him  well oooh oooh  i can finish that sentence  if you can listen to trump and still consider voting for him well you don t really give a crap about the future of the country  well  perhaps martin had something more eloquent in mind featured image via kevin winter getty images
