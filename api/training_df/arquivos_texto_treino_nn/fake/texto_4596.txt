at this point  it is well known that there is no limit to how low donald trump will sink  but friday night  he walked onto the stage and proved that he has gone completely off the deep end  all without even opening his mouth remember his grand wwe style entrance at the republican national convention  well  that wasn t sh t compared to his entrance on friday night at a rally in miami  in a sick and twisted parody of les miserables  the gop nominee walked onto the stage with  do you hear the people sing   blaring across the loudspeakers and this backdrop behind him no  this is not a joke  no  this is not satire  yes  this really happened  yes  this is actually real life since trump has decided to embrace the term  deplorable  as an accurate description himself and his supporters  let s take another look at just who was in hillary clinton s now notorious  basket of deplorables   shall we  you know  just to be grossly generalist  you could put half of trump s supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables  the racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamaphobic   you name it  and unfortunately there are people like that  and he has lifted them up   clinton said at a rally last week despite all the fake outrage from the right that clinton would have the audacity to call them out for what they are   deplorable   trump has now decided to go ahead and use this as another dog whistle to his white supremacist followers  i won t even take the time here to go into the irony of trump using les miserables to bolster his campaign s bigoted message  instead  i will just draw attention to the fact that trump just walked on stage and proudly declared himself to be racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  and islamaphobic and without a doubt  his racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamaphobic supporters are eating it up  which also makes it very obvious that it isn t only trump who has lost his damn mind watch trump s entrance  here trump walks out to les miserables song with  les deplorables  sign behind him pic twitter com   nick corasaniti   nytnickc  september    image via video screen capture
