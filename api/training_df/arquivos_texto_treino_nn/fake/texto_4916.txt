it s not even a slight exaggeration to say that when the supreme court decided that right wing religious bigotry can take precedence above pretty much everything else  including common sense  they were setting some people up to die  year old melanie jones  who lives near chicago  didn t die  but only because she was lucky  she made the mistake of visiting her doctor  one her healthcare plan wanted her to visit  when she began bleeding heavily because her iud became dislodged  her doctor refused to remove her iud  even though something more dire could still happen  because the doctor was catholic  i think my first feeling was shock   jones told rewire in an interview   i thought that eventually they were going to recognize that my health was the top priority  it wasn t just her doctor  according to jones and two complaints filed by the aclu  the entire hospital couldn t help jones out because it was a catholic hospital  in fact  no one in her entire insurance network could help her  she had no idea that she had signed up with a catholic healthcare network  blue cross blue shield  the doctor left jones to confer with colleagues  before returning to confirm that her  hands  tied   according to two complaints filed by the aclu of illinois  not only could she not help her  the doctor said  but no one in jones  health insurance network could remove the iud  because all of them followed similar restrictions  mercy  like many catholic providers  follows directives issued by the u s  conference of catholic bishops that restrict access to an array of services  including abortion care  tubal ligations  and contraception the only way jones had left to get her iud removed and to stop the bleeding was to spend    out of pocket in the emergency room  she did successfully contact the aclu  who intervened on her behalf with the insurance company  they finally  five days after her initial appointment  found a doctor who would remove the iud now  we all know that current catholic doctrine  at least how it s currently interpreted  is that birth control is strictly out of the question  but what about removing birth control  that  apparently  is a gray area  her doctor maybe could have removed the iud without violating policy  but she apparently didn t want to risk it now  to be fair  iud expulsions are rarely dangerous  but they can perforate organs  there are plenty of situations  though  when saving a life could violate religious law  christian scientists don t believe in blood transfusions  any religious person can claim they can t treat an lgbt person  or sometimes even an lgbt couple s children  featured image via flickr
