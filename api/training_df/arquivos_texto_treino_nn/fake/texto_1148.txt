a missouri state representative is making national headlines today after he shared a video on facebook of him decapitating a living chicken to drive home his disgusting opinion about abortion in the grotesque video  gop state rep  mike moon promotes his anti abortion bill while he hangs a live chicken upside down from a tree branch mr  moon then says  when the governor called for the second special session this year  i was right in the middle of my summer job  but like any good career politician  when i get the call  i m going back to work   he happily exclaims as he starts to slice into the neck of the chicken  causing it to writhe around and flap its wings he then proceeds to mutilate the chicken  pulling out its heart while lecturing about the need to protect human lives  god gave us man dominion over life  he allows us to raise animals properly and care for them and then process them for food so we can sustain life  and that s what i m doing here with this chicken  so we ve been called back to this special session for the primary purpose of supporting life  protecting the unborn specifically  i think we need to get to the heart of the matter here  so today  i m filing a bill that will lead to the stopping of abortion in the state of missouri and i hope you ll support it  the springfield news reports that moon s bill emphasizes that missouri protect the right to life of all humans  born and unborn   and to require due process of law before the life of any human  born or unborn  is ended prior to natural death  the national abortion rights leauge didn t think the stunt was very funny and calls moon out for playing  political games  with the healthcare of women  it was insulting watching rep  moon use the rights of women across missouri as some kind of political prop   the organization said   his call to ban abortion is disturbing and dangerous  no matter what he does with that chicken  hopefully  the backlash from this stunt will make mr  moon realize that women deserve access to healthcare  regardless of what he likes to do to chicken in the privacy of his own home feature image via screen capture
