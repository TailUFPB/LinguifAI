once again  donald trump is having a completely disappointing  inappropriate reaction to the racially motivated violence that happened in charlottesville  virginia last weekend apparently  instead of being outraged about the murder of one counter protester and the injuries of several others  trump is all bent out of shape because he has gotten a lot of negative press coverage for his weak  pathetic response to the incident  according to white house officials  trump is coming apart at the seams over this  as robert costa reported  person close to kelly framed it to me this way  potus fuming at press  coverage of c ville handling  in no mood for talk about moderation  seriously  what did trump expect to happen after he ignored america s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days  before issuing a scripted  half ass statement on monday  not even the white supremacists trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism if trump wanted positive press coverage  he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start  speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a president could ask for  and trump failed miserably at executing that  instead  trump protected and defended the racist attackers  making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize trump can blame the media all he wants  but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president  he never does the right thing  even when it is blatantly obvious what actions he should be taking  what happened in charlottesville was an opportunity for trump to emerge as a different president than most americans expect him to be  and he completely blew it  there is something very wrong when a leader cares more about his press coverage than the lives of his constituents featured image via branden camp    getty images
