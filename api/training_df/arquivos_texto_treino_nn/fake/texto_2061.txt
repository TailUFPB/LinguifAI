republican members of congress  who love claiming that they re the only party that stands for real americans  are now terrified of their own constituents  this is happening for one simple reason   they never expected their own constituents to be angry with what they re doing on capitol hill  so instead of facing the music and admitting that the entire gop platform is something americans don t want  they re running scared such is the case with idaho representative raul labrador  his office had the audacity to file a complaint against a group of people made up primarily of senior citizens because they were showing up at his office in lewiston on a weekly basis to voice their displeasure with him and the gop  labrador obviously considers this a threat  and perhaps  if they d threatened violence it would be but that s not what s happening  chris ankeny  the chief of police in lewiston  the idaho town where this is taking place  says these people were protesting in front of labrador s offices and that no crimes had been committed  employees are uncomfortable with them because of the national attention this group had garnered  not because of credible  or even in credible  threats labrador s office contacted the d c  capitol police over this because that force has jurisdiction over u s  congresspeople s offices in addition to capitol hill  they did so because they felt the lewiston department wasn t doing anything  the thing is  a good police department won t do anything when they confirm that there s no crime happening  including threats   so what this is is an office full of people who can t handle dissent the worst part is that this group has so many seniors  and labrador won t hear them  these are people who may be worried about cuts to programs they depend on  including medicare and meals on wheels  others living in and around lewiston are worried about climate change and clean energy  they say labrador s absence from his offices is a sign of cowardice  and they re not wrong  he is a coward many republicans have run away and hidden from their constituents lately because they can t tolerate the fact that their constituents  concerns run counter to the gop s platform  they re too used to putting party above country  maybe this is uncharted territory for them  but shouldn t these guys  who work for the very people they re pissing off  actually stop to listen or are they not what they ve been trying to sell to us it s really disgusting that labrador s office feels so threatened by non violent  non threatening protests from senior citizens that they ve had to file a complaint featured image by gage skidmore  licensed under cc by sa   via flickr
