anybody who says conservatives always treated the obama family with dignity and respect deserve to be smacked hard to jog their memory because ever since donald trump was elected  conservatives have been insisting that we should all unite behind him and treat him with nothing but respect because that s how they treated president obama except that s not how they treated president obama at all  for eight years  conservatives have called him and his family every name in the book  particularly favoring the n word  they also vowed to sabotage his presidency from the very first day  but they have the gall to call for everyone to give trump a chance even though they never gave obama a chance and the complete disrespect of our current president continued during a discussion on fox business  which was about michelle obama s interview with oprah winfrey expressing the feeling of hopelessness that has engulfing millions of americans since since the results came in on election day of course  fox host maria bartiromo and her right wing guests attacked mrs  obama  with morgan ortagus literally demanding her to shut up and smile  you could really hear the disdain in her voice   ortagus opined   people need to understand the american people spoke  the electoral college voted and it s time to move on  and the american people actually decided that it was a repudiation of the past eight years of the type of presidency that barack obama  and the policies he s ensued   but the american people voted for hillary clinton by nearly  million votes so this election was definitely not a repudiation of president obama  it was a demonstration of russian power to meddle in our political process  also  president obama has a higher approval rating than trump but ortagus continued to whine  you didn t hear laura bush saying anything eight years ago  she was gracious  she was classy  she was warm and welcoming to the new first family  and i think that ms  obama needs to take a cue from laura bush and probably just smile and be helpful to melania trump  kevin kelly then chimed in by accusing everyone who have lost hope of being lazy moochers who rely on government for everything ortagus agreed and then treated michelle obama as if she s  the help  what really just irked me about the interview is i thought it was really inappropriate  if i were in her position  i would think she should be helping the incoming first lady  the incoming administration  it s a huge transition for the first family  melania trump has a young son  she had young children  let s focus on the positive and help the new first family transition  it doesn t feel like the other side understands or really cares what the american people just voted for   bartiromo said here s the video via youtube again  donald trump lost the popular vote  so the american people voted against him  furthermore  president obama won both of his elections by far wider margins but conservatives didn t care abut how the american people voted in  or in   they treated the obamas like shit  and even attacked their young children and continue to do so today  so they have no right to whine about how people are treating donald trump  turnabout is fair play  and democrats should treat trump the same way conservatives treated obama featured image  screenshot
