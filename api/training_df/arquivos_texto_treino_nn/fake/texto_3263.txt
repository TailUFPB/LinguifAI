as many of us are slowly  and sadly  coming to terms with the fact that president barack obama has almost completed his final term in the white house  some are making final requests of america s much loved president one of the people who still think obama can save america from trump is retired mit linguistics professor noam chomsky  who recently posted a plea to obama to save undocumented immigrants from the incoming trump administration  in a video message  chomsky said  president obama  to his credit  has issued personal pardons in deserving cases  but he should go far beyond  chomsky was referring to obama s actions on december   when he pardoned  people and gave  prisoners shorter sentences   all of which were non violent  low level drug offenders  during his presidency  obama has pardoned a staggering   individuals   but chomsky urged the commander in chief to go further due to the looming threat of trump  chomsky said  he should proceed to what is  in fact  an urgent necessity  to grant a general pardon to  million people who are living and working   productive citizens  threatened with deportation by the incoming administration  if obama pardoned all those people  trump s promise to deport   million undocumented immigrants would go out the window  and despite trump s flip flopping on his immigration policies  chomsky isn t banking on the president elect being sympathetic or understanding in the long run  bashing trump s mass deportation scheme  chomsky continued  this would be a horrible humanitarian tragedy  and moral outrage can be averted by a general pardon for immigration infractions which the president could issue  peter l  markowitz  a professor at the benjamin n  cardozo school of law  has confirmed that this is actually possible  a few months ago  markowitz stated  president obama can still act to bring humanity and justice to an immigration system notoriously lacking in both  he can do so by using the power the constitution grants him   and only him   to pardon individuals for  offenses against the united states   it s a common assumption that pardons can be used only for criminal offenses  and it s true that they have not been used before for civil immigration violations  however  the constitution extends the power to all  offenses against the united states   which can be interpreted more broadly than just criminal offenses  chomsky said he hoped that obama would listen to his plea and protect those who were vulnerable and in danger of trump s divisive rhetoric  and urged his viewers to join him  chomsky begged  we should join to urge  to carry out this necessary step without delay  you can listen to chomsky make his plea on behalf of undocumented immigrants below if obama does this trump can kiss all of his anti immigration promises goodbye and will have to suffer the wrath of his racist supporters featured image via joe raedle getty images
