it s always interesting when people decide to use social media to point out how ridiculous someone or something is  such was the case with trump hotels  where someone dredged up an old tweet asking people for their favorite travel memories  people angry about trump s muslim ban and other executive orders decided to use that tweet to  ahem  vent  and it s pretty epic people tweeted that their favorite travel memory was staying with a competing hotel chain  others talked about president obama  and still others tweeted about visiting family and friends who are immigrants  still others pointed out hospitality in other countries  or with what overseas airbnbs are doing if trump saw this  he d be pacing back and forth in the white house  grousing about how people need to be reminded of how beloved he is in short  it didn t go very well for trump hotels  but it went amazingly good for anyone who stands against trump and his dangerous  white supremacist agenda  here s the original tweet tell us your favorite travel memory   was it a picture  a souvenir  a sunset  we d love to hear it   trump hotels   trumphotels  october    below is a smattering of responses  trumphotels pic
