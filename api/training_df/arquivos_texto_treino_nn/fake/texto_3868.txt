rep  jason chaffetz  r ut  has such a hate on for hillary that he s going to continue the probe into her emails  despite the fact that the whole debacle only became a massive controversy because the gop was trying to take hillary down before the election  despite millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted on investigating hillary six ways from sunday  it appears that this isn t going away just yet chaffetz seemed to try and make it about a responsibility to find out the truth about the largest breach of u s  security at the state department  but it s not and we see right through him  chaffetz just that full of hate for hillary  what can they really accomplish now with this  what does he hope to accomplish millions of taxpayer dollars have already been wasted on fruitless attempts to find hillary guilty of something  and now he s proven he just can t drop it  i still have a duty and obligation to get to the truth about one of the largest breaches of security at the state department  and foreign hacks aren t massive breaches of security  where are all the investigations into how those are happening  oh  wait  hillary had nothing to do with them  so they re non issues  very tiny  insignificant breaches at worst  if  breach  is even the right word chaffetz has also proven just how terrified he is of looking like a failure  rep  trey gowdy  r sc  already faced possible disgrace after his benghazi investigation was complete  he couldn t prove hillary had done anything wrong there  so even though he won re election  there was a period recently where he looked like a complete failure chaffetz  he s basically saying   we re going to nail hillary to the wall so we can go down in history as the people who finally managed to take down a clinton  that s how this reads  and not everyone is on board  rep  elijah cummings  r md  responded to this with  after everything our country has just been through and particularly given that donald trump and paul ryan have both called for healing our nation s divisions i think the american people deserve more from congress than to continue squandering taxpayer dollars on these baseless republican accusations and partisan attacks  it s time to give it up  guys  this is just absurd now featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
