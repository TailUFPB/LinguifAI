neil degrasse tyson has always put science before politics  sometimes frustratingly so  right after trump was elected  tyson appeared on stephen colbert s show  and rather than opine  he chose to try to comfort the host by saying that when you look at earth from outer space  our problems dissolve  he also said  the politician is representing an electorate  so  really  if you re against a politician  you re against their voter base  fellow citizens of this country   he said   so i as an educator  when i want to educate people  i don t say   don t vote for this person  or  vote for that person   i just simply educate you  so that when the time comes  you can make as informed a decision as you can  now  though  tyson is changing his tone  the trump administration is clearly anti science and it s anti education  for dr  tyson  it s time to speak out   right before protesters across the nation are prepared to march for science  he posted this video to facebook on friday  science is a fundamental part of the country that we are   tyson said   when you have people who don t know much about science standing in denial of it and rising to power  that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy  while tyson was clearly talking about donald trump  anti gmo anti vaxxer  often  liberals were taken to task as well tyson didn t deny that science has a place in politics  once we agree  for example  that humans are causing climate change  we can debate how to fix the problem  but until we agree that there is a problem  we re screwed donald trump s name wasn t mentioned at all during the four minute video  and it didn t need to be  it was clear that tyson was frustrated  dare i say angry   that his career has been so politicized while he tries to stay on the sidelines  tyson is a true hero featured image via joe scarnici getty images
