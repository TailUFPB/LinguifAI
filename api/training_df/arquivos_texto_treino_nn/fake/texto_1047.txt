president obama typically refrains from outright blasting the f ck out of donald trump  but he made an exception on thursday as republicans prepare to strip healthcare from millions of our most vulnerable americans on facebook  obama urged republicans to reject trumpcare and all it has to offer  which isn t much   i recognize that repealing and replacing the affordable care act has become a core tenet of the republican party   obama said   still  i hope that our senators  many of whom i know well  step back and measure what s really at stake  and consider that the rationale for action  on health care or any other issue  must be something more than simply undoing something that democrats did  the senate bill  unveiled today  is not a health care bill  it s a massive transfer of wealth from middle class and poor families to the richest people in america   he continued   it hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries  paid for by cutting health care for everybody else  simply put  if there s a chance you might get sick  get old  or start a family   this bill will do you harm  and small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks  under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach  cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation  that s the key word    meanness   trumpcare is designed not to help americans  but to provide massive tax cuts for the richest americans while leaving the rest of us to suffer  this debate has always been about something bigger than politics   obama added   it s about the character of our country   who we are  and who we aspire to be  and that s always worth fighting for  read the post below  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    our politics are divided  they have been for a long time  and while i know that division makes it difficult to listen posted by barack obama on thursday  june    image via getty images screengrab
