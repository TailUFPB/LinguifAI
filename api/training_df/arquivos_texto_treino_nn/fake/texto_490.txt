ever since the nazi rally in charlottesville  virginia claimed the life of heather heyer  the entire spectrum on the right   from moderates all the way to alt right terrorists   has been scrambling to figure out a way to blame it on the left  that s natural  it was a murder  after all  nobody wants to take the blame for anything bad they re responsible for  let alone the murder of an innocent victim  but donald trump has been especially adept at seemingly calling out radical groups  while never actually explicitly naming the radical group that is to blame it s not like he doesn t know the phrase  alt right   it s in the news every day  he sure as hell knows the word  antifa   that s the  many  in his  many sides  comment after heyer s murder  which he doubled down on two days later  in fact  the word came out of his mouth in accusation at his phoenix rally last tuesday  someone even made a joke about it  pic twitter com   chris stephens   chrisstephensmd  august    only time i can remember trump saying the words  alt right  in reference to charlottesville was in trump tower  what about the  alt left  that came charging at  as you say  the  alt right   do they have any semblance of guilt  as you say so why won t he address the alt right  they are a terrorist group  by any definition  what s more  they identify as christians  persecuted for their identity  justifying their actions with appeals to  us  over  them   that s pretty reminiscent of another radicalized  religious extremist group that feels persecuted  hates outsiders and gay people  treats women like chattel  and uses terror and death to achieve their aims only those guys are brown here in america  though  isis and groups like them   that is to say   radical islamic terrorists    have nothing on white christian males  a joint intelligence bulletin from the fbi and the department of homeland security found that the group we softly label  white supremacists  were responsible for  murders in  terror attacks over the last decade and a half  that s more than any other group in america  that report from two agencies tasked with american safety literally says that radicalized white christian males are the most dangerous people in the country part of trump s unwillingness to name the alt right as the terror group they are comes from their goebbels like effectiveness with propaganda  if they can make it seem like there actually are two  sides  to the conflict that led to heyer s death  and countless other injuries  physical  mental  and personal   they can paint their own side as justified in opposition to it  they achieve this with troll led petitions that seem legitimate  and by posing as members of the left and doing horrible things  remember that kid who would break something  then leave a piece of it in his brother s room so his parents would bust the wrong boy  that s the alt right but the other part of donald trump s inability to name names when it comes to the alt right is simple  they are his biggest fans  and he loves them  terrorism be damned featured image via stephen maturen getty images
