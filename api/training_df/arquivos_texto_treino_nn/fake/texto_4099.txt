donald trump has dragged the republican party so far down the toilet that former republican national committee chairman michael steele won t vote for him during a dinner in san francisco on friday  steele declared that he  will not be voting for trump  because he has  captured that racist underbelly  that frustration  that angry underbelly of american life and gave voice to that  indeed  the republican nominee has aggressively courted the angry white racist vote since the beginning of his campaign  which is why white supremacist groups such as the ku klux klan and neo nazis have flocked to him in fact  steele finds trump s rhetoric do disgusting that he admitted that he  was damn near puking during the debates  but while he won t cast his vote for trump  steele says he isn t voting for hillary clinton either regardless  steele is now the third former gop chair to stand against trump and that s bad news for the republican party and their effort to attract minority voters to the ever shrinking tent  the longer they cling to their new leader  the more and more republicans will be pushed away  and whether they vote for hillary or not  the gop is going to find it almost impossible to make up the difference with their hardcore voters while the republican base is rabid  it just doesn t have the numbers to overcome the loss of more moderate voters who have rejected trump and republican leaders only have themselves to blame  they have been pandering to trump s supporters for years even though racism  sexism  and ignorance are common traits among them  rather than moving toward the center  republicans ended up giving these extremists a seat at the table and have found themselves being pushed out of their own home ever since by fringe conservatives who only want more control  now the party has been hijacked and republican leaders are going to have a hell of a time trying to wrest control back from them that may be possible after a few years  but it s likely that the republican party will be in chaos for many years to come  which means you can bet that more republicans are going to find another party to vote for or they won t vote at all featured image  wikimedia
