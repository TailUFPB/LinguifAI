it is widely believed that gop vice presidential nominee governor mike pence of indiana won the one and only vice presidential debate of the season tuesday night  after all  he was calm and smooth in the face of attack after attack from his opponent  democratic presidential nominee senator tim kaine of virginia  however  there s just one very big problem there  pence flat out lied throughout the debate  well  this is likely something that people are just casual  general election political observers don t know  but  certainly pundits and political nerds knew this right away  and the non partisan fact checking operation politifact was ready to call pence out on his many  many lies  here are just a few highlights pence   hillary clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement  we rated this claim mostly false  in   the obama administration was negotiating with the iraqi government to give american troops immunity prosecution by iraqis   a touchy political issue there s debate on whether the americans could have worked out a deal  but pence is wrong to suggest clinton is to blame  the key decisions and discussions took place between the white house itself and iraqi leaders pence   they want to expand  obamacare  into a single payer program  clinton and kaine have proposed a public option   a government sponsored insurance plan   but they have not proposed single payer  clinton has consistently resisted going in that direction and instead proposes to work to prevent the repeal of obamacare and try to improve on it pence s claim is mostly false pence  donald trump  never said that  more nations should get nuclear weapons mostly false  trump has said some countries  namely japan and south korea  might be  better off  if they were to develop nuclear weapons  given their proximity to north korea  however  he has also said   often in the same interview   that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general pence   we delivered   million in cash as a ransom payment for americans held by the radical mullahs in tehran this  ransom  line  which we ve previously heard from trump  is mostly false  iran received the payment on the same day that american prisoners were released  but experts said this was not ransom  the united states owed iran the money as part of a decades long financial dispute pence   less than  cents on the dollar in the clinton foundation has gone to charitable causes  this is a repeated republican talking point and it s inaccurate  while it s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources  about  percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly and that s just a few  the entire analysis of the truthfulness of the vice presidential candidates  claims can be found here at politifact overall  mike pence had to walk a very difficult tight rope tuesday night  while he might have won when it comes to a calm  cool style  he failed miserably on substance  perhaps that is because when it comes down to it  his running mate is a racist  misogynist  pathological liar and a dangerous demagogue who should never be anywhere near the oval office  to that end  pence s strategy seemed to be to insist that the more outrageous things that donald trump has said throughout this horrific travesty of a presidential campaign aren t true  and to run away from clearly indefensible positions  or maybe he s just drank the kool aid they regularly serve up at trump tower  and actually thinks he is telling the truth and being reasonable either way  it s insanity  thank goodness for fact checkers to help set the american people straight in this nightmare of a presidential election season featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
