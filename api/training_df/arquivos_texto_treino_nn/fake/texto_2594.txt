while republicans seem to be content in keeping a blind eye and sitting on their hands regarding the seemingly extremely obvious violations occurring surrounding donald trump  one democrat is finally stepping up and getting to work on making sure trump s properly investigated according to the house website for congressman jerrold nadler  d ny   congressman jerrold nadler  d ny   senior member of the house judiciary committee  introduced a resolution of inquiry directing the department of justice to provide the house of representatives with any and all information relevant to an inquiry into president trump and his associates  conflicts of interest  ethical violations including the emoluments clause and russia ties  if the house judiciary committee does not schedule the resolution for a markup within  legislative days  it becomes a privileged resolution and can be brought to the floor in front of the full house for a vote  according to nadler  democrats have repeatedly asked the majority  in letters to chairman goodlatte and speaker ryan  to investigate these ongoing conflicts of interest  and those requests have been ignored  adding  donald trump has refused to step away from his business interests in any meaningful way  his foreign entanglements are likely unconstitutional  he has repeatedly refused to disclose his financial assets  and he is clouded by the specter of russian intervention in the election and his administration  republicans have shown zero willingness to follow through on their duty to conduct oversight  and they must be held accountable if they are truly willing to abdicate this constitutional obligation and must be made to answer to the american people for that failure  we must know what the department has learned about the administration s connections to the russian government  we must review the department s legal analysis if there is any of the president s feeble attempt to remedy his wide ranging ethics problems  we must conduct oversight of the least transparent administration in modern history  this resolution represents a start  this resolution is definitely a step towards impeachment in the eyes of many  if trump were to be found in violation of any of the things in question  it can and should be subject to further scrutiny and investigation  subsequently leading towards an impeachable offense s  this is definitely a step in the proper direction  kudos to rep  nadler for getting the ball rolling read more featured photo by chris kleponis pool getty images
