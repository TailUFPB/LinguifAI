trump and his team made a great deal of the campaign about hillary clinton s email security  including gleefully exploiting hacked emails stolen by russia and released by wikileaks   so one might think their own email security practices would be stellar  alas  like so many of trump s criticism of hillary  his team s own security efforts are much  much worse to prove this point  tech site gizmodo created a  test  to see how well trump s staff handles email security  adding even more fuel to the fire  they also included james comey   who had played a central role in perpetuating lies about hillary clinton s emails in the days leading up to the election three weeks ago  gizmodo media group s special projects desk launched a security preparedness test directed at giuliani and  other people associated with the trump administration  we sent them an email that mimicked an invitation to view a spreadsheet in google docs  the emails came from the address   but the sender name each one displayed was that of someone who might plausibly email the recipient  such as a colleague  friend  or family member disturbingly  a number of trump associates fell for it some of the trump administration people completely ignored our email  the right move  but it appears that more than half the recipients clicked the link  eight different unique devices visited the site  one of them multiple times  there s no way to tell for sure if the recipients themselves did all the clicking  as opposed to  say  an it specialist they d forwarded it to   but seven of the connections occurred within  minutes of the emails being sent even more disturbing  both newt gingrich and  now former fbi director  james comey seemed to buy into the premise  while remaining slightly skeptical  comey  for instance  asked the sender to explain to him what was in the attached document  surely a better response than just clicking on it  but still dangerous  by asking a potential hacker to explain him or herself  the  former  fbi director only opened the door to further chances to be hacked  he also appeared to believe the email was really from a friend based solely on the name attached the the email account is it legal to do this  some journalists were skeptical  ashleyfeinberg did did gizmodo send the fbi director a spoofed email and then confess to the federal crime at the fbi director s expense on gizmodo   brian beutler   brianbeutler  may     gizmodo s defense is pretty solid  for starters  they never collected any actual passwords or contact information for any of the recipients  regardless of whether the marks took the bait   secondly  they slapped so many disclaimers on the emails that you would have to be extremely oblivious to not understand what was happening   a test which  it turns out  some of trump s friends seem to have failed for journalistic reasons it provides a lot of insight into just how susceptible some of trump s closest advisers are to being hacked  far from having the moral high ground to lecture democrats  it turns out that trump s team is comprised of technology challenged suckers capable of exposing a lot of sensitive information to would be hackers  if gizmodo can trick them with an email containing numerous disclaimers that this was a potential hack  a real hack   infinitely more subtle   could be a serious threat comey himself acknowledged that it appears russian attempts to hack america s democracy appears to be ongoing and warned that it would likely rear its ugly head in  and   he should be extra cautious meanwhile  it s unlikely that trump will be able to appropriately respond to this threat  he may not even recognize it exists  he talked a mean game about hillary s email security  but the closest he ever came to commenting on his own understanding of cyberwarfare was claiming his  year old son barron was good with computers  given that level of ignorance  trump isn t likely to start leading by example yikes featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
