by his own admission  donald trump is a serial groper who cheats on his wife but that doesn t matter to conservative  christian  leaders  who seem to be the only ones who still support the republican nominee when trump s grotesque remarks about grabbing women  by the p ssy  dropped like a bombshell on friday  republicans rushed to distance themselves from him  conservative  christian  leaders  however  demonstrated that they are true hypocrites by continuing to back trump tony perkins of the family research council said that his  personal support for donald trump has never been based upon shared values   ralph reed of the faith and freedom coalition said that trump s words  rank very low  is his concerns  pat robertson thinks trump is  macho  for groping women and now dave daubenmire is going even further than those other hypocrites the ohio pastor still supports trump because he would rather put a groper in the white house instead of a woman  women and men may be equal  but i think it s pretty clear that the bible teaches us that women should not be in authority over a man   daubenmire said  here s the point i m making  with all that s going on with trump and everybody screaming and hollering about that  when is the last time your pastor stood up in the pulpit and said   hey  listen  we cannot vote for hillary clinton because women are not to have authority over men   if we want to follow the bible  that would sure be a good place to start  wouldn t it  rather than worrying so much about the immorality of a sinful man  what about the biblical principle that when a woman rules over a man   it s a sign of judgment of the lord  here s the video via youtube so let s get this straight  it doesn t matter how many sins donald trump commits  it wouldn t even matter if he is the anti christ or the devil himself  conservative  christian  men like daubenmire are going to still vote for him just because they don t want a woman to be president that s the real reason why conservatives are still devoted to trump  it s  and these so called  men of god  still believe women only belong in a kitchen completely subservient to them  this is the agenda they are hoping to pass under a trump administration  a total rollback of women s rights to the point where women can t vote and cannot even speak without permission from a man  and this is exactly why women should vote against republicans by a landslide in november featured image  screenshot
