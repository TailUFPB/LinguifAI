who doesn t love  weird al  yankovic and his hilarious parodies of famous songs  this time  though  he teamed up with songify to re enact the third presidential debate  poking special fun at two of donald trump s many terrible moments  it also relives some of hillary s most searing burns  and is just all around perfect the song is titled   bad hombres  nasty women   which are two of the quotes that the junkyard heap known as donald trump is most remembered for right now  the video not only features both hillary and trump autotuned to fit the music  but also features  weird al  himself in the role of the moderator the first words of the song  in fact  are   such a nasty woman   from trump  and then hillary joins in with  he choked  he choked  he goes around with crocodile tears   to which trump can only say   such a nasty woman  a little bit later on   weird al  asks the candidates a very important question  to stop a cold war  what should we be doin   would you go thumb wrestle vladimir putin  we have so many adversaries overseas  can we all agree to be frenemies  finally  no song about the third debate would be complete without making fun of the donald s ongoing use of the word   bigly   and  weird al  works it in like the maestro he is  but  perhaps one of the best parts are the expressions on  weird al s  face as hillary and king cheeto answer his questions  watch below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
