frederick douglass and andrew jackson will be very disappointed in donald trump when they learn he fibbed a teensy bit about a civil war battle he says happened on one of his golf courses  according to a plaque   yes  a plaque   trump proudly displays at the  trump national golf club in virginia  the length of the potomac river that borders his course is called the river of blood because both union and southern soldiers died en masse between the  and  holes  the  failing  new york times reported in  between the  hole and the  tee of one of the club s two courses  mr  trump installed a flagpole on a stone pedestal overlooking the potomac  to which he affixed a plaque purportedly designating  the river of blood  many great american soldiers  both of the north and south  died at this spot   the inscription reads   the casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as  the river of blood  the inscription  beneath his family crest and above mr  trump s full name  concludes   it is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the potomac river  the site does have historical significance alongside the bowling green massacre  in that its historical significance is completely made up  no  uh uh  no way  nothing like that ever happened there   said richard gillespie  executive director of the mosby heritage area association  said of trump s claim  gillespie added that the only thing  close to  that was the  battle of ball s bluff in  in which several hundred union solders were killed  it happened  miles upriver  nowhere near the  river of blood  called on his lie  trump attempted to salvage his story by explaining  that was a prime site for river crossings  so  if people are crossing the river  and you happen to be in a civil war  i would say that people were shot   a lot of them  historians say that literally no one has ever died in that crossing  but trump complains that someone might have died at some point  how would they know that   trump said angrily after learning that historians say his stupid plaque is fake news   were they there   trump says  numerous historians  have confirmed the  river of blood   he did not know any of their names  embarrassingly for trump  even golf digest took the time to debunk the blood river sadly  this is not the first mass killing invented by the trump administration  with the bowling green massacre  the atlanta massacre  and that thing that happened in sweden and now the  river of blood   it seems that we may not be able to trust this administration  shockingly  naturally  the internet finds this news hilarious   golfdigest making up a battle named  the river of blood  is creeeeeeeepy   creepyoldpresidentmakingupbattles very creeeeeeeeeeeepy  mr quagmire   mrquagmireusa  may    trumpteacheshistory by commemorating a fictional battle   the river of blood   yeah well  didn t happen   tuesdaythoughts https   t co   atoz     realityshaken  may        golfdigest the hyperbole and bombast of our so called potus   what s next  a bowling green plaque  https   t co   bumblebee   savebeesnow  may    presssec  potus a grammarian s red pencil marking this would make it look like the imaginary river of blood at trump national   vs      may     river of blood  was the result of the  bowling green massacre  where andrew jackson fought frederick douglass and won the civil war  https   t co   limon   limonpoker  may    river of blood was the most tragic loss of life on us soil until the bowling green massacre  https   t co   apophatos   apophatos  may    andylassner  bevvincent  golfdigest trump is on the horn to the ministry of truth to write the river of blood into history books  dissenters are obviously socialist terrorists   robert beyer   cybertbipolar  may    westwingreport  realdonaldtrump the river of blood flows from the bowling green massacre  duh  read up on  alternatehistory  pic twitter com qqmlkpsxhy  k     may    andylassner  fahrenthold  golfdigest many people aren t asking the question  but union and confederate forces retreated to the river of blood after the bowling green massacre         may    jackson and frederick douglass could not be reached for comment on their potential involvement in the battles that turned the river red featured image via screengrab
