anti vaccination advocates were hoping they could continue exposing the general public to diseases that had been largely wiped out by vaccines  but a judge dashed that hope on friday in   california dealt with a months long measles epidemic stemming from a person who was visiting disneyland according to the los angeles times  california residents were believed to have been infected with measles during the outbreak that began at disneyland  as well as at least  people who resided in seven other states  canada or mexico  after visiting the anaheim theme park or catching the virus from someone who went there the outbreak created a health crisis in the state  especially since some schools have immunization rates around  percent or lower according to state epidemiologist  dr  gil chavez measles had been eradicated in america by   but because some crackpot researcher in england published a terribly flawed study claiming that vaccines cause autism  a claim that has been thoroughly debunked by scientists  many paranoid and ignorant parents have decided not to vaccinate their kids  which is why  in  californians who got the measles were unvaccinated  if we had higher levels of immunity in the community  this outbreak would not have happened   chavez said and the risk of exposure was not just in california schools  public health officials contacted thousands of californians in  counties potentially exposed to measles  leading to warnings in airports  malls  schools  clinics and hospitals   the times reported   in one hospital alone  a single person with measles exposed  pregnant women and  infants  including  in the neonatal intensive care unit  after california quelled the epidemic  state lawmakers went to work to make sure such an epidemic never happens again  to that effort  they took particular aim at personal and religious exemptions that anti vaxxers have taken advantage of over the years to decline to vaccinate their kids  they soon passed a law requiring all children to be vaccinated  the only exemption allowed is if the child has a medical condition  such as a suppressed immune system  that would prevent them from getting the vaccine but anti vaxxers threw a hissy fit and filed a lawsuit last month in order to prevent lawmakers from protecting the public health and safety and u s  district judge dana sabraw ruled that they can go f ck themselves and laughed them out of court because state lawmakers have a  long history of requiring children to be vaccinated as a condition to school enrollment  and  plaintiffs have not made a showing that they are entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction  in short  the law will go into effect this year and now every child will be required to be vaccinated if they want to be enrolled and that s a good thing we cannot let irresponsible parents put the public health at risk just because they disagree with science  measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to man and is even more contagious and deadlier than ebola sixteen years ago this country had wiped out the disease within our shores  and all that effort went to waste because some parents listen more to celebrities like jim carrey and jenny mccarthy than they do to doctors and scientists  that needs to change  and this california law is the first step featured image via cbs news
