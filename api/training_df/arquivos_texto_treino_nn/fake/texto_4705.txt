donald trump did an interview with larry king for his program on russia today  a russian network that specializes in putin s propaganda  naturally  trump says it was an  accident   he didn t really mean to go on russian tv  obviously  king tricked him into it  what other explanation could there be a trump spokeswoman told kevin cirilli from bloomberg news that trump was doing king a favor because they are old friends and the donald is such a benevolent soul  naturally  when king asked him to do the interview  the gop nominee assumed that he meant for his podcast   i guess he never heard that phrase about assuming   so it was totally not his fault that he ended up doing the interview for king s show on russian television trump campaign spokeswoman tells me that trump  recorded a short interview with larry king for his podcast as a favor to mr  king    kevin cirilli   kevcirilli  september    campaign spokeswoman says that they thought larry king interview was going to be on king s podcast   not rt   kevin cirilli   kevcirilli  september    campaign spokeswoman tells me that  what larry king does with the interview content is up to him  we have nothing to do with it    kevin cirilli   kevcirilli  september    miller  another trump spokesman  gave the same story and claimed that trump thought he was being interviewed for king s cnn podcast  mr  trump was never told it would be shared anywhere else   miller said trump campaign manager kellyanne conway jumped on the bandwagon during a friday morning appearance on cnn s new day  saying that trump never realized he as being interviewed for the russian network  a former cnn superstar  larry king  has a podcast  and mr  trump went on his podcast  nobody said it would be on russian tv   conway insisted trump has sung the praises of russian president vladimir putin throughout the election and earlier in the week even said that putin is a better president than obama during the command in chief forum during the phone interview  king asked trump what he thought about recent reports that  following the dnc hack  american officials are looking into allegations of russian interference in the u s  presidential election  i think it s probably unlikely  maybe the democrats are putting that out   who knows   trump replied   if they are doing something  i hope that somebody s going to be able to find out so they can end it  because that would not be appropriate at all  featured image via via video screen capture
