the entire trump white house is all about cracking down on leaks that make them look bad  but perhaps kellyanne conway didn t get that memo  at a party on friday night  politico reports that she was overheard making a series of less than savory comments about a few things to reporters  including something trump told her about james comey and whether tapes of his conversations in the white house exist  someone at the party overheard and created a twitter account to document the exchanges the account is called  kellyanneleaks  and the conversations took place at the british embassy during their election night party  one of the things she said  according to  kellyanneleaks  was this she said trump told her to say  jim comey will have to wait and see about the tapes   she added  i chose to convert that to  no comment      kellyanne leaks   kellyanneleaks  june    sounds like trump was trying to get her to intimidate comey on his behalf  because apparently he hasn t already tried that enough already   i chose to convert that to  no comment   refers to her actual statement that she could not comment on the tapes  and that trump wouldn t comment any further  either the white house was not exactly pleased about what comey said to the senate on thursday  and trump himself wasted little time in calling comey a liar while also saying his testimony was vindicating  his lawyer has sent a complaint to the department of justice over comey s  leaked  memo  which just makes their whole position worse  and here s kellyanne conway  admittedly speaking to reporters off the record  but still discussing with members of the press something trump told her that she ultimately refused to say  she and her big mouth may still have gotten trump in more trouble than he s already in she also took aim at white house chief of staff reince priebus  making fun of the way he talks and what he chooses to be upset about she had a good cruel riff mocking   in wh staff meetings   no leaks guuuys  she said  mimicking him in a dopey voice   seriously     kellyanne leaks   kellyanneleaks  june    he should just be honest   i m upset because there s someone working on a story who pronounces it raynse instead of reince       kellyanne leaks   kellyanneleaks  june    funny thing is   kellyanneleaks points out something quite obvious  if trump   co  are serious about cracking down on leaks  they should look a little closer to home than james comey trump pence people are a bit sloppy and fratricidal  what else is new  but if  wonders who the leakers are  https   t co   kellyanne leaks   kellyanneleaks  june    course  after this came out  sean spicer came to conway s defense and says she denied everything  she wasn t making fun of reince priebus  for instance  she was making fun of reporters and the news media about how wrong they tend to get things  yet  according to politico  two other sources confirmed  kellyanneleaks  version of events so she may well have just thrown her boss under the wheels of a bus featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
