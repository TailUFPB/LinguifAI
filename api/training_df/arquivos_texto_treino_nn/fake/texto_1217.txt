it really says something when republican leaders tell trump not to tweet during an important event when former fbi director james comey s hearing was hours away  republicans were rightfully anxious sean spicer may have told the world that trump s tweets are official statements  but we all know it s a circus and spicer s trying to be the ringmaster  the republicans are finally beginning to realize that  oh  i wish he d do something else  it s not going to change the testimony   said senate intelligence committee chairman richard burr  a republican from north carolina  who chaired the comey hearing   source it was no secret that comey would speak unfavorably about trump thanks to comey s opening statement released on wednesday naturally  this meant there was a high chance of trump tweeting and saying how sad and wrong comey is if trump s track record is anything to go by it s clear trump needs someone to hold his hand through his time in office but whether he ll take the hand is up in the air  what i would do is go do my job  let them have their hearing and not give the impression that you re trying to influence it   said sen  jim inhofe  r oklahoma before the comey hearing republican lawmakers are hoping that  if trump can continue to lay low  the commotion of trump s circus will die down a little  then they will be able to focus on trump s agenda again to everyone s surprise  trump didn t tweet during the hearing  or at least  not the trump we were all expecting  instead  we got trump jr  throwing a tantrum on twitter i guess next time  republicans should be specific on which trump should not tweet during important events since they can t figure it out for themselves  honestly it would be in everyone s best interest if trump and his family didn t tweet at all featured image via andrew harrer bloomberg via getty images
