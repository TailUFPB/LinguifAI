donald trump just selected a racist homophobe as the nation s leading law enforcement officer alabama senator jeff sessions is a lifetime bigot who viciously joined his republican colleagues in opposing president obama at every turn  so naturally  he supported trump s campaign and become one of his top cheerleaders who didn t care if trump committed sexual assault or discriminated against black people now sessions is reportedly trump s top pick for attorney general  which would likely set back civil rights for years to come  oh  and sessions is just fine with the kkk according to the new york times while serving as a united states prosecutor in alabama  mr  sessions was nominated in  by president ronald reagan for a federal judgeship  but his nomination was rejected by the republican controlled senate judiciary committee because of racially charged comments and actions  at that time  he was one of two judicial nominees whose selections were halted by the panel in nearly  years in testimony before the committee  former colleagues said that mr  sessions had referred to the n a a c p   the southern christian leadership conference and other civil rights groups as  un american  and  communist inspired   an african american federal prosecutor then  thomas h  figures  said mr  sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that mr  sessions said the ku klux klan was fine  until i found out they smoked pot   mr  sessions dismissed that remark as a joke mr  sessions was also accused of speaking disparagingly of the voting rights act and the stringent oversight it placed on southern states so we can expect sessions to ignore civil rights laws as attorney general since he will likely direct the justice department to turn a blind eye towards civil rights violations across the country  thus giving racists the opportunity to treat minorities however they please  it s going to be a racist free for all it also likely he will refuse to stand in the way of republican efforts to suppress minority voters while fighting anti discrimination laws tooth and nail make no mistake  trump s justice department is going to be full of racists and sessions will be the top racist in charge featured image via wikimedia
