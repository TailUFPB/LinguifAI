donald trump has not even taken office yet and he has already pissed off the most populous nation on the planet for nearly  years  the united states and made it policy that the american president does not contact the leader of taiwan for the sake of stable relations with china but donald trump violated that policy on friday by talking to taiwanese president tsai ing wen china does not recognize taiwan as an independent nation and considers the island its territory  this goes all the way back to  when chiang kai shek evacuated his nationalist forces to taiwan after being defeated by communist forces in the chinese civil war china has refused to recognize taiwan ever since and considers it a renegade territory trump claims that the phone call was merely congratulatory and that both sides expressed that  close economic  political and security ties exist between taiwan and the united states  but if you believe that  i have a golden tower to sell you  most likely  trump is getting cozy with taiwan because his company wants to build luxury hotels and resorts on the island  which is yet another conflict of interest trump has refused to deal with and is more proof that trump only wants to use the presidency for his own selfish financial gain trump s action has been criticized by diplomats and state department personnel  and his recklessness has now drawn an angry response from the chinese government in a statement  the chinese foreign ministry lodged a formal protest and warned trump to beware of risking relations between our two nations again   it must be pointed out that there is only one china in the world   chinese officials said   we urge the relevant side in the us to adhere to the  one china  policy  abide by the pledges in the three joint china us communiques  and handle issues related to taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall china u s  relationship  again  trump has not even taken office yet and he is already screwing up decades worth of established foreign policy  proving once again that he is too irresponsible to be president china is a major holder of u s  foreign debt and is a major manufacturer of products sold by american businesses  so pissing the chinese off could not only lead to a war  it could substantially cripple our economy donald trump serious needs to read the relevant intelligence and foreign policy briefings so he doesn t do anything stupid like this again featured image  drew angerer getty images
