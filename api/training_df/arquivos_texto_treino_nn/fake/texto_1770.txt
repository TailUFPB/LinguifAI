joe biden once again demonstrated why the american people love him so much during her confirmation hearing  betsy devos was grilled by the senate  her lack of qualifications and opposition to public education made it clear that she should not be the secretary of education  but her family has bought politicians over the years so it s surprise that she had enough republicans in her pocket to narrowly get confirmed one of the big questions devos refused to answer was about sexual assault on college campuses  under the obama administration  title ix was interpreted to also mean that colleges must work to stop sexual assault on campus  when asked about this  devos balked  senator  i know that there s a lot of conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance   and if confirmed i would look forward to working with you and your colleagues and understand the range of opinion and understand the issues from the higher ed institutions that are charged with resolving these and addressing them and i would look forward to working together to find some resolutions   devos said after being pressed to answer  devos replied   it would be premature for me to do that today  after being confirmed  she finally answered the question by revoking the guidance set up by president obama and declared on the department of education website   this is an issue best solved at the state and local level  in other words  devos is perfectly happy to continue letting rape culture continue on college campuses  she won t lift a finger to help women and that makes joe biden angry  it bothers me most if secretary devos is going to really dumb down title ix enforcement   biden told teen vogue   the real message  the real frightening message you re going to send out is  our culture says it s ok  you know  the major reason why women drop out of college when they re a freshman is because of sexual assault  not their grades  sexual assault  and so  it would be devastating  biden went on to slam devos for enabling rapists and said parents should not have to worry about safety on college campuses no father or mother should drop their kid off this late august  early september at their first day at college and drive away worried  going to be safe  parents don t drive away saying  is she going to do all right in school  is she academically qualified  will she show up for class  how well is she going to do  that s not the conversation going on  the conversation that s going on is  is she going to be safe  that is an obligation of the school  and title ix is the vehicle  and when secretary devos by her silence didn t affirm that rape and sexual assault are forms of sexual discrimination  god  if anything is sexual discrimination  it s rape and assault  and that s why schools have an obligation under title ix to prevent this from happening indeed  parents should only have to worry about how well their daughters will do in school  not about if some asshole is going to violate their bodies by ignoring sexual assault on college campuses  betsy devos is part of the problem  and when young women are raped and the rapists get away with it  devos should be held responsible  she is in a position of power to do something about this and if she won t do it she should be dragged into court alongside the rapist featured image  mark wilson getty images
