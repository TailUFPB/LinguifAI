unable to spew her toxic bullshit on various media outlets  kellyanne conway appeared on right wing radio instead republicans have conveniently ignored the fact that they obstructed president obama for eight years  and that includes a nearly year long refusal to grant supreme court nominee merrick garland a fair confirmation hearing  republicans even blocked one obama nominee so long that she died waiting to serve her country so every time republicans complain about democrats obstructing trump  they are being hypocrites and conway was a whining hypocrite during an appearance on hugh hewitt s radio show on tuesday and failed to disagree with hewitt after he compared president obama s appointees to terrorists  i just want him to do  there are sleeper cells of obama appointees throughout this government who are in political jobs   hewitt said  they re not civil servants  and i want them  i really want them gone yesterday  hewitt wants donald trump to just fire all of obama s appointees  which would leave several positions unfilled as the senate continues to hold hearings for trump s nominees hewitt then asked conway if trump will use recess appointments to fill all of the government posts in one shot  a dubious appointment method that republicans repeatedly warned president obama against doing  would you push that  because we ve got to stand up to this government  and senate democrats are not going to do anything to assist us in getting going   hewitt said not only did conway fail to call hewitt out for comparing president s obama s appointees to terrorists  she admitted that trump could pull the trigger on recess appointments  which would allow hundreds of nominees to fill posts without confirmation by the senate  everything s on the table   she said  all of that is being discussed  hugh  and you make some excellent points  you re right about the democrats  i mean  to see sort of congenital  presumptive obstruction and negativity is very concerning  because it just means that the government can t function fully  and that they re obstructing regardless of who the individual is that s being considered  regardless of the post that needs to be filled  and it s very frustrating  gee  that sounds a lot like what republicans have been doing over the last eight years  except that democrats are obstructing because trump is picking nominees who are unqualified the hypocrisy here is absolutely unprecedented  if president obama had immediately fired every appointee of george w  bush  republicans would have screamed bloody murder and the fact is that as much as republicans are whining about democratic obstruction  turnabout is fair play  if republicans wanted democrats to work with them they should have thought about that before treating president obama the way they did over the last eight years  from the very first day of president obama s administration  senate republicans vowed to obstruct him  they refused to cooperate with him on anything  and now that the same thing is happening to them  they have no right to complain and they only have themselves to blame comparing democrats to terrorists is totally un american and just demonstrates that democrats have a duty to continue obstructing donald trump and his extreme conservative agenda  and by not disputing hewitt s comparison  conway just demonstrated why she should never be allowed on television again featured image via screenshot
