the congressional budget office released their assessment of the gop s obamacare replacement bill on monday and the news was worse than many had even feared  according to the analysis of the nonpartisan group  the american health care act would result in  million people losing their healthcare within the next ten years talking points memo reports that in response to the cbo report  the american medical association denounced the republicans  make america sick again bill as  unacceptable  if this bill were to become law  cbo projects  million americans who have gained coverage in recent years could lose it in   for the ama  that outcome is unacceptable   the group said on monday the ama made their opposition to the ahca crystal clear last week  in a letter written last tuesday  the group said there was no way they could  support the ahca as drafted   because of  the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations  critically  we urge you to do all that is possible to ensure that those who are currently covered do not become uninsured   the ama begged lawmakers the cbo assessment estimated that of the  million people who would lose their insurance over the next decade   million would find themselves without coverage before the end of the year  when the number of people already uninsured is combined with those who would lose their healthcare under the ahca  a total of  million people would have no coverage by   today s estimates from the nonpartisan congressional budget office underscore the ama s concerns about the ahca as it is written   the ama said the ama conceded that the affordable care act was admittedly  an imperfect law   but they said there was no way to deny that obamacare was  a significant improvement on the status quo at the time  the ama believes we need continued progress to expand coverage for the uninsured  unfortunately  the current proposal   as the cbo analysis shows   would result in the most vulnerable population losing their coverage  under the ahca  the elderly and disabled would be hit with higher premiums than their younger  healthier counterparts  this means that they would also be the most likely to be unable to afford coverage even though they are the ones whose lives depend on healthcare the most featured image via joe raedle getty images
