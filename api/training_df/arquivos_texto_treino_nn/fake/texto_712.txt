donald trump just beat bill clinton at something  and it s very embarrassing the first six months of trump s presidency has been a humiliating failure the scandals  the investigations  the legislative stalls  the infighting  the firings  the whining  and the incompetence have all resulted in an approval rating that is the worst in american history the ongoing and ever growing russia scandal has contributed most to trump s woes as it has engulfed him and many members of his administration and family  including jeff sessions  donald trump jr   and jared kushner but when newsweek took a look at how trump s approval ratings compare to bill clinton s during his own scandals  the publication discovered that trump s numbers are even more humiliating in   republicans attempted to impeach president clinton for having an affair with monica lewinsky and lying about it under oath  the scandal rocked washington for months as conservatives salivated over the prospect of ousting clinton and embarrassing democrats  needless to say  the story was national news for months but clinton s sex scandal was not nearly as scandalous as trump s collusion with russia during the  election is  that s because trump s scandal violates our democratic process and is considered treason against the country never before had a foreign nation colluded with a candidate s campaign to help them win the presidency but that s what happened as trump jr s own emails demonstrate  as trump s russia scandal deepens and the investigations get closer to the truth  trump is panicking and is desperate to kill the investigation the scandal has resulted in a record low approval rating of  percent  according to the latest gallup poll and that number is far lower than anything clinton received at the height of his own scandal newsweek pointed out that clinton s scandal hit national airwaves on january     clinton s approval rating  however  climbed to  percent by the next month  and it would remain above  percent the rest of the year throughout the spring and summer months  the scandal dominated cable news and headlines but clinton would not see his approval rating dip below  percent  and come august   gallup s three polls showed ratings of    and  percent even after the impeachment trial  clinton s approval rating never fell below  percent  trump began his presidency with  percent  and it has only continued to dip clearly  americans care more about the integrity of the democratic process than they do about an extramarital affair this is not something that trump is going to brag about  in all likelihood  trump will seethe over this until he explodes in rage on twitter  something else that has revolted americans since he took office but trump only has himself to blame  his campaign colluded with the russians and trump has spent a lot of time lying about it and trying to obstruct the investigation when and if trump does get impeached  he won t have the support of the american people like clinton did  they will be cheering for his end featured image via win mcnamee getty images
