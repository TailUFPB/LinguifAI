trump has repeatedly decried the gun violence that plagues the city of chicago  along with other republicans and nra types who claim that chicago is proof that gun laws only serve to create more bloodshed  yet  here is jeff sessions  creating a program to give more federal manpower to  cities to help them combat violent crime and chicago isn t one of them the  cities are the absence of chicago and another city with a huge violent crime problem  baltimore  is a bit surprising  earlier this year  donald trump compared chicago to afghanistan in terms of being a war zone  and threatened to  send in the feds  if chicago officials were unable to stop the bloodshed  he also blasted the chicago police department for  not doing the job  maybe they re not gonna have to be so politically correct  maybe they re being overly political correct  maybe there s something going on  but a doj report blistered the cpd over its use of excessive force and routine violations of the constitutional rights of residents  this is particularly true for chicago s black and latino residents  furthermore  chicago s mayor  rahm emannuel  has repeatedly asked for more help from the federal government to combat these problems there s one worrying thing about this plan  too  are doj officials going to work with these cities to develop broken windows policing techniques  that doesn t work   it just leads to a higher incarceration rate for ridiculously minor crimes  it also disproportionately targets the black community  making it an inherently racist policy in the end  though  if chicago is such a god awful mess  and they want the help  then why wouldn t the doj put chicago on this list  it s always possible that these  cities are testing grounds  however  it s also possible that they think they don t need to prioritize chicago right now because they already sent  agents from the the atf  and are considering reallocating federal prosecutors a spokesman for the doj says that more cities will be added later in the year  the cities on this list will not receive more federal funding  per se  but they will receive agency experts and employees to work with their governments on developing strategies for how to best fight violent crime featured image via scott olson getty images
