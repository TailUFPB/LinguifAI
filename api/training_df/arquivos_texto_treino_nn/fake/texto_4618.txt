sometimes you ve got to laugh   especially if you re the democratic nominee  who is currently facing down a level of unbridled hatred that rivals all previous presidential candidates with the exception of barack obama  recently  hillary contracted pneumonia   or  if you listen to our friends on the right  she s on her deathbed and completely unfit to serve as president because reasons  the downright comical reaction to this  coupled with the numerous right wing anti hillary witch hunts like benghazi and the manufactured controversy over her emails  is enough to give one a chuckle   but it s even more fun when one of the ignoramuses who subscribe to such ridiculous notions stops by one of her rallies to tell the democratic nominee how he really feels about her as hillary spoke to a crowd in greensboro  north carolina  a heckler screamed  f ck hillary  hillary s reaction was priceless  as the crowd cheered for her and  hillary  chants broke out  a grin formed on the face of the former secretary of state  quickly turning into a chuckle then a full blown laugh  now  i just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs   she said after the moment passed  going back into her speech like nothing happened as the heckler was escorted out interestingly  she didn t order her supporters to attack the man  she didn t lash out  she didn t insult him  she respected his right to display a dissenting opinion  this is something you would never see at a trump rally  where the  nominee s  basket of deplorables  regularly beat protesters   especially the elderly and minorities   senseless for expressing themselves vote for the candidate who can keep her cool in november   the future of our nation depends on it watch the incident below  featured image via screen capture
