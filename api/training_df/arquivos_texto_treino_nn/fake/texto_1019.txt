trump got into a bizarre pissing match with former president obama during his interview with fox news  for reasons known only to him  trump decided to admit that he does  in fact  think the republican healthcare bill meant to repeal obamacare is  mean  and accused obama of  using his term obama  actually used my term  mean  that was my term   trump  on fox  confirming he called house health care bill  mean  in private mtg  brian stelter   brianstelter  june    is a pretty stunning admission coming from the guy who celebrates the passage of the  mean  bill by a highly publicized rose garden ceremony and speech just to remind ourselves  here was trump just weeks ago when republicans in congress rammed through the ahca without support of democrats  the congressional budget office  or the american people  notice his giant grin  photo by mark wilson getty images former president obama recently joined millions of americans in condemning the bill  along with its equally vicious counterpart in the senate  which seems to have bugged trump  it s long been noted that obama s popularity and reputation infuriate trump who has neither   and knows it  watching obama label the bill  mean  was apparently enough to get trump into full on jealousy mode  even though it makes him look like a monster  trump needed the country to know that he came up with the word  mean  to describe his own bill faster than obama  he wins after his confession  trump went on to claim he would like to see a bill  with heart  get passed  he doesn t expand on what that would look like  he also doesn t explain why he is ferociously supporting the republican healthcare bill   which even many republicans believe will be a complete disaster  healthcare experts have taken it even further  arguing the senate bill  in some ways  is even meaner than the house s version  they took a bad bill and somehow made it worse trump s interview on fox was meant to be a softball lobbed over the plate so he could hit it out of the park  the conservative network  long operating as a talking point factory for republicans  has been reduced to the role of  state media  in trump s america  this was never going to be anything but an opportunity for trump to promote himself and his agenda  instead he confessed on cable television that he thinks his own healthcare bill is evil you can t learn that kind of stupid  that s all natural featured image via cnn
