this election is already the nastiest one on record in american political history  the aftermath could end up being the bloodiest if trump supporters follow through on their threats  if she s in office  i hope we can start a coup   trump supporter dan bowman declared at a rally earlier this month   she should be in prison or shot  that s how i feel about it  we re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes  there s going to be a lot of bloodshed  but that s what it s going to take i would do whatever i can for my country  bowman is not alone either  many trump supporters are simply waiting for trump to give the word on election day  like this person who aimed a gun at hillary while she was on television during the debate this all stems from trump s assertion that the election is rigged for hillary clinton and that  second amendment people  should do something to stop her and right wing radio hosts like joe walsh are only throwing gas on the fire  november   i m voting for trump   the disgraced former tea party lawmaker wrote on twitter before adding   on november   if trump loses  i m grabbing my musket  you in  on november   i m voting for trump on november   if trump loses  i m grabbing my musket you in   joe walsh   walshfreedom  october    an interview with cnn on friday  walsh claimed that he was merely calling for  civil disobedience  if i wanted people to take up arms  why would i recommend people take up an antique like a musket   walsh told chris cuomo   i mean  seriously  in  i want people to go out and find a musket  grab their musket  that s just silly  but that doesn t explain why he said everyone should grab their guns if trump loses  a musket is  in fact  a gun and definitely implies that people should grab their guns in fact  walsh doesn t even care if trump loses fair and square  he still wants people to revolt against the government with their guns  if she wins fair and square  then the anger that a lot of americans have toward our political system   and she s part of that   we ve got to double down and triple down and do whatever we can to defend our freedom  that phrase   grab your musket   is a phrase i ve used probably a hundred times in the last two or three years  cuomo didn t let walsh get away with trying to spin his own words  however  the cnn host reminded walsh of another tweet he posted in the wake of the killing of police officers in dallas  words matter  context matters   cuomo pointed out   you say   this is now war  watch out obama  watch out black lives matter punks  real america s coming after you   you only take this one way   you take it provocatively  trump is the master of this  and you have to now argue whether that s a good thing or a bad thing  you tell me why it s good  walsh then dropped his  civil disobedience  spin and went straight to talking about grabbing guns and going to war against the federal government  which would be treason  look  when i say   grab your musket  man  and let s go to war if hillary wins   the republican party s going to be in our sights  because all these people are pissed off again at what we believe  chris  is a corrupt political system  here s the video via twitter former rep  joe walsh  when i said grab your musket if trump loses  i meant we need  to defend our freedom  https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  october    supporters are dangerous threats to public safety and our democracy  this nation s government needs to be prepared for the strong possibility that right wing nuts will attempt a bloody coup or commit acts of violence wherever they are in the country in retaliation of a hillary victory  that means president obama should put the military and national guard on standby  if these idiots want a war  let s see how they do against professionals who have actually been in one featured image  screenshot
