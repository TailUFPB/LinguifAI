we re all used to seeing insane  nonsensical tweets from donald trump sr  the so called  president   however  now that it is his son and namesake  donald trump jr   who is in the hot seat at the moment over the weekend  the new york times dropped several bombshells regarding a shady meeting with a russian lawyer that trump jr   first son in law jared kushner  and former campaign manager and kremlin toadie paul manafort engaged in during the height of the  presidential campaign  the whole thing resulted in trump jr  eventually admitting that the whole purpose of the meeting was to get dirt from the russians on democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton after all of this  it seems that trump jr   is following in his father s footsteps and watching coverage of himself on cable news  as rep  adam schiff  d ca   the ranking member on the intelligence committee in the house of representatives was making an appearance on morning joe  trump jr  was tweeting about what he was talking about with hosts joe scarborough and mika brzezinski and their guests  obviously irritated  trump jr  said of course  this is just the sort of thing his father would tweet when the news cycle is focused on something unsavory regarding this travesty of a  presidency   therefore  it should come as no surprise that jr  is doing the same thing  after all  the whole family seems like some kind of crazy  children of the corn carbon copy of their crazy father the walls are closing in and they don t know what to do  the free press is still operating and speaking truth to power  despite the constant bullying of this autocratic  kleptocratic administration  they know it  too   after all  if you want to see desperation in action  just check the twitter feeds of donnie   and donnie    the more aggravated the tweets  the better things are for the nation featured image via david becker getty images
