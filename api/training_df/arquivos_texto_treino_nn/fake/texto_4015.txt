republican presidential nominee donald trump has made life a living hell for party leaders since he first began to rise in the polls way back in the overcrowded gop primary season  against all odds  trump s bombast and demagoguery wooed disaffected gop base voters  and he managed to steamroll past other established  much more qualified republican presidential candidates  in the interim since then  trump s controversies have caused many issues for party leaders who have been forced to try to defend and vouch for their nominee  the worst instance of this  of course  was the infamous access hollywood tape in which trump had a lewd and offensive conversation with billy bush well  since that tape caused condemnation across the board   even causing many leading republicans to withdraw their endorsements  the result was a well publicized and fiery civil war within the gop writ large  now  with just  days to go until election day  the trump campaign is making an effort to hold the party hostage  and force support for the embattled trump pence ticket  an email  obtained by the washington post  was sent around to gop elected officials  which read  i know we are less than  days to the  election  but it is imperative that we continue to drive republican support for the top of the ticket  that means we need your direct  strong support for the trump pence ticket  now is the time  no waffling  no week  knees  we strongly urge you today to make a statement   take a stand   and step out for the trump pence ticket  so  in other words  this is a  support trump or else  message  trump himself has already floated the idea of punishing party leaders such as house speaker paul ryan for disloyalty  especially since some of these people are only supporting trump because they are forced to  now  team trump is essentially holding the gop hostage  and if their demands are not met  make no mistake   the consequences will likely be dire hopefully these republicans don t cave to trump s insane  strongman like tactics  and can show a bit of spine and limp on to election day featured image via alex wong getty images
