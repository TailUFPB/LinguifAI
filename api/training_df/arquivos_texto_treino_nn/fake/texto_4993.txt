donald trump just got fined    for improperly using the atrium of trump tower for campaign events  which violated an agreement between trump and the city that is meant to preserve public space the public atrium of trump tower was repeatedly closed for the republican nominee s campaign events  which ultimately resulted in an investigation by the new york city department of buildings  in new york city  it is common for buildings to have public atriums  this is done in an effort to preserve public space as developers continue to build office and residential buildings larger and larger in june of this year  trump couldn t be bothered to take the time out of his busy schedule to show up for a court hearing about a bench that was removed from the atrium of trump tower  as a result  he was smacked with a    fine according to the wall street journal  the bench in question was part of a public space agreement between trump and the city in january  the city ordered trump tower commercial llc to remove two trump store kiosks from the atrium of trump tower  one of these two kiosks sold campaign merchandise and accepted donations to trump s campaign the new york city department of buildings issued a statement regarding the    fine the building owner removed kiosks and replaced a bench that s required to be in the atrium  however  the owner must still pay the    penalty levied earlier this year trump certainly seems to have a hard time following rules  as a narcissist  he tends to think that he is above the law and that the rules don t apply to him  he truly believes that he can just do whatever the hell he pleases  but it looks like the city of new york thinks otherwise  unfortunately  it is unlikely that even a    bill will help that message to sink in featured image via joe raedle getty images
