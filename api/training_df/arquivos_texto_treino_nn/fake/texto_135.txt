every other day there seems to be a new mass shooting  it s barely over a month since the massacre in las vegas and we now have the deadliest mass shooting to take place in a house of worship  a gunman opened fire on a church in the tiny town of sutherland  texas  and at least  people are dead  including children and including the shooter this is a developing story  but at the time of this posting law enforcement had not yet released information on the shooter other than the fact that he was killed  they also aren t reporting a possible motive   they say right now the shooter s motive is unclear  regardless  donald trump has already responded to it on twitter may god be w  the people of sutherland springs  texas  the fbi   law enforcement are on the scene  i am monitoring the situation from japan   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    response is that of a classic racist  and here s why  as soon as we heard about the killing in new york city at the hands of someone shouting  allahu akbar   trump s first response was this in nyc  looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person  law enforcement is following this closely  not in the u s a    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    must not allow isis to return  or enter  our country after defeating them in the middle east and elsewhere  enough   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    he sent his condolences to new york city  and after he did that he went on another rant about islamic terrorism i have just ordered homeland security to step up our already extreme vetting program  being politically correct is fine  but not for this   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    terrorist came into our country through what is called the  diversity visa lottery program   a chuck schumer beauty  i want merit based   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    are fighting hard for merit based immigration  no more democrat lottery systems  we must get much tougher  and smarter    foxandfriends  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    migration must end now  some people come in  and they bring their whole family with them  who can be truly evil  not acceptable  pic twitter com pqgettdrtx  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    united states will be immediately implementing much tougher extreme vetting procedures  the safety of our citizens comes first   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    terrorist was happy as he asked to hang isis flag in his hospital room  he killed  people  badly injured   should get death penalty   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    love to send the nyc terrorist to guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    there is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed  should move fast  death penalty   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    ll wait with bated breath for him to demand reviews of all our gun laws in the wake of this shooting  if it turns out this was an angry white guy with a gun  like it was in las vegas and like it has been in multiple other mass shootings of this nature  we won t hear anything else except more  thoughts and prayers   that s ironic considering these people were already in church and were presumably people of prayer featured image via mark wilson getty images
