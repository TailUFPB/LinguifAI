the city of flint  michigan is suffering through a horrible man made disaster that could have been easily prevented if state republicans hadn t been so careless after placing flint under state control  officials chose to save money by switching the city s drinking water from lake huron to the flint river  which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption as a result  the city has been devastated by lead poisoning  which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water understandably  flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court  but because michigan republicans and governor rick snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice  they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping flint of the power to sue according to the detroit free press though flint has not been under a state appointed emergency manager since april   the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five member receivership transition advisory board  whose members are appointed by gov  rick snyder the board moved quickly to change the rules under which flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state appointed board this is absolutely outrageous  it s like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose ceo raped her michigan republicans should not have the power to take away anyone s right to seek redress through the court system  it sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case  and frankly  they should be after all  it was their decisions that led to flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover up that followed  the city of flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court  but republicans took that power away from flint  and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way featured image via mark wilson getty images
