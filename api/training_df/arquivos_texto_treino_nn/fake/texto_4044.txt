it s fox news  but that doesn t mean that everyone is blindly following donald trump  anchor megyn kelly fell off the trump train right about the time of the first republican presidential debate of the season  after which trump accused kelly of having  blood coming out of her eyes  blood coming out of her wherever   all because she dared ask about trump s history of sexism it s been more than a year since that debate  and in that time  trump the sexist has come front and center  especially after trump was caught on a hot mic  saying that he likes to grab women  by the pussy   and to confirm trump s own words  nearly a dozen women are now accusing the self described billionaire of sexual misconduct kelly  when interviewing trump surrogate newt gingrich  suggested that trump is a  sexual predator   at that point  the interview went off the rails  gingrich became very angry and said to kelly kelly responded in the best way possible   i m not fascinated by sex  but i am fascinated by the protection of women and what we are getting in the oval office  every woman knows that when a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex   he s not saying it in a way that means she d be welcome in trump s locker room   not at all  when a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex   especially in an argumentative context  he s calling her a whore  while that statement might not have the same bite in  that it might have had when gingrich was young  the intent is there  gingrich is trying to discredit kelly in the exact same way that trump is trying to discredit his alleged victims  a woman liking sex is still used as a defense in rape trials  while men grabbing pussy  or talking about grabbing pussy  is just boys being boys  women talking about sex is taboo and any woman who dares talk about sex deserve whatever they have coming to them believe it or not  that exchange was the most rational part  in the now familiar trump tactic of  i know you are but what am i   gingrich went on to call bill clinton a  sexual predator   he even tried subtly bullying kelly into  say ing  the words   bill clinton sexual predator   kelly went on to say that on her show  they ve covered the bill clinton story and that she s interviewed kathleen willey  who has accused clinton of rape  an accusation for which a grand jury found insufficient evidence  here s the video gingrich has a grudge against clinton  to be sure  if you recall  the former speaker of the house was one of architects of the clinton impeachment  which only served to boost clinton s popularity while it seriously hurt congress s ironically  gingrich and the other two speakers who presided during the impeachment investigation and trials  were all sexual predators  dennis hastert molested boys while a wrestling coach in illinois and bob livingston had a string of affairs  gingrich was cheating on his second wife  before that  though  gingrich earned the title of sexual predator  at least that s what he s accused of one former aide describes approaching a car with gingrich s daughters in hand  only to find the candidate with a woman  her head buried in his lap  the aide quickly turned and led the girls away  another former friend maintains that gingrich repeatedly made sexual advances to her when her husband was out of town  on one occasion  he visited under the guise of comforting her after the death of a relative  and instead tried to seduce her  in certain circles in the mid   gingrich was developing a reputation as a ladies  man source  salonoh  and he also served his first wife her divorce papers while she was recovering from cancer surgery  yes  he and trump are a perfect match
