public pressure is mounting on congressional leaders after donald trump issued his racist  xenophobic  and idiotic executive order  the order  signed on friday  bars refugees  immigrants or green card holders from entering the united states if they come from iraq  syria  libya  somalia  iran  sudan and yemen shortly after the issue  plans arriving across the united states  busiest airports carrying syrian families  international students  and dual citizens were met with hostile authorities  either sent back on the next flight out  detained for hours on end  and belittled by federal agents  muslim refugees were subject to the wrath of donald trump at first  only the democrats  not surprisingly  spoke out  but as public outcry grew into spur the moment rallies across the united states  republicans were forced to take notice senator susan collins of maine  a centrist who refused to support trump during the campaign  spoke out first  saying in a press release the worldwide refugee ban set forth in the executive order is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic   could interfere with the immigration of iraqis who worked for american forces in iraq as translators and bodyguards   people who literally saved the lives of our troops and diplomats during the last decade and whose lives are at risk if they remain in iraq  as i stated last summer  religious tests serve no useful purpose in the immigration process and run contrary to our american values nebraska senator ben sasse  who refused to endorse trump  lambasted the administration for lacking  wisdom  with the action there are two ways to lose our generational battle against jihadism by losing touch with reality  the first is to keep pretending that jihadi terrorism has no connection to islam or to certain countries  that s been a disaster  and here s the second way to fail  if we send a signal to the middle east that the u s  sees all muslims as jihadis  the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that america is banning muslims and that this is america versus one religion  both approaches are wrong  and both will make us less safe  our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdomarizona senator jeff flake  who sits on the senate foreign relations committee and also refused to endorse trump  blasted the executive action as  unacceptable   saying president trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security  but it s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry  enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear eyed view of radical islamic terrorism without ascribing radical islamic terrorist views to all muslim arizona s other  and more hawkish  senator  john mccain  took to facebook to denounce the order  joining with senator lindsey graham  writing ultimately  we fear this executive order will become a self inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism  at this very moment  american troops are fighting side by side with our iraqi partners to defeat isil  but this executive order bans iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in arizona to fight our common enemies  our most important allies in the fight against isil are the vast majority of muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred  this executive order sends a signal  intended or not  that america does not want muslims coming into our country  that is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security when you ve lost john mccain  you know there s a problem  although the sentiments expressed by the senate republicans are accurate and reflect what should be shared by   of their caucus  their words come a little too late  it became apparent that trump s chief adviser  steve bannon  had his grubby  racist little hands all over it  rudy giuliani admitted on fox news that donald trump knows this is a muslim ban   he wanted one in the most  legal  way possible  yet he continues to insist it is not a muslim ban what the republicans also fail to note  or admit  is that the ban is just flat out racist it s a good start  nut statements won t do a thing  it s time for them to come together with the democrats to pass meaningful legislation and send a real message to the trump white house featured image via win mcnamee getty images
