the dominoes continue to fall as new evidence comes out saying that jeff sessions really did lie through his teeth about his meetings with russian ambassador sergey kislyak  sessions claimed he didn t discuss anything about the trump campaign  but kislyak reportedly told his own government that wasn t true  according to the washington post ambassador sergey kislyak s accounts of two conversations with sessions were intercepted by u s  spy agencies  which monitor the communications of senior russian officials both in the united states and in russia  sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the trump campaign  a former official said that the intelligence indicates that sessions and kislyak had  substantive  discussions on matters including trump s positions on russia related issues and prospects for u s  russia relations in a trump administration well  gee  we can t imagine why on earth sessions neglected to mention his meetings with kislyak on his sf   that was supposedly at the instruction of the fbi investigator conducting his background check  but it doesn t matter who did or did not tell him to do it  he still omitted a foreign contact who just happened to be russian but remember back in march  when he said this as he recused himself from the russia investigation  i never had meetings with russian operatives or russian intermediaries about the trump campaign  ha  nope then in january  he literally said he d never had any contact with the russians at all  when called out for that  he said that he misunderstood the question about his foreign contacts during his senate confirmation hearing  so his lies evolve as new information comes out while u s  officials cannot assert that what they learned about kislyak s conversations with the kremlin are  percent accurate  they now have something new to dig into when it comes to jeff sessions and his true ties to russia recusal from the russia probe is no longer enough  it really never was   sessions now appears to have done everything he claimed he never did  including discuss trump s position on russia while the campaign was still going on  not only is lying or deliberately omitting information on the sf  illegal  but he discussed matters of foreign policy as a member of a presidential candidate s campaign  that is also illegal  and it makes trump look even worse as far as collusion goes how will sessions and trump try and spin this  sessions should resign immediately featured image via alex wong getty images
