donald trump and his favorite daughter  ivanka  are still getting a lot of heat for the stunt they pulled at the  summit in germany last week  the entire world was shocked when trump stepped out of the  meeting and ivanka took his seat and sat in for him at the leader s table   a move that earned trump and his administration a massive amount of criticism and outrage while most of the country was disgusted that ivanka  who was not elected or qualified  was allowed to sit next to the attending world leaders  trump and his daughter found refuge on fox news  outnumbered  who passionately defended their favorite dictator and his daughter  ignoring the fact that this was highly inappropriate  fox news  jason chaffetz and the rest of the outnumbered panelists were more than happy to defend it  chaffetz said  ivanka trump  she is part of the administration  she does have her father s ear  she can actually get things done  and they were talking about a topic in which she s personally engaged  i think it was wholly appropriate  if that wasn t ridiculous enough  the segment was made far worse by harris faulkner  who actually said that ivanka was qualified to be at the  meeting because her products were  hot online   faulkner said  it must be so frustrating for democrats not to have any low hanging fruit  they re grasping now  they re really grasping  she is there in a capacity of someone who has run a very successful corporation and her items are selling by the way  hot online  it really does not get any dumber than that   especially considering that ivanka s brand has seen a major decline since her father s presidential campaign and failing presidency ruined the family s name and reputation  fox news has been known to shamelessly promote trump and his family  but this is just embarrassing you can watch fox news defend trump and ivanka below featured image via sean gallup   getty images
