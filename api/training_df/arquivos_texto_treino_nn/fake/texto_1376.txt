according to an associated press source  michael flynn is going to decline to honor the senate intelligence committee subpoena and refuse to testify at wednesday s hearing  flynn was asked to appear before the committee  and to produce documents detailing all of his conversations with russia  instead  he will send a letter to the committee today informing them of his plans to refuse to testify washington  ap    ap source  michael flynn to decline senate intel committee subpoena  invoke  amendment later today   zeke miller   zekejmiller  may    addition to the senate intelligence committee  flynn is also the subject of a federal grand jury which has issued subpoenas to his close associates earlier this month even though flynn will refuse to talk  the evidence against him is mounting  flynn registered as an agent of a foreign country after his firing  which indicates that he s taken money from overseas in return for lobbying  flynn was also caught lying about his connections with russia to the vice president  which apparently caused him to be fired after  days of deliberation documents showing communication with russia  as well as flynn s first hand testimony of what happened behind the scenes  would be an enormous help to senate investigation flynn will definitely be the first trump pardon   christopher hayes   chrislhayes  may    it appears likely that michael flynn is prepared to keep his mouth shut in order to protect his former boss  donald trump  there is little downside for flynn in any case  under the law  he cannot be charged for refusing to testify against himself  the rules regarding flynn s unwillingness to provide documentation that may incriminate him are similar  so he is unlikely to face additional prosecution  like any decent criminal  michael flynn is clinging to the fifth amendment  no need to incriminate yourself  the evidence will do it for you  aiden wolfe   aidenwolfe  may    april  flynn s lawyers put the word out on twitter that nothing would secure his cooperation except for full immunity  but that may not be necessary to build a case against the administration despite his persistent refusal to produce the requested documents or testify in his own defense  prosecutors reportedly feel pretty good about their chances of getting flynn to open up  the federal grand jury probe is in the process of producing evidence that will make flynn s testimony unnecessary  trump   pleading the fifth amendment makes you look guilty flynn   i plead the   vinay a  ramesh   vinaytion  may    the record  investigators think that they can get flynn to crack and tell everything he knows once he s faced with evidence of his wrongdoing  photo by win mcnamee via getty images
