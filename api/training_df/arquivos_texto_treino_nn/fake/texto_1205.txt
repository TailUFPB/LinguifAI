donald trump has been having a rough time lately and things came to a head on thursday when james comey testified before congress regarding the  president s  attempts to obstruct justice  judging by friday s press conference  it seems that things are really starting to get to trump during a press conference with romanian president klaus iohannis  trump completely melted down on live television  he debated out loud whether to call on  one of the killer networks  who are so mean to him with their  fake news  and finally called on the washington times  dave boyer and warned him to be nice boyer asked trump about comey s testimony  wondering if there really are tapes that could settle the whole obstruction of justice matter  trump responded just as you would expect him to no collusion  no obstruction  he s a leaker   trump said he then implied that comey had committed perjury  lying to congress about him while under oath  frankly  james comey confirmed a lot of what i said  and some of the things that he said just weren t true   he said  seemingly wanting it both ways  trump denied comey s accusation that he had pressured the fbi director to drop the investigation into mike flynn s russian ties and asked him to pledge loyalty  but he added that it would have been okay to do even if he had  which he hadn t   insert eye roll here  boyer then asked the  president  if he would testify under oath to tell his side of the story and trump said that he would be   percent  willing to do so  but the rest of trump s answer was enough to make the entire country do a collective facepalm i hardly know the man  i m not going to say i want you to pledge allegiance  who would do that  who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath  i mean think of it  i hardy know the man  it doesn t make sense  no  i didn t say that and i didn t say the other for the record  it was at this point that everyone sitting in the room watching the press conference with me screamed   you  at the television  trump also promised that we would be hearing more about the alleged tapes in a  short period of time  trump is losing it  his temper tantrums on live tv just prove that his tenuous grasp on reality is slipping under the pressure featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
