it s hard to imagine that donald trump could give america any more reasons why he shouldn t be the country s next president  but trump just can t help it  when he s not offending minorities or destroying our relations with our countries  trump is coming up with more shady excuses about why he can t release his tax returns  even after his own vice president  mike pence  said that they would both be releasing their tax documents however  in a joint interview yesterday  trump and his running mate seemed to be changing their story once again  ignoring the fact that everyone from hillary clinton to prominent republicans to even his own supporters have begged the business mogul to release his tax returns  trump had the nerve to tell abc news  david muir that no one cares about his tax returns  he said  i think people don t care  i don t think anybody cares  except some members of the press  and not surprisingly  pence slightly walked back his comment about trump releasing his tax returns  he must have gotten yelled at by his boss  and told muir that he d meant only after they were audited  and that  this is all a distraction  once again  trump gave the ongoing audit of his taxes as an excuse  despite the fact that parts of trump s audit have been completed and the irs has said trump could release them  not to mention  many former presidential candidates have released their tax documents while under audit   it s not a big deal  unless you have something to hide bragging that he s given  most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics   trump continued  when the audit is done  i ll release them  i don t know when that s gonna be  it could be soon  it could be not  how comforting  so much for the transparency and trustworthiness he s trying to build with american voters  you can watch the interview below trump to  davidmuir   people don t care  about whether he should release his taxes https   t co mdccpdaqefhttps   t co   this week   thisweekabc  september    again  trump is ignoring even the advice of his own supporters who understand that every time he acts out or does something shady to hide his past  he s basically handing the election over to clinton featured image via ralph freso   getty images
