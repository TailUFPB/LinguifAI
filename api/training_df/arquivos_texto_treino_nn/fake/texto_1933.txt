a study was just released that said that conservative politicians are better looking than their liberal counterparts  and the reason for it shows that liberals are better at picking leaders the study  published in the journal of public economics  and performed by researchers at the university of helsinki  examined politicians and academics from europe and the united states  the fact that left leaning scholars are perceived as better looking is no cause for alarm   prof  jan erik  l nnqvist said   what is worrying  however  is the high degree of importance attached to looks in political elections  he added   the results of my study are in concordance with other studies that show that the effect of attractive looks is twice as large for politicians on the right compared to their counterparts on the left  while it did not find that conservative academics were better looking  conservative politicians won the overall beauty contest and believe it or not  that s likely how we got donald trump hear me out  no  while trump is expert at leering at and sexually harassing beauty contestants  there s no sash in his future  so  what does trump s election have to do with conservatives being more attractive people  conservative voters  it seems  are shallow people  they are less capable of getting past the superficial and understanding nuanced campaign issues  now are you getting the connection to trump or  as dr  l nnqvist suggested  one possible reason for the greater influence of looks on right wing constituents could be that they are less informed  previous research has also shown that conservative voters have a more concrete  perhaps less sophisticated way of thinking  that is probably why the nation is in much better hands with democratic presidents  it also might show why democrats have a harder time winning  our views are much more complex  as is our taste in candidates  republicans campaign on bumper sticker slogans and democrats campaign on issues  it s much easier to rally people around bumper sticker slogans than around complicated ideas featured image via win mcnamee getty images
