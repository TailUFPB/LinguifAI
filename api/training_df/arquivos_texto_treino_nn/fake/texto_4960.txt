it s no secret that team trump has a problem with minorities   and that is putting it kindly  despite trump s recent attempts to fake caring about black people by speaking to black voters in a mostly white wisconsin suburb  it couldn t be more clear that it s all just an attempt to save face  well  now  one black trump adviser has actually admitted what we already knew  the trump camp couldn t give two shits about minority outreach sean jackson leads the black republican caucus of florida  and somehow he thinks that trump actually likes black people  jackson actually blames trump s campaign staff rather than the great orange racist himself for the abysmal polling results when it comes to african american voters  jackson says  mr  trump really does have a sincere  passionate interest in black outreach  but his campaign staff has dropped the ball  i have been saying repeatedly that you cannot go into a black community in the ninth hour of a campaign and ask them to vote for a gop candidate  the party has done a piss poor job of courting the black vote over  years  so you have to have more vested interest in time and in your financial effort for the whole campaign  not just in the last  days  well  mr  jackson  you got one thing right here  the gop has done a piss poor job of reaching out to black voters for decades  there s a reason for that  though  the party is full of racists  that s just the truth  but being a black republican yourself  i suppose that you either refuse to see or choose to overlook that fact  just a couple of examples  to remind you  house majority whip steve scalise is the number three ranking republican in the house of representatives  he also once bragged to a reporter that he is  quote   david duke without the baggage  then you have rep  steve king  who literally floated white supremacist theories on live television during convention coverage  and that s just two examples  we won t even get started on just how racist the donald himself is wake up  man   donald trump and the gop don t give a damn about black people  they just want our votes  and you ve fallen for their line of bullshit hook  line  and sinker featured image via ralph freso getty images
