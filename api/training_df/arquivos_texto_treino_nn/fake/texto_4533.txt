this should come as no surprise to most of us  but trump supporter don king let the  n word  slip out during a recent speech in an ohio church  it s also unlikely that you ll be surprised at the fact that trump was sitting right behind him  smiling with glee when it happened trump loved hearing the  n word   screenshot cnn commentator angela rye spoke about this terrible incident with a trump supporter  and the racism behind the trump campaign got even worse  when rye asked white trump surrogate joseph borelli to  please tell me that you understand  how offensive it was to use the  n word  in   she didn t quite get the answer she was hoping for  in fact  it was the exact opposite  the white panelist basically said that since rappers use the  n word   it s fair game for don king and everyone else  borelli said  have you not listened to music where other african americans use language far worse than this  rye couldn t believe her ears  and gave borelli a chance to save himself as she begged   please don t do that to me  please don t do that to me  today  and of course  the dense trump supporter didn t take the hint  i am going to do it  though  you can t say that don king is saying a word that is now suddenly unacceptable  it s not one that i would use  but it s perhaps a word that don king would use  that s when rye went off and tore him a new one  in making her point  rye warned   what i m saying to you  is this trivializes your candidate s black outreach  you can watch rye shred borelli below  corporatebarbie metroadlib rt  keithboykin    angelarye for the win   donkingpic twitter com   thanks for asking     september    also didn t hesitate to point out the fact that trump was smirking during the  n word  heavy speech  which will undoubtedly create more trust issues with african american voters   angelarye on trump surrogate using the n word during a minority outreach event https   t co   eugene scott   eugenescott  september    image via screen capture
