the white house s official website used to have lengthy pages on several topics  including climate change  the aca  lgbtq rights and civil rights  among other things  the instant the clock struck noon in washington  though  trump and his admin furiously began scrubbing the site of pretty much everything they don t like obama once had a very long and detailed page dedicated exclusively to fighting climate change  which is an issue that s growing in importance   was once the hottest year on record  now  is the hottest year on record  in other words  the planet is heating faster and faster  according to real science  but trump and his administration still seem to think climate change is either a hoax  or it s a nuisance to be destroyed otherwise trump wouldn t have appointed scott pruitt  a lying climate denier as head of the epa  which he also happens to be suing  or was  scientists have been scrambling to preserve as much government climate data as possible in recent weeks  downloading everything to a network of servers in canada where herr trump can t touch it  and now their fears that trump wants to squash talk of man made climate change are starting to play out trump s only mention of anything having to do with the environment is his  america first energy plan   that plan is committed to rolling back epa rules and expanding fossil fuel operations because that s obviously the magic bullet we need for jobs  energy growth and the environment  the truth was spoken by a coal miner who  on dec    blasted any ideas that we can actually bring coal jobs back to coal country to smithereens  where once there was a fount of information  a search for  climate change    global warming   and anything along those lines on the white house s site suddenly reveals a whole lot of nothing   it s completely normal for whitehouse gov to change rapidly with an incoming administration  but it doesn t appear to be customary to scrub all references to absolutely everything the incoming administration has been sneering at the whole time motherboard s jason koebler made this all the more ominous by saying  scientists i ve spoken to who are archiving websites say they expect scientific data on the nasa  noaa  department of energy  and epa websites to be neglected or deleted eventually  they say they don t expect agency sites to be updated immediately  but expect it to play out over the course of months  this sort of low key data destruction might not be the type of censorship people typically think about  but scientists are treating it as such  do we really have to wonder whether trump will try and censor all climate change information everywhere  no  we really do not featured image by alex wong via getty images
