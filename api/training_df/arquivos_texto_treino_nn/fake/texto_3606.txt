it s funny how trump kept screaming that the election was rigged all through his campaign  and now screams there s massive voter fraud everywhere considering that the three states that gave him the white house are getting ready to recount their votes  lawyers for trump are mobilizing to block recounts in michigan and pennsylvania in a panic  trying to stop these efforts  wisconsin s recount is already underway  so good luck there michigan s recount is set to begin today  yet trump believes that any recount in that state would be  lawless   despite the fact that recounting election votes is as american as hot dogs with ketchup at the ballpark  his complaint could stall that recount until it becomes impossible to do it  and that s probably his goal  the board of canvassers is scheduled to discuss trump s specious claims today in pennsylvania  trump s attorneys accused jill stein of  commandeering pennsylvania s electoral process  with an eye toward doing the same to the electoral college   they go on to say that there s no evidence of fraud or tampering  and imply that the recount shouldn t happen because of this  indeed  one judge has blocked recount efforts in one part of the state  but it s not clear what the state itself will do what are they so afraid of  seriously  trump himself alleged massive voter fraud  and his minions have glommed on to that absurd narrative  but they won  they won the white house  so what s the problem here  if anything  they ought to be celebrating these recounts because they should believe such recounts will just reinforce the legitimacy of trump s win is it the anomalies in wisconsin that s scaring the living demons out of him  perhaps it s his shrinking margin in pennsylvania that s got him terrified  following philadelphia s final tally  trump s lead shrank from roughly   to   votes  that could be scary  or maybe it s the fact that michigan agreed to a recount despite the fact that the state only uses paper ballots hillary is now down by less than   votes across all three battleground states the problems in all three states could be enough to worry him  if he were any kind of classy  though  he d tell them to go ahead with their recounts  and he d have his people tell the press and anyone else who will listen that he s confident these recounts won t reveal anything new that should be obvious  but what s truly obvious is that trump is scared that the recounts will show he lost  whether they actually will or not remains to be seen  but he and his officials are making complete fools of themselves by contesting the recounts like this featured image by mark wilson via getty images
