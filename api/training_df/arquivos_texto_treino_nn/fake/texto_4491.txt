ahead of tomorrow night s debates  where hillary will have an abundance of facts  figures  experience and knowledge at her disposal while trump will only have misogynistic insults and outright lies at his  a fox host is complaining that television is home to reverse sexism  why because men can t condescend to women on tv  and that s just not fair wah wah wah someone bring the guy a tissue before he blows his nose all over the women he s working with  bill hemmer was speaking with jessica tarlov about the debate  and tarlov said she feels it s absolutely appropriate for hillary to criticize trump s misogyny and racism while onstage  when tarlov began listing specific examples of trump being racist and misogynistic  she said   i could go on  obviously   to which conservative lobbyist matt schlapp said   you are  hemmer cut in with  we work in television  and i ve always thought that when a man and a woman is on television  a woman can be sarcastic or even  perhaps  a little condescending toward a man and it s okay  but a man can never do that to a woman and get away with it  watch below while hemmer s logic might sound reasonable on the surface  here s why it s not  reverse oppression  racism against whites  sexism against men  discrimination against straight  cisgender people  etc   doesn t exist because oppressors can t suddenly become the oppressed  oppression  particularly by straight  white  cis  christian men  is woven into our society  it s insidious  and while yes  men can experience prejudice and stereotype  our society is built by men  for men  prejudice and stereotype are not the same as oppression it s not about one person being an asshat to another  which is what hemmer is really whining about and equates with so called  reverse sexism   when schlapp responded to tarlov s litany of trump sins with   you are   he was putting her in her place  not arguing her point  that is sexist  that s relegating her and her arguments into the background as irrelevant on the basis of her gender  not the merits of her argument as a woman  tarlov can t send a man back into the background because he s not in the background to begin with  as she is  that s just the way it is since hemmer works for fox noise  though  it s only natural that he probably won t even attempt to understand this as far as trump and the debates  hillary won t be putting trump in the  man s place  when she calls him out on his sexism  racism  etc  she can t   but he can try and put her in her place and he does it all the time  she s calling out fundamental flaws in trump that make him unsuited to lead a country that desperately needs its oppressive structures torn down  he  on the other hand  will build on those very structures featured image via screen capture from embedded video
