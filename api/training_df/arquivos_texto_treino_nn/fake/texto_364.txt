about a month ago  donald trump shocked the country by responding to a violent white nationalist rally in charlottesville in a way that was completely vile  defending white supremacists and stating that  both sides  were responsible for the violence  americans across the country were horrified that such a racist message could come from the president of the united states  and now  some areas of the country are standing up to it california is now sending a strong message to trump and his administration in response to the horrific endorsements trump has given to white supremacists  the lower house of the california legislature has just passed a resolution that is demanding that congress censure trump so that the undeserving potus is clear that we will no longer tolerate his behavior  assembly member tony thurmond said  the leader of the free world can t continue to use language that legitimizes the actions of extremists groups that promote hate  congress must exercise its power to check the president by voting for his immediate censure  while a gop dominant congress likely won t censure trump  this initiative marks the first attempt to censure a sitting president since    and that should send a strong message  the hill also reports that california is trying to get other states to join them in similar ways  demanding that trump should  publicly apologize to all americans for his racist and bigoted behavior  this bill follows trump s own resolution in which he tried to condemn the attacks in charlottesville  however  he continues to fall short with his weak statements  refusing to denounce the specific hate groups that are responsible  trump instead spoke against racism in all forms   here s trump s weak  spineless statement  we condemn the recent violence in charlottesville and oppose hatred  bigotry  and racism in all forms  hours before  trump had doubled down on his horrendous  both sides  comment  stating that counterprotesters were also to blame  you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also  when you look at really what s happened since charlottesville  a lot of people are saying and people have actually written   gee trump may have a point  that is seriously disgusting  for that statement alone  trump deserves the treatment he s getting from california featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
