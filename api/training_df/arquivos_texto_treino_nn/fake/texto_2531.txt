it s mind baffling that donald trump still hasn t learned not to make stupid comments on twitter  especially since people like model chrissy teigen are always sure to fire back with some seriously epic burns during the campaign  teigen was an outspoken supporter of democratic candidate hillary clinton and made sure to shoot trump down on twitter whenever she could  now that trump is in the white house  teigen has decided to turn it up even more   and the donald isn t going to like it  following general michael flynn s resignation last night  trump took to twitter this morning to whine about the  illegal leaks coming out of washington    and he s going to wish he hadn t it was a tweet that seriously lacked self awareness  considering that just last weekend trump held an impromptu national security meeting with japanese prime minister shinz  abe right in front of dinner party guests  while teigen didn t bother pointing that out  she made sure to remind trump that everyone hates him  she fired back  this is what happens when your staff hates you  beyonce s staff are more leakproof than yours  ouch  twitter loved teigen for pointing this out  because beyonc s team has been known to be tight lipped  having somehow kept a wedding  pregnancy and major albums completely secret in the past teigen is right   trump appointed several untrustworthy  unqualified people and now he s suffering for it  it is insane that just three weeks into his presidency  one of his administration members is resigning  the chaos and confusion  as well as overwhelming disapproval from the american people  has been unprecedented  and trump seems to only make things worse for himself every time he complains about it on twitter  there will always be people like teigen who aren t afraid to hit back and expose trump for the moron he is   and we should be thankful for them featured image via michael buckner and joe raedle   getty images
