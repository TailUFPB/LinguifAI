using a pimp for pedophiles as a witness is something only a sleazy and desperate lawyer would do but former nyc mayor and trump supporter rudy giuliani did it anyway during an appearance on cnn to defend donald trump against accusations of sexual assault and jake tapper was quick to burn him for it from the start  it was clear that giuliani is a hypocrite because while he absolutely believes the women who have accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct  he refuses to believe the women who have come forward to say the the republican nominee sexually assaulted them  so far  nine women made such claims about trump  but giuliani thinks they are all liars  do you believe every one of these women is lying   tapper asked  no  i believe my friend donald trump when he tells me he didn t do it   giuliani replied   i ve never seen him do anything like that  well  of course you haven t  rudy  you ve only been kissing trump s ass since april  trump has been groping women for decades as a private citizen giuliani then conceded that he hasn t investigated the women s claims but he attacked jessica leeds in particularly by bringing up an alleged witness to the alleged groping on an airplane in the   there is an independent witness who says it s not true   giuliani declared triumphantly but a disgusted tapper crushed giuliani s attempt to defend trump by pointing out that anthony gilberthorpe was a self claimed pimp for pedophiles who delivered underage boys to british politicians  hardly a credible witness and certainly not the kind of witness an attorney worth their salt would want on the stand tapper then cornered giuliani about his support of the women who have accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct  noting that donald trump has paraded these women around and continues to talk about sexual assault even as his surrogates complain that the media hasn t moved on to covering something else hypocritically  instead of answering tapper  giuliani did just that and complained about the media and insisted that they move on from focusing on the sexual assault allegations against trump  in fact  giuliani was so desperate to stop talking about the sexual assault allegations that he rambled on and on for the remainder of the interview about other stuff trump has talked about here s the video via youtube donald trump should have to answer for these allegations all the way through election day and so should his supporters  these are serious accusations that have a lot of credibility considering trump has openly bragged about groping women whenever he wants even if they don t want him to do so and trump has only made things more difficult for himself by bringing in bill clinton s accusers and trash talking the women who have come forward against him republicans have also made this more of a story by continuing to support trump despite his comments and behavior so really  the only one giuliani should blame for the media circus surrounding trump is trump himself but again  that would require giuliani taking his lips off of trump s ass first featured image  screenshot
