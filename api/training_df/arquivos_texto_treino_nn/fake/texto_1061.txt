in a move that will most likely never be described as  progress   the state of missouri has voted to pass sb   a bill that among other controversial and oppressive laws  would permit employment and housing discrimination against women who use birth control or choose to have an abortion  the bill passed by the senate tonight is a good start   will scharf  policy director for missouri governor eric greitens  wrote on twitter   looking forward to seeing how the house can substantially improve it to protect life  the main reason behind sb  is to impose more restrictions on abortion providers in the state  such as requiring them to send fetal tissue samples to a pathologist within five days  the pathologist then having  hours to respond  currently there are no deadlines  but despite the bill being supported under the guise of women s health  requirements such as this serve absolutely no medical purpose whatsoever  furthermore  the move will just impose more costs  both monetary and bureaucratic  on abortion clinics  ultimately forcing them to eventually close down  which was the goal all along but there are even more disgusting  farther reaching repercussions of sb    the bill overturns a st  louis ordinance that prevented discrimination from employers and landlords against people based on their reproductive health decisions  to put it bluntly  if the bill is passed  women could be fired or evicted in missouri for having an abortion  using contraception  or becoming pregnant while unmarried the ordinance that was passed in february had its share of opposition  archbishop robert carlson released a statement criticizing the passing of the ordinance as  a terrible moment for a city with such proud history   adding the laws of the city of st  louis now actively protect and promote the killing of unborn children  thomas buckley  general counsel to the archdiocese  said the ordinance  promotes religious discrimination against those who don t want to be complicit in the evils of abortion   he then took it a step further  saying the archdiocese will not and cannot comply with this  we will go straight to federal court  that is not far removed from what they did  and they won  soon in missouri if an employer has a problem with a female staff member s use of contraception  which is about   of sexually active women between the ages of    their employment could be terminated and landlords could even deny them a home featured image via alex wong getty images
