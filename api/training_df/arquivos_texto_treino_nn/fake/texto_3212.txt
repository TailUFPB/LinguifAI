when most presidents in the past have sent a message leading into the new year  they ve sent messages of hope  unity  and a better tomorrow  clearly  president elect donald trump is not trying to be like any former leader trump s new year s eve message  sent via his medium of choice   twitter   went something like this  happy new year to all  including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do  love  happy new year to all  including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do  love   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    narcissistic message was clearly not about the nation or bringing us to together in any sort of way  but instead throws over half the nation under the bus however  if one were to redact most of trump s tweets and just leave the intro and the close  it would sound something like this  happy new year to all  love  redacted  trump sounds just like obama    pic twitter com   sarah wood   sarahwoodwriter  december     quite honestly  sounds like someone who wants to unite the nation and move forward towards a better tomorrow  it actually sounds remarkably like the president we ve had for the past eight years  president barack obama if only trump could contain his narcissistic animosity towards those who don t like him or agree with him  however  his fragile ego doesn t seem to make that possible thus his constant twitter fits of rage against anyone who dare speak against him redacted trump could actually be a good leader  unfortunately  he doesn t seem to know how to edit himself for the greater good  hopefully that will change featured photo by chip somodevilla  twitter getty images
