alex jones of the conspiracy theory website infowars has made a literal career of spreading fake news and acting like a lunatic  it now seems that said career has come back to really bite him in the ass  since jones just lost a court battle with his wife regarding which parent is most fit to raise their children  after more than nine hours of considering the merits of jones  case  a jury returned  giving the estranged couple joint custody of the three children  despite having joint custody  though  jones  ex  kelly jones  will have most of the power prior to this battle  alex jones had the kids living with him  with their mother s rights being severely curtailed  she was only allowed supervised visits before  the reasons for this are unclear  she said tearfully to the press  i m so blessed to have such a wonderful support system and i just pray that what s happened to my family that people can understand what parental alienation syndrome is and get an awareness of it so we can stop this from happening to others  a lawyer for kelly jones  robert hoffman  said of alex jones  mr  jones is like a cult leader  and we ve seen the horrific damage cult leaders do to their followers  indeed he is  alex jones whips his paranoid  ignorant followers up into a frenzy and makes them believe all kinds of tomfoolery  he has promoted the idea that the sandy hook elementary school shooting never happened  that   was actually carried out by the united states government  and all kinds of other craziness  and his rabid audience believes every word of it  definitely  such a person should not be influencing children   at any rate  it is good to see that jury made the right choice here  and hopefully kelly jones can undo whatever damage her estranged husband did to those poor children featured image via screen capture from infowars
