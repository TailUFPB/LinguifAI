the trump campaign is hopping mad over an unaffiliated super pac that used the lure of a dinner with donald trump to take in over   million from unsuspecting trump groupies  the super pac  american horizons pac  set up a website at dinnerwithtrump org and told trump fans that their donations would enter them into a drawing to eat dinner with the reality tv star and republican presidential candidate in reality  the drawing   set up by  year old ian hawes  simply offers tickets to an already existing fundraiser for trump  there is no guarantee that the winner would get to actually meet trump  a stipulation hidden on the website in very fine print furthermore  documents filed with the federal elections commission by the pac showed that much of the money being donated is going to a company affiliated with hawes  and not to trump or other republican candidates  it is the latest in what has been described as a  scam pac  that is so prevalent on the right the trump campaign has now issued a cease and desist letter  attempting to stop the pac  you are knowingly defrauding every person who gives you his or her email address or who makes a donation through your unauthorized website   reads a letter from trump s campaign attorney  donald mcgahn  to the super pac the pac was able to take advantage of the fact that trump and the republican party have been woefully unprepared for the election  they haven t spent much of the money they ve received on tv ads or organizers in key states  nor have they clearly indicated a preference for a super pac for well heeled republicans to donate to  as a result  these fly by night pacs have sprung up and using advertising on facebook  google  and cable news  mostly fox news  they are able to tap in to angry trump voters who think they re donating to help the donald and take down hillary clinton like so much associated with trump  it s turning into a mess featured image via flickr
