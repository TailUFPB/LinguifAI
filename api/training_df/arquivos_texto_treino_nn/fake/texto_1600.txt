today  fbi director james comey sat down with congress to talk on a wide range of scandals plaguing the trump administration  it was part one of a two part series of testimonies likely to destroy trump s chances of ever pretending russia didn t help him get elected or that he didn t know the people he staffed in the white house were rife with conflicts of interests   former acting attorney general sally yates is up next  and it promises to be a doozy  comey started off by emphatically stating  again  that the intelligence community has clear evidence linking russia   and russia specifically   to interference with the election  calling russia the single biggest threat to american democracy  he didn t mince words  he also denied trump s latest frantic attempt to cast doubt by debunking the white house s claim that it was probably china  comey stood by the intelligence community s conclusions  this was russia but comey s most powerful moment came when he was asked by sen  al franken to explain why russia wanted trump over hillary clinton in the first place  what was the point  he wasn t hillary clinton  who putin hated and wanted to harm in any possible way   comey says on why russia had a preference for trump pic twitter com xycqotjhng  cbs news   cbsnews  may    point  according to comey  was two fold  by every shred of information the intel community has  it s clear that russia s autocratic ruler vladimir putin despises hillary clinton  he s had a beef with her stretching back to her time as secretary of state where she routinely stood up to his plans of expansion  he also blamed her state department for stirring up democratic protests against him by the russian youth fed up with putin s iron grip on their country   like trump  putin often blames legitimate protests against his rule as caused by outside agitators   in short  according to comey  putin wanted vengeance against clinton for being tough on him and trump was the way to do it it also ties into comey s second conclusion  russia figured trump  ignorant as he is  would be much easier to pull one over on  comey put it slightly more generously  putin believed he would be more able to make deals  reach agreements with someone with a business background than someone who had grown up in more of a government environment  putin wasn t wrong  before the election was even over  his campaign was secretly promising putin that they would ease up on sanctions  trump would later appoint rex tillerson  a man with very close ties to russian oil companies and putin himself  to secretary of state  russia got nearly everything they wanted on november    none of this is good news for trump  having lost the popular vote by millions  trump also has the distinction of being the least popular new president in history  he has a credibility problem  comey s testimony only makes it clear that his illegitimacy problem extends internationally  whether he coordinated with russia intentionally or whether he was a useful stooge for putin to exploit  remains to be seen  what is clear is that the fbi has every reason to believe russia was celebrating trump s win as hard as any  make america great again  trump voter and sally yates has the second in the one two punch coming next week featured image via cbs
