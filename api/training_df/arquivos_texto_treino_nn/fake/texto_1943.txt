while the house intelligence committee s investigation into russia s interference in our political process is a mess  the senate intelligence committee is busily working together to conduct their own investigation in as impartial a manner as possible  and today s open hearing revealed a kicker  russia s meddling with the u s  government did not stop with the  election it s actually still going on clinton watts  a senior fellow at the center for cyber and homeland security  said  this past week we observed social media campaigns targeting speaker of the house paul ryan hoping to foment further unrest amongst us democratic institutions  he went on to tell the senate intel panel this  they were in full swing during both the republican and democratic primary season   and may have helped sink the hopes of candidates more hostile to russian interests long before the field narrowed  sen  rubio  in my opinion  you anecdotally suffered from these efforts  cnn acknowledges that today s hearing may well not be anything like as explosive as james comey s statement to the house that the fbi is  in fact  investigating trump for possible collusion with russia during the election  however  this hearing is focused on russia s disinformation campaign  which vice chairman mark warner said was a deliberate attempt to undermine our elections yesterday  both warner and richard burr  the committee s chairman  said that the committee had an unprecedented number of documents from congress   gang of eight   which usually severely restricts access to just such information  the senate intel committee is busy trying to learn as much as it can before it calls in high profile witnesses such as paul manafort  carter page  and even jared kushner and michael flynn they have a list of  witnesses they plan to call in so far  but they haven t set dates as to when those witnesses will come in  with watts  testimony today  though  things could get very interesting very quickly over in the senate featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
