donald trump set off a lot of alarm bells with his claim in the last presidential debate that he would not graciously concede the election lost unless he had been convinced that the contest was not  rigged   whatever that means commentary from across the political spectrum pointed out that trump s rhetoric had more in comparison with a dictatorial strongman holding on to power than the democratically elected president of the united states and now trump s most diehard supporters are entertaining thoughts of violence if their chosen leader fails to win the race jim moseley is buying extra ammunition and stocking up on canned goods he is a donald trump supporter in south carolina  and he is preparing for  war   the civil war he thinks will start if hillary clinton is elected president  once the trucks stop rolling  the grocery shelves will go empty and gasoline rationing will go into effect   moseley  who calls himself a  christian soldier   wrote in a facebook message early this week  liberals will have targets on their backs  as their behaviors are pretty much evident   race wars will begin as well  as your skin color will be your uniform  this is bigger than just donald trump  as he is just the latest manifestation of the  paranoid style  on the right  a mindset that has pushed conspiratorial and bizarre ideas for over  years  it is the same mindset behind fox news and its creation by former nixon aide roger ailes  as well as right wing talk radio and its leading hosts like sean hannity and rush limbaugh at a certain point  if you keep telling your most devoted audience that someone is out to get them and they need guns and more to protect themselves and their families  they re going to believe it trump s decision to violate the norms of american elections are another sign that he cares more about his ego than the safety of americans featured image via flickr
