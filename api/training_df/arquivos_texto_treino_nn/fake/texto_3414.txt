quid pro quo in the trump russia situation is happening sooner than expected  at least according to russian officials   you know  they give him a gift by using hacking a propaganda to hand him the election  and trump builds a nightmarish team for himself that will be very friendly to russia  so friendly  in fact  that the kremlin is pretty openly celebrating trump s newest  gift  to them thus far  the donald has filled his cabinet to the brim with so many pro russian people that stolichnaya stocks have gone through the roof  just joking  don t bother googling that   seriously  though  russia is thrilled with trump s selections so far but it is rex tillerson s nomination for secretary of state that  as the guardian notes   confirms vladimir putin as one of the strategic victors of the us presidential election  the wall street journal notes that  friends and associates said few us citizens are closer to mr putin than mr tillerson   and  of course  tillerson will now be in a position to make a f ckton of money in his new position  as the guardian points out the  exxon rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on russia in   following the annexation of crimea and covert military intervention in eastern ukraine  exxon mobil estimated the sanctions cost it   and tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted  we always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions   he said  at a shareholders  meeting in june  two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for sechin  tillerson reportedly turned up at a st petersburg economic summit if the sanctions were lifted  the arctic project would probably go ahead and tillerson s retirement fund of exxon mobil stock would increase in value  he would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department  it might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career tillerson s nomination can be called a lot of things   but pro kremlin russian political commentator sergei markov calls it what it is   some kind of christmas gift from the american people to the russian people  especially in light of the  artificial  cold war  that was started with russia  over the country s involvement in hacking donald trump s political enemies for him  at his request  no less  fyodor lukyanov  head of the council on foreign and defense policy  which advises the kremlin  says that tillerson represents  profound changes in u s  foreign policy  that stands to favor russia heavily  mr  tillerson is very well known to the important people here  and neither mr  putin nor the others will need time to learn who he is and how to deal with him   lukyanov says   this news is better than any other possible person for this position  at this point  how can we allow donald trump to assume power on january   electors have the weight of the world on their shoulders as december  approaches  will they do nothing and allow a tyrant installed by a foreign power to take office   or will they do the right thing and say  no more  featured image via getty images alexey druzhinin
