rep  jason smith of missouri spent international women s day advocating for women   or so we re sure he thought  he s a supporter of the gop s plan for repealing the aca  which includes restricting women s access to healthcare via planned parenthood  and also severely restricts a woman s right to make choices about her own body  but the  percent tax on tanning salons  that has to go because it disproportionately harms women  and he will make sure it goes as slate reported  i wanted to see who predominantly is taxed with this tanning tax  is it men  is it women  so i went to a little google search   he said   what i found on google is roughly  percent of who s taxed are women  so out of the   million that has been created by this tax     million has come from the backs and the pockets of women  today s international women day   noted smith  who has advocated for legislation that would defund women s health clinics   it s interesting that no one is bringing that up  while yes  we could make the argument that we re unfairly taxing women with the tanning bed tax  we have to think about the fact that tanning beds also disproportionately harm women  tanning beds aren t healthy  they re a leading cause of skin cancer behind the sun  and smith wonders why we don t tax the sun oh please   they ve led to a massive increase in skin cancer in women under the age of  they re also a complete luxury  unlike things like pads and tampons  pap smears  mammograms  pre natal care  maternity care  hormonal contraception  and yes  abortion  where is he on all of this stuff  if not taxing women unfairly is so important to him  where was the impassioned plea for states to stop taxing women for pads and tampons as far as abortion  he believes in shifting from abortion to adoption  and overturning roe v  wade  which is just going to send us back to the days of back alley abortions  coat hanger abortions  and women dying because of these things  it could also lead to more women unnecessarily dying in childbirth  or being forced to carry a non viable fetus  even a dead fetus  to term  why is he not pleading for congress to make sure none of this happens by enacting legislation that s proven to lower the abortion rate and improve the odds for pregnant women and their babies this is a man who s dismissed the idea that cutting medicaid  including its funding to planned parenthood  would leave more americans without coverage  stripping medicaid funding from planned parenthood would leave low income women without access to basic women s care and birth control  which is most of what they do but no  the tanning bed tax is the worst thing we ever did to women  in his view if he wants to stand up for women s rights  he d stop with his faux  pseudo feminist pleas and actually work towards policies that have been proven to help women and their families  and lower the abortion rate  this is just shameful featured image by darin morley  cc by sa   via wikimedia
