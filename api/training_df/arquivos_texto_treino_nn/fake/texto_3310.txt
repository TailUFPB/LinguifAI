the history channel has spoken and donald trump s deplorable supporters didn t like the facts one little bit the  election was by far one of the most disappointing in american history  not to mention the most devastating to our democracy that will have far reaching consequences it is a proven fact that russia meddled with our political process by hacking into the dnc with the goal of spreading propaganda to make americans lose faith in the election process and to help trump win so putin could have a puppet in the white house well  russia succeeded and republicans apparently don t have a problem with it because their guy won  which means foreign powers can now interfere in our election the history channel marked this as a first in american history and posted about it on facebook of course  trump supporters immediately threw a temper tantrum  fake news   one supporter bellowed   no proof is provided  history channel please stick to history stories  there are plenty of them  the cia and  other intelligence agencies concluded that russia meddled in our election  that s more than enough proof  plus  trump was told about russian hacking months ago and he only urged them to keep committing espionage against our country despite the evidence  conservatives viciously attacked history channel with all sorts of wild accusations and conspiracy theories smearing democrats in defense of russia trump supporters are clearly just as thin skinned and allergic to facts as their dear leader is  but their hissy fits do not change the fact that russia did interfere with our election by committing espionage against our country  and those conservatives who claim that our intelligence community is wrong because they also said iraq had wmds are also talking out of their asses  in reality bush ignored the intelligence community when it told him that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction donald trump is an illegitimate president elect  and his supporters can t handle it in the end  history will judge the  election and the next four years under trump and both will be judged a complete disaster  many years from now  the history channel will be airing specials dedicated to examining how trump made us the laughingstock of the world and how putin used trump to prevent the united states from challenging russian aggression  that s assuming the united states still exists in four years featured image  andrew renneisen getty images
