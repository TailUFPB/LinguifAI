the white house is beginning to panic  at least that s the most logical conclusion from their latest jaw dropping move  in an order that s pretty much unprecedented  wouldn t it be nice if we had just one day without something unprecedented coming from this white house    the trump white house has told various government departments that they are not to cooperate with democrats period reportedly  this has been happening since trump took office  they have formulated a policy that says that agencies are only allowed to respond to committee chairs  republicans hold both houses of congress  so every committee is chaired by a republican the declaration amounts to a new level of partisanship in washington  where the president and his administration already feels besieged by media reports and attacks from democrats  the idea  republicans said  is to choke off the democratic congressional minorities from gaining new information that could be used to attack the president  you have republicans leading the house  the senate and the white house   a white house official said   i don t think you d have the democrats responding to every minority member request if they were in the same position  a white house spokeswoman said the policy of the administration is  to accommodate the requests of chairmen  regardless of their political party   there are no democratic chairmen  as congress is controlled by republicans source  politicothe information blackout  at least according to white house officials  isn t toward every request from democrats  just the requests from oversight committees  whew  that should make us all feel so much better  it s only the agencies that are tagged with making sure laws are followed that are being hobbled while obama s white house didn t answer every request from republicans  admittedly  many are meant to back the opposition into a corner   there was never an explicit policy now  of course  while the agencies are under the executive umbrella  they work for the office of the presidency  not for the president personally  for trump  though  that seems to be far too nuanced a distinction  while agencies are legally free  and some would argue ethically obligated  to abide by oversight requests  even from the minority party  trump has proven that he will fire anyone who steps out of line this could certainly backfire  though  if trump is still in office by the time midterms roll around  and if he keeps destroying the republican party  we could see a democratic takeover of at least one house of congress  that would give democrats committee chairs  while the white house could still ignore democrats  requests  there would be no way around the word  obstruction  featured image via pool getty images
