if there s one person that donald trump can t stand to have criticizing him  it s his predecessor  barack obama   and obama just attacked trump in a way that was pretty damn genius last night  at a private event in manhattan  the former potus reminded america of the amazing leader they lost when his second term was up  as trump continuously blasts him and takes credit for the many accomplishments that he worked hard for  obama reminded the audience just how resilient and successful obamacare is   by pointing out that obamacare now has a higher approval rating than the current president according to cnn  as republicans in washington sputtered again this week in their efforts to undo the law  obama noted to an audience in midtown manhattan that  the affordable care act has never been more popular   and it s more popular than the current president   according to a person in the room who paraphrased the comments  we couldn t have thought of a better way to insult trump and the republican party  especially as their efforts to repeal and replace the affordable care act continue to be a disastrous  embarrassing failure obamacare  which trump repeatedly referred to as a  disaster  and  jobs killer   isn t going anywhere thanks to its popularity and the gop s failure to do any better  considering that trump s approval ratings are at a historic low despite its honeymoon period  it s unlikely that any major piece of legislation that he tries to pass will be accepted it s nice to see that after all the backlash and attacks from trump and the republican party  obama is reveling in his hard work  the knowledge that his health care bill could not be taken down so easily and is now more appreciated by americans than the idiot who replaced him in the white house  must be satisfying as hell and obama has earned the right to gloat about it featured image via zach gibson   getty images
