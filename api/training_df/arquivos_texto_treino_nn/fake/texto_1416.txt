earlier this year  jason chaffetz  the house oversight chairman who carried around a two year obsession when it came to investigating hillary clinton  suddenly shocked washington when he announced that he will not run for another term in congress in   now that the probe into trump s ties to russia is getting too hot for a lot of republicans to handle  it is being reported that chaffetz won t even finish his term  in fact  according to politico  he could be gone by june  now  this development comes just one day after former fbi director robert mueller has been named as a special counsel into the russia probe  this is most curious  seeing how just last year  chaffetz showed the world just how much he likes investigating people  in fact  he once said he had years of investigations lined up for hillary  had she won the presidency  however  now that it s his guy in the oval office  chaffetz suddenly has no interest in sticking around to see this thing through to the end could it be that chaffetz knows that trump s days are numbered  and he doesn t want to be around with the rest of the republicans who are ending their careers by keeping their wagons firmly hitched to the disaster that is donald trump  or  could it be that chaffetz himself knows more than he is letting on  after all  it just leaked that house majority leader kevin mccarthy and house speaker paul ryan knew that trump was being paid by the russians and tried to cover it up this scandal could be coursing through the entire republican party  and by the time we get to the bottom of it all  they might all find themselves on the wrong side of the law and going down in flames good going  gop  you see what you ve done to your party and to the nation by backing the treasonous trump  if the rest of you had any sense  you d be resigning before the shit hits the fan just like jason chaffetz featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
