we all know that donald trump s skin is very thin  he is also a narcissist the likes of which the world has never seen on the word leadership stage  therefore  the thought of losing the  presidential election has likely not really occurred to him in any real sense  however  his disastrous debate performance  combined with a huge tilt away from his favor in the polls following a week of chaos that was completely his own doing means that a loss in november is looking more and more likely  the donald just cannot take that  though  so he has a new solution in the event of his losing the electon  he just won t accept the result at the debate  in which trump seemed to run out of gas and eventually melt down completely  he still nonetheless said he would accept the results should he lose to democratic nominee hillary clinton  however  now that it seems that a loss might be something that is looming  trump is going back on his loss  according to the new york times  trump s assessment is thus mr  trump  aiming to unnerve mrs  clinton  even indicated that he was rethinking his statement at their last debate that he would  absolutely  support her if she won in november  saying   we re going to have to see  we re going to see what happens  we re going to have to see  so  in other words  trump is sending a dog whistle fog horn to his most ardent  hateful  aggressive  and uneducated supporters that says just what they already believe  if he doesn t win  it was rigged  this is beyond dangerous  considering that we can never plant the seeds of doubt in the integrity of our electoral system and process  while we all know that things like voter id laws and false accusations of voter intimidation most definitely are aimed at disenfranchising minority voters because they largely tend to vote left  there is absolutely nothing to suggest that anything more nefarious is going on regarding election rigging trump s inability to accept that no one   not even him   wins all the time is downright dangerous  it cannot be stressed enough that we must trust the result of this election  and every election  no matter how unsatisfied we might be with the outcome  that means that if folks like me wake up on november  to headlines of president trump  i must accept it  and if i cannot tolerate it  i must move to another country trump s supporters must do the same  they have shown themselves to be violent  paranoid  hateful  and ignorant  though  so it will be no surprise if they refuse to accept any outcome of the  presidential election beyond the one they desire  this is simply further proof that donald trump s candidacy is dangerous  i shudder to think what will happen if he is actually elected president featured image via mark wilson getty images
