here s another hole in the leaky ship that is the argument trump shouldn t be taken  literally  when he makes threats  trump has circled back to his campaign promise to make changes to libel laws that would allow him to go after journalists and news organizations which publish things he doesn t like  he held out for less than three months trump s rediscovered love of censorship comes on the heels of several straight days of trump freaking out about the new york times reporting on his various scandals  and it s probably no coincidence that trump is reconsidering press freedom right as his approval rating hits historic lows  the worst since nixon was impeached and a record low for any president at this stage in office  in a culmination of trump s rant against the new york times  he called for a change in libel laws and used an article written by the new york post   a right leaning daily owned by rupert murdoch   to pretend his troubles are due to the  liberal media  and not his own incompetence the failing  nytimes has disgraced the media world  gotten me wrong for two solid years  change libel laws  https   t co qiqlgvylli  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    article shows how thoroughly unserious it is just three sentences in when it repeats the lie that the new york times  apologized  to readers for being so biased against trump  the paper did no such thing  the only other person who routinely suggests that it did is none other than trump himself  the relationship between the new york post and donald trump is an orange painted echo chamber trump s belief that he can pass libel laws to restrict what the press says about him is terrifying  but not original  he made similar remarks during the campaign  here s trump channeling a dictator in february   one of the things i m going to do if i win  and i hope we do and we re certainly leading  i m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles  we can sue them and win lots of money  we re going to open up those libel laws  so when the new york times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace or when the washington post  which is there for other reasons  writes a hit piece  we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they re totally protected  as the old adage goes  he told us who he was  we should have believed him featured image via mark wilson getty images
