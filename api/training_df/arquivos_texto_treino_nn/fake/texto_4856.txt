andrea tantaros is ramping up the pressure on her former employers and colleagues to answer for their behavior and face the consequences earlier this month  the former fox host declared war on the conservative network by slapping them with a sexual harassment lawsuit which names bill o reilly among other such as roger ailes and bill shine according to the lawsuit  fox news masquerades as a defender of traditional family values  but behind the scenes  it operates like a sex fueled  playboy mansion like cult  steeped in intimidation  indecency and misogyny  indeed  tantaros says she was never allowed to wear pants on set and that ailes seriously creeped her out on multiple occasions by obsessing with her legs and asking her to spin around for him so he could ogle her  when refused to comply with his outrageous demand he retaliated by firing her from the five and placed her on a lower rated show top executives attempted to pay tantaros off if she would drop her allegations but she turned the offer down fox news has denied the allegations  of course  but that isn t stopping tantaros from charging ahead buzzfeed reports that tantaros is upping the ante by daring fox news personnel to take a lie detector test and offered to take one in return so that it can be determined who is telling the truth and who is lying it s a brilliant move on tantaros  part  if fox declines it can be assumed that they have something to hide  like guilt  it would also vindicate tantaros and give further credence to her allegations tantaros even released the questions she wants certain fox news personnel to answer for instance  a series of questions for roger ailes will seek to determine if he did  in fact  say inappropriate things to tantaros in the workplace or if he ever retaliated against her for refusing his advances here s an image of the questions via buzzfeed editor kyle blaine a series of question posed to ailes  replacement bill shine includes whether or not he knew about tantaros  complaints about ailes and whether or not someone within the company arranged for negative comments to be spread about her on social media questions for fox news executive vice president dianne brandi inquire if she had knowledge of tantaros  complaints about the hostile working environment and if fox has paid money to more than six women to settle sexual harassment suits and finally  questions for irena briganti and bill o reilly include whether briganti helped ailes retaliate against tantaros and whether o reilly hit on her and made inappropriate comments about her tantaros  lawyers go on to state that  an innocent person would jump at the chance for this kind of vindication  and added that their client would  not risk offering this proposal  if she  were not telling the truth  to put it bluntly  andrea tantaros is taking her feud with fox news to whole new level and these questions are damning all on their own without fox answering any of them for years  fox news treated women like powerless sex objects  now they are finding out just how powerful women can be  especially when they are pissed off about being treated like shit featured image via screenshot
