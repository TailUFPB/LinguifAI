it s two days before americans head to the polls to choose between an orange  unhinged self described billionaire and one of the most sane candidates we ve ever had for the presidency  tensions are high  especially within the campaigns  trump s campaign is so worried their nominee will tweet something that could lose him the election  they ve blocked him from using the social networking site  when president obama heard about it  he had no choice but to mock trump  apparently his campaign has taken away his twitter   obama said during a florida rally for hillary clinton  to laughs  in the last two days  they had so little confidence in his self control  they said   we re just going to take away your twitter   now  if somebody can t handle a twitter account  they can t handle the nuclear code   obama continued  if somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning because snl made fun of you  then you can t handle the nuclear codes  source  the hillhere s the video president obama is right  the very fact that trump can t even be trusted with his twitter account means that he d be a very dangerous president  he seems incapable of letting even the tiniest slight go  in one now infamous twitter rant  trump relentlessly attacked former miss universe alicia machado  all during a time he was fielding accusations of sexism the new york times summed trump s impulse control issues  which are demonstrated on twitter  pretty well the tirade fit a pattern  it is when mr  trump is alone with his thoughts  and untethered from his campaign staff  that he has seemed to commit his most self destructive acts  there has always been this dangerous part of him that will go too far and do something that backfires   said michael d antonio  the author of  the truth about trump   a new biography of the real estate mogul  his worst impulses   he added   are self defeating  unfortunately  it s not just the nuclear codes we should be afraid of  trump is running for the office of one of the premier diplomats in the world  his temperament is completely unfit for that position  or really  for any position that requires dealing with people featured image via brian blanco getty images
