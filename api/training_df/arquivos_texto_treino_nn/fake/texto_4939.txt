the women of fox news are sick and tired of putting up with the sexist bullshit of their male colleagues and bosses after gretchen carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against roger ailes it became clear that sexism and misogyny ran deeper within the company than anyone realized  as it turns out  it went way beyond on air comments made by male anchors like bill o reilly once megyn kelly backed carlson up  ailes was up a creek without a paddle and was soon ousted from his position  the scandal rocked the conservative network as former female reporters came forward to tell their own stories of non stop harassment that turned the workplace into a personal hell and now carlson is not the only one filing a lawsuit  andrea tantaros has as well tantaros filed a lawsuit in new york state supreme court on monday hammering the network for punishing her when she went to the top brass to complain about ailes sexually harassing her  fox news masquerades as a defender of traditional family values  but behind the scenes  it operates like a sex fueled  playboy mansion like cult  steeped in intimidation  indecency and misogyny   her lawsuit says according to the new york times  as it turns out  tantaros also named bill o reilly in the lawsuit for making unwanted advances toward her fox executives attempted to pay tantaros off if she renounced her claims but she told them to go f ck themselves the lawsuit details how roger ailes treated her  including being barred from wearing pants on set because ailes wanted to see her legs and he often asked her to turn around in his office so her could ogle her  she refused and was punished as a result by being yanked off  the five  and placed on  outnumbered   which is a lower rated show tantaros attempted to seek help within the company from bill shine  who was recently named co president of the network after ailes departed but he told her to  let this one go  because ailes is too powerful  ailes did not act alone   the lawsuit continues   he may have been the primary culprit  but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants  who engaged in a concerted effort to silence tantaros by threats  humiliation and retaliation  in short  bill o reilly and bill shine have been named alongside ailes  and even steve doocy was named in carlson s lawsuit  these are some huge names at fox news  which means the network that preached family values while spitting on women for years in front of the camera are now getting outed for being pricks toward their own female colleagues behind the camera as well one has to wonder how many more women will come forward and how long fox news can survive if more of their big stars fall in utter disgrace while i disagree with tantaros politically  no woman should have to deal with discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace  but it sounds like the men of fox news treated their workplace like a frat house and treated women like objects meant to be demeaned and disrespected fox news is starting to fall apart like a house of cards  but let s be honest  it was only a matter of time featured image via dangerous minds
