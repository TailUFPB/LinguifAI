there s a reason trump hates cnn  and it s been obvious for a long time  however  what many may not know is exactly why cnn s negative coverage gets under his skin so badly  it turns out that he believes cnn owes him for putting their current president  jeff zucker  in place  when the network released the  access hollywood  tapes in which trump admitted to sexually assaulting women  and then followed that up with increasingly bad coverage  he saw it as an act of betrayal so he sent zucker this letter  jeff   too bad you  cnn  couldn t be honest with how well i did in the debate  the dumbest thing i ever did was get you the job at cnn   you are the most disloyal person  just remember  i always seem to find a way to get even  best wishes  donald j  trump  yep   you are the most disloyal person   trump literally believes that zucker should reward him with favorable coverage throughout what the rest of his career  or his whole career in politics  or something  maybe he expected cnn to just ignore all the heinous things he does because he was so awesome to them way back the hilarious thing is what s happened since  from the new york times he only thing better than having donald trump on your network is having him attack it  far from hurting cnn  trump s war against it has amounted to a form of product placement    earned media   you could say   giving its anchors and correspondents starring roles in the ongoing political drama  turning them into camera ready warriors for the first amendment in   cnn made nearly   billion  which was the network s most profitable year ever  they re on track to beat that for  already  and it s only april  zucker s on a hiring spree  they re getting some huge scoops  the list of good fortune goes on so revenge  it s backfired on trump horrifically cnn disagrees that trump s  lobbying had any effect on their decision to give zucker the top position  and it wouldn t be surprising to find that they re actually telling the truth  trump is a narcissist who believes he has far more influence over everyone than he does featured image by shawn thew pool via getty images
