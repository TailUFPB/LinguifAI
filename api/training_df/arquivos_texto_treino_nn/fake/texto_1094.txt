it s an old story  a demographic won t vote republican  so republicans find ways to prevent said demographic from voting instead of figuring out what they can do to get that group to vote for them  an arizona republican is once again engaging in this nonsense by claiming that college students unfairly influence elections because they register to vote where they go to school  and not where their permanent addresses are bob thorpe s claim is that the votes of college students  dilute the votes of full time residents  in local elections  thorpe represents flagstaff  which is home to northern arizona university  republicans had a difficult time holding their seats in that particular district  what thorpe wants to do is prohibit students from using their dorms or other college addresses from registering to vote thorpe tried to spin his voter suppression tactic into something positive with this absolutely transparent lie  address several problems with voting in arizona s college communities while ensuring that voting rights are preserved for all arizona voters  preserving voter rights for all arizonans  ha there s a problem beyond the obvious one of voter suppression  thorpe makes no mention of other part time residents who flee colder states to reside in arizona for six months out of the year  one bloc of part time residents is okay  another is not  while snowbirds might maintain two permanent addresses one in one state and one in arizona thorpe doesn t seem to have a problem with them  diluting votes  of permanent residents  snowbirds   as they re called  tend to vote republican  and they tend to vote against things like budget overrides for the educational system  since they don t want to pay for an education system that doesn t include their children college students  on the other hand  tend to vote democratic and education budget questions  along with everything else educational  affect them directly  both tucson and tempe home to the university of arizona and arizona state university respectively are heavily democratic  flagstaff leans red but could go either way so thorpe  like other republicans who would rather cheat that change their policy positions  decided that the problem is the college students not voting where they ought to be  he wants to make it so they have to register with their permanent addresses  and then get their ballots mailed to their college addresses that kind of thing could discourage them from voting  in addition to preventing them from voting for people and things that directly affect them while they re in school  it s time for republicans to figure out why they aren t reaching certain demographics and stop trying to force those demographics out of the electorate featured image via mark wilson getty images
