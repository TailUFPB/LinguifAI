on sunday  fox news had a rare moment of clarity and actually decided to share the truth with their viewers  breaking the hearts of donald trump voters around the world as trump continues to brag and tweet about polls that are biased and inaccurate  while ignoring actual facts   fox news blasted the failing potus  disastrous health care plan and noted that americans overwhelmingly prefer obamacare the poll was taken just a few days ago and states that   of americans approve obamacare  and only   are willing to support a republican replacement  some weren t fond of either      but the evidence was clear   the people in this country do not want the gop to repeal the affordable care act and replace it with one of their death sentences this poll comes just days after trump trashed the republican party on twitter  calling out their  failed  health care plan and urging them to make a decision as soon as possible  trump and the gop are more desperate than ever for a legislative win  and this poll proves that it s only going to be another humiliating loss for them  every time the congressional budget office analyzes one of the republicans  proposals  each version looks worse than the last americans are already well aware that many of them  millions  actually  will lose their health care coverage under trumpcare  for many  the gop s replacement plan will be life threatening  even a good portion of trump s most loyal supporters are terrified of losing their obamacare  and have publicly spoken out in favor of keeping the health care bill because they ve benefited so greatly from it one thing is for sure   when trump sees what his favorite news channel has just tweeted  he s going to have a colossal meltdown  he relies on fox news to hide his failures  and this truth bomb isn t going to sit well featured image via jeff j mitchell    getty images
