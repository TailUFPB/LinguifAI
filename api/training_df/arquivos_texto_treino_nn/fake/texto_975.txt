we all know that donald trump is a misogynistic sexual predator  that s the kind of public life he has led  and it is the kind of so called  presidential  campaign he ran  however  now that he is sitting in the oval office and representing america as our head of state  his words matter  therefore  his disgusting  sexist attacks on morning joe co host mika brzezinski are all the more gravely disturbing  thankfully  people are calling him out  however  that isn t enough  the entire gop needs to rebuke trump for what he is doing on twitter  and one democratic congresswoman is pointing that out  rep  barbara lee of california taking to trump s favorite medium of communication  twitter  rep  lee called on her gop colleagues to stop excusing trump s behavior and standing by him  for his words are having a terribly negative impact on the impressionable children of america  rep  lee tweeted i want my gop colleagues to explain to my  granddaughters why they think these viciously sexist comments are acceptable from our president  https   t co   rep  barbara lee   repbarbaralee  june    went on to remind everyone that this isn t about trump anymore  it is also about the republican party s crazy tolerance and even acceptance of open and overt misogyny this isn t just about trump  we already knew he has no respect for women  it s also about the gop   which continues to defend   support him   rep  barbara lee   repbarbaralee  june    again  the gop has long been an anti woman party  it is there in their policies  in their refusal to vote for the protection of domestic violence victims or in favor of equal pay for women  and their constant and unending stream of assaults on women s reproductive healthcare  in a way  that makes trump the perfect standard bearer for their party besides all of that  the party is largely made up of old  craven  white men  who couldn t care less about the well being of women  the radio silence from the gop side is in no way surprising  considering all of this featured image via win mcnamee getty images
