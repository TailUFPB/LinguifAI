last night  trump international hotel in washington  dc played host to a temporary art installation  the words  pay trump bribes here  and  emoluments welcome  were projected on the front entrance of the building  the project instantly captured the attention of twitter and went viral even as it was happening  this morning  we learned that the projection was another project of dc based artist robin bell  bell  who works as a video journalist and multimedia artist for his own bell visuals  has put together projects like this before  in november of last year  bell put together a similar campaign to oppose the climate change denier that trump put in charge of his epa transition team  he has also put together other projects in support of cannabis legalization and in support of women s reproductive rights in an interview with the los angeles time  bell said that he s not worried about getting in trouble for his art installations  these fringe alt right groups have gone from a minority of hateful assholes to having the ear of the president  which is terrifying   bell says   the work that we do is a resistance to that  he said   when we first started doing it  we were concerned and we reached out for legal advice  but from the research we did  it was legal  the one thing we can t do is block traffic  we can t create an impediment on the sidewalk  according to bell  his largest goal is to get people talking about the issues  but he also sees his art as a way to fight against an authoritarian government   i was reading this thing about when you deal with authoritarian governments  you have to create your own story   he says   if we re reacting to these people all the time  they can just play us  so  part of the thing is making things that you can laugh at  that you can share  that aren t just reacting to them  photography and video copyright liz gorman and robin bell
