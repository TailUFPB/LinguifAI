if you didn t know  friday was holocaust remembrance day   a day in which we remember the victims of a man who was very much like our current president   surprisingly  someone on donald trump s staff took time away from celebrating the  other side  of that battle and put out a halfhearted  generic  and disrespectful statement on his behalf   one which trump then made his own by tweeting it the american people statement on international holocaust remembrance day  https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    s statement is three paragraphs long and reads like it was written by the same guy who has been writing his executive orders   white supremacist steve bannon  trump says he wants to honor the  victims  survivors  heroes of the holocaust    though many of his neo nazi supporters would surely disagree with others on the identities of the  heroes  of the holocaust  notably  trump didn t specifically mention jewish people a single time   a clear fan service for the klansmen and sieg heilers who rally behind him trump concludes with a pledge to do  everything  in his power to  ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good   for instance  if a thin skinned egomaniac backed by an army of neo nazis  christofascists  and other assorted terrible people teamed up with a foreign dictator to manipulate the election and place himself in the oval office so he can build a walkl to keep brown people out of the country  ban people of a specific religion from entering  and generally abuse the powers of the office to make the bigoted dreams of his deplorable supporters come to life trump would totally put a stop to that  together  we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world   said the man who is   holocaust remembrance day   signing an executive order banning refugees from countries he thinks have too many muslims if this all seems crazy and hypocritical to you  you re not the only one  seemingly all of twitter showed up

race since he assumed office a week ago  in that time he has signed executive orders banning a large number of muslims from entering the country based solely on where they live and effectively signing the death warrants of countless would be refugees  stripped federal funding from any international health organization that so much as mentions abortion  ordered the construction of a wall along our southern border and authorized the construction of concentration camps for undocumented immigrants  during his campaign  he retweeted neo nazis and their propaganda almost constantly he should probably just not talk about the holocaust featured image via getty images  pool  screengrab
