until november   democrats desperately tried to dismiss the prediction of presidential historian allan lichtman  who has accurately predicted every presidential election for the last  years  unfortunately  it turned out polls were wrong and he was completely right lichtman has a second part to his prediction  though  while he accurately called the fact that trump would win the white house  he s now predicting that he will just as quickly lose it through impeachment while his electoral prediction was based on a scientific system  his latest prediction is not  it s a gut call  but let s call his an educated gut  his main argument is the baggage that trump is carrying with him to the oval office  but it has a few reasons behind it  what you see  is what you get  candidates don t fundamentally change  donald trump throughout his life has played fast and loose with the law  he was found by the justice department in the seventies to have discriminated against african americans with his real estate business  this video is a couple of days old  so lichtman didn t know that trump would be settling the trump university fraud case that s been hanging over his head  but that s far from the only scandal  while that alleged victim in the child rape case dropped the charges  gloria allred  the alleged victim s attorney  said the story isn t over yet all of this  though  might just be an excuse to get rid of trump  trump is a wildcard and if there s anything republicans can t stand  it s unpredictable behavior  republicans love control and they would love to see mike pence  the vice president  as president because he is predictable and controllable  pence is anti choice and anti gay  trump keeps changing his opinions on those issues  that type of moral uncertainty doesn t sit well with the  ber religious republican party here s the video of course  if trump is impeached  that would leave us with a president pence  trust me when i say that s no better featured image via mark wilson getty images
