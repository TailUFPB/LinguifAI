anthony scaramucci got his ass handed to him on sunday morning by cnn host jake tapper just a day has gone by since scaramucci became the white house communications director  resulting in the resignation of sean spicer as press secretary a mere six months into trump s presidency  and he is already insisting that the russians did not interfere with the  election just because trump said so that s despite our nation s intelligence agencies and former and current intelligence officials confirming otherwise during a discussion about whether trump will sign the bipartisan legislation that slaps sanctions on russia  scaramucci used an anonymous source to claim that the american people have been misinformed about russia  there s a lot of disinformation   scaramucci said   somebody said to me the other day   i don t want to say who   if the russians actually hacked this situation and spilled out those emails  you would have never seen it  you would have never had any evidence of them  meaning that they re super confident in their deception skills and hacking  but our intelligence agencies have confirmed that russian did  in fact  meddle in our election by attacking our democratic institutions by hacking  which can be traced back to the perpetrators by our own professional cyber security experts  basically  scaramucci is claiming that the russians are too good to get caught by us  that s simply not true and tapper was quick to call scaramucci out for it  but not before he slammed scaramucci for citing an anonymous source  wait  wait  wait   tapper chimed in   i don t know who this anonymous person is  and then scaramucci demonstrated that  just like trump  he can t keep his mouth shut and is a leaker  how about it s the president  jake   scaramucci replied   he called me from air force one and basically said to me   this is   maybe they did it  maybe they didn t do it  wow  that s truly pathetic tapper proceeded to tear scaramucci apart for being trump s yes man instead of accepting the analysis of our own intelligence agencies and trump s own director of national intelligence  this is exactly the issue   tapper said   we have experts  the u s  intelligence agencies  unanimous  both obama appointees and trump appointees   the director of national intelligence  the head of the national security agency  the head of the fbi  i mean  all of these intelligence experts  saying  russia hacked the election  they tried to interfere in the election  president trump is contradicting it and you re siding with president trump  indeed  it certainly appears scaramucci is just shilling for trump and he even proceeded to whine about tapper s observation  leading tapper to ask   don t you owe a duty to the truth  scaramucci then claimed that he doesn t know what the truth is because   i don t have the information in front of me  but he didn t even bother to get the information  instead  he got talking points from trump and merely parroted them on television like a good little lapdog here s the video via youtube scaramucci is already making it clear that he is untrustworthy  he just threw our intelligence community under the bus and demonstrated that he is the kind of leaker that trump whines about  he couldn t even stop himself from bragging about how trump himself was the anonymous source who told him russia didn t hack us  the evidence clearly shows that russia attacked us and our democratic institutions  only self serving fools would believe otherwise  featured image  screenshot
