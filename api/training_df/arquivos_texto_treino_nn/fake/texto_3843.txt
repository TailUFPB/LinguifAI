donald trump is the best player on the terrorist organization s team  and they couldn t be happier that he won the election tuesday s election results have not only emboldened racists to attack minorities across the country  it has emboldened isis trump s victory drew celebration from isis fighters on social media  and the comments should make americans regret their decision to put such an inexperienced person in the white house  rejoice  he will show america s ugly face   said fighter wrote and trump has already done that by using the divisive and hateful rhetoric that is splitting the country along political and racial lines that will take years to heal  trump can beg for unity all he wants  he squandered that opportunity from the very first day of his campaign  i am optimistic about trump s victory because he is a stupid  arrogant  hubristic bull who is dumber than bush   another isis fighter said and it s true  donald trump doesn t have a clue how to govern and he certainly doesn t know how to lead a military force  after all  he dodged the draft multiple times during vietnam and ridiculously claimed that he  knows more about isis than the generals do   all while expressing wonder at why the united states doesn t just use nuclear weapons to defeat enemies most of all  isis fighters are cheering trump s victory because he is inspiring others to join them  trump s vulgarity will embarrass  arab  tyrants and enlarge the field of jihad   one fighter wrote   if trump wins  it s in our favor   another said but they are only too happy to let donald trump rip the united states apart for them  praise god  may he increase this   one fighter said of the divisions and hate trump has caused  if we can inflame the dissension and troubles in their countries maybe they ll withdraw   wrote another  signaling that isis may try to stoke fear and violence among americans and they are hoping that trump is the beginning of the end of the united states as a world power and beacon of democracy  trump s rule may be the beginning of a split in the united states and the era of its disintegration  considering trump did significant damage to our democratic values and system  and the fact that russia probably believes they have a puppet in the white house who will help them weaken nato  it s pretty clear that donald trump is already harming this country domestically and around the world america is a joke now because of donald trump s victory  he is a vengeful man who ignores facts and is easily provoked  isis wants nothing more than for the united states to sacrifice more blood and treasure in the middle east and he may very well give them want they want because he wants to prove how tough he is  our enemies sense weakness and they are moving to exploit that weakness for their own gain  conservatives may think they found their champion  but our enemies know they found their fool featured image  brian blanco getty images
