senator bob corker  r tn  has had enough of the chaos in donald trump s white house  he is so fed up  in fact  that he is choosing to retire rather than run for another term  therefore  there is no political cost to pay for criticizing trump  and boy is he taking advantage  first  senator corker called trump unstable after the disastrous response to the white supremacist violence in charlottesville  then  he said that secretary of state rex tillerson  secretary of defense general james mattis  and white house chief of staff general john kelly are the only people standing between the united states of america and complete chaos  now  corker is going all in on trump s childish twitter habits  on sunday morning  in response to more twitter vomit from trump  corker tweeted it s a shame the white house has become an adult day care center  someone obviously missed their shift this morning   senator bob corker   senbobcorker  october     corker is clearly completely unleashed here and out of f cks to give when it comes to trump s unseemly and disgraceful behavior from the highest office in the land  this is important though  for another reason  the fact that likely his comrades in the republican party on capitol hill are feeling the same way  and simply can t say it for fear of alienating trump s base and losing their congressional majority  however  since corker is leaving  he clearly doesn t care about any of that  this opens a door  though   the one that allows gop lawmakers to say what they really think of trump  if the guy who was second in line to become secretary of state is saying this about trump  what is everyone else saying behind closed doors  now that corker has opened the door for them to go public  all they need to do is walk through it featured image via mark wilson getty images
