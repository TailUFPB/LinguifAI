have you ever wondered where a phrase started  how about the phrase  prime the pump   it is widely considered to mean the use of government money to get a project going  while it dates back to the   president donald trump is now claiming that he invented the phrase  in reality  the use of the phrase  prime the pump  predates trump s own birth by a hundred years  and the use of it in the current economic sense has existed since the  in a recent conversation with the economist  this exchange happened  they were talking about trump s tax plan  the economist  but beyond that it s ok if the tax plan increases the deficit  trump  it is ok  because it won t increase it for long  you may have two years where you ll you understand the expression  prime the pump   the economist  yes  trump  we have to prime the pump  the economist  it s very keynesian  trump  we re the highest taxed nation in the world  have you heard that expression before  for this particular type of an event  the economist  priming the pump  trump  yeah  have you heard it  the economist  yes  trump  have you heard that expression used before  because i haven t heard it  i mean  i just i came up with it a couple of days ago and i thought it was good  it s what you have to do according to the free dictionary prime the pump  encourage the growth or action of something  as in  marjorie tried to prime the pump by offering some new issues for discussion   in the late  this expression originally was used for pouring liquid into a pump to expel the air and make it work  in the  it was applied to government efforts to stimulate the economy and thereafter was applied to other undertakings it is hardly surprising that a  trump had never heard this phrase  as it is rarely used on twitter and b  he would take credit for it  in a week with so many gaffes  lies and just strange behavior  this may not be as big an issue but it s clear how little this man knows and how little he understands the world and reality that the rest of us live in  another explanation could be that trump is much  much older than we have been led to believe and has gone completely senile featured image via photo by joe raedle getty images
