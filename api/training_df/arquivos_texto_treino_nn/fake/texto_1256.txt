donald trump may want to hire the best and the brightest to represent him in his growing russia scandal  but that s certainly not what he is going to get  apparently  had as big a problem in finding competent legal representation as he is in filling the government with worthwhile people yahoo news reports that the white house sought help from brendan sullivan of williams   connolly  ted olson of gibson  dunn   crutcher  paul clement and mark filip of kirkland   ellis  and robert giuffra of sullivan   cromwell  in dealing with the russia investigation all of them told him to f ck the f ck off while he ultimately settled   key word being  settled    on his chief lawyer  marc e  kasowitz  he was turned down by some of the biggest names in the legal profession because trump wouldn t listen to their advice  and even if he did listen he would continue his long tradition of not paying people he hires the lawyers and their firms cited a variety of factors in choosing not to take on the president as a client  some  like brendan sullivan  said they had upcoming trials or existing commitments that would make it impossible for them to devote the necessary time and resources to trump s defense others mentioned potential conflicts with clients of their firms  such as financial institutions that have already received subpoenas relating to potential money laundering issues that are part of the investigation but a consistent theme  the sources said  was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position  the concerns were   the guy won t pay and he won t listen   said one lawyer close to the white house who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration  as well as deliberations within the firms themselves in addition  there are fears that association with the donald would  kill recruitment  because of the shame involved in serving trump willingly  do i want to be associated with this president and his policies   the lawyer said trump has representation  but it really says something that the top legal minds in the nation consider him and the russia scandal a lost cause featured image via getty images win mcnamee
