conservative  christian  leaders who still support donald trump despite his sexism and remarks about sexual assault are feeling the wrath of christian women right now when donald trump was caught bragging about groping women  hitting on teen girls  and accused of sexual assault  conservative  christians  like tony perkins  ralph reed  and pat robertson all said that they continue to support the republican nominee  thus proving that they care more about power than they do about morals indeed  the hypocrisy of conservative  christian  leaders  when it comes to trump  has been stunning to watch unfold because these men are literally giving trump a pass  if trump had sexually assaulted men instead of women  you can be sure perkins and the rest of his ilk would not only be calling for trump to be removed from the ballot  they d be calling for his execution but because trump assaulted and insulted women  these so called  men of god  don t give a damn and they pissed women off in the process  which is why  christian women from across the country signed a letter to these male leaders calling them out for continuing to support trump  as christian women we are appalled by republican presidential nominee donald trump s recorded remarks that disparage women and condone sexual assault   the women wrote   such language cannot be dismissed as  locker room talk  mr  trump must offer public contrition that fully acknowledges the seriousness and depravity of his actions the sin of misogyny has caused many of us to experience sexual assault or sexually abusive language that threatened our safety  dignity and well being christian leaders cannot condone such violent speech about women as a minor mistake or an innocent attempt to be  macho   these excuses teach our young people that such language is acceptable and do further harm to those who have been abused we urge all religious leaders to preach  teach and help their communities heal from the twin sins of sexual violence and misogyny  while we are disheartened by mr  trump s toxic words  we believe this moment presents an opportunity to teach our daughters and sons that they are loved  and to teach all americans how to speak out against sexually violent language unlike the charlatans who still support trump and dare to call themselves  christians   these  women are demonstrating true christian values donald trump s words and behavior is unacceptable and should be condemned by religious leaders  not ignored or excused  ignoring and excusing his behavior and words only sends a message to men within and outside of the congregation that it is okay to treat women like shit  but it s not okay and donald trump should not be allowed to be president of the united states any conservative  christian  who still supports trump after these latest revelations even after whining for years about how america supposedly needs a president with strong moral values in the white house  should be ashamed of themselves because they not only revealed themselves as hypocrites  they disgraced their church and their god featured image  dashboard jesus via amazon
