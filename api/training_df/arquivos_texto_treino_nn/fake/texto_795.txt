jared kushner  donald trump s son in law  has already lawyered up  but maybe he should get more lawyers because he might be in a bit of trouble right now  it s not just jared  but a senior white house adviser  too  you see  most of us don t simply forget about millions of dollars  or thousands  or hundreds  in fact  for a guy who owes a fuckton of money  we re pretty sure he didn t  forget  about it either on friday  jared and a senior white house adviser released a revised version of his personal financial disclosure which now shows that his initial filing omitted dozens of assets  including commercial real estate  bonds issued by the new york water and sewer authority  a personal art collection and a new jersey liquor license  the wall street journal reports hey  we re not talking about one or two assets that jared omitted from his earlier form  we re talking about  of them ivanka trump s form hasn t yet been certified by the ethics office  as required by law  details schmetails  jared and ivanka have followed each of the required steps in their transition from private citizens to federal officials   jamie gorelick  a lawyer for the couple  said in a statement drain the swamp  donald trump said  then he filled it up with his swampy family members the new disclosure shows mr  kushner and ms  trump collectively hold between   million and   million in assets  mr  kushner s initial disclosure put the value of their assets between   million and   million  the changes in values may reflect divestments since the last filing and the broad range of valuation for assets well now  that s not a lot of money  oh wait  don fox  who served as the ethics office s general counsel from  to  and as acting director from  until   says otherwise fox said the number of omissions on jared kushner s initial form was unusually high   that strikes me as a lot   he said you don t say the wall street journal reports in his initial disclosure  mr  kushner didn t identify business relationships with goldman sachs group and billionaires george soros and peter thiel through a real estate tech startup called cadre that mr  kushner co founded and currently partly owns  the wall street journal reported earlier this year  an investment in cadre valued at between   million and   million was included on the new disclosure  which showed mr  kushner  intended to resign  from his position with cadre in january but didn t do so until may according to kushner s lawyer  it was simply  an administrative error   we re sure his art collection valued at between   million and   million was merely an oversight  too  but  according to the lawyer  the art collection was just for  personal enjoyment   and had nothing to do with investment purposes and then there s the kushner s   billion in loans that he failed to disclose previously  those loans were from more than  lenders it gets worse mr  kushner has also filed revisions to a form required to obtain a security clearance that  in its initial form  didn t list contacts between him and foreign government officials  he subsequently submitted information about  over  calls or meetings with representatives of more than  countries   ms  gorelick has said in a statement  those contacts weren t made public the trump crime family s mounting conflicts of interest are being paraded out after more and more information is revealed  the trumps seem to suffer from selective memory issues  as for jared  it s always the quiet ones that you should watch  we re sure that mr  mueller is watching this spectacle  too photo by olivier douliery   pool getty images
