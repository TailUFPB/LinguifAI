if donald trump really wants an apology from espn  he ll need to issue a significant public apology to president obama first at least that s what cnn host don lemon told tmz when he was encountered by a crew at an airport this week last week  espn host jemele hill called trump a white supremacist on twitter in response to his remarks blaming  both sides  for the violence at charlottesville and his comment that white supremacists are  fine people  donald trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w  other white supremacists   hill wrote and it s true  trump has been very reluctant to criticize white supremacists and does so very weakly when he finally does  and even then he soon reverses himself well  it didn t take long for trump s team of snowflakes to cry foul  white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders abused her position by calling for espn to fire hill then trump attacked espn and demanded an apology on twitter espn is paying a really big price for its politics  and bad programming   people are dumping it in record numbers  apologize for untruth   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    far  trump has not received an apology from espn or hill  instead  hill expressed regret that her personal remarks on her personal twitter account caused grief for her employers  she stood by her remarks about trump and according to don lemon  if trump really wants an apology he should start by apologizing to president obama for promoting birtherism  i think when the president worked for nbc at the apprentice  and he said that barack obama was not born here  and he called barack obama a racist  if he apologizes for that  then maybe espn should apologize  here s the video via youtube frankly  trump doesn t deserve an apology at all  but he definitely owes president obama several apologies  trump has repeatedly smeared obama over the years  especially since taking office even though it s considered seriously bad taste to bash your predecessor in the way trump has been doing but trump worst offense committed against obama is the perpetuation of the racist birther claims that he repeatedly pushed  especially on fox news trump should have to apologize for that  but he won t because he thinks he s the only one who is ever owed an apology  trump plays the victim card all the time  but you never heard president obama whine like trump does because obama has true class  obama rose above the abuse while trump throws temper tantrums like a petulant child over the smallest of slights the difference between hill and trump is hill called it like it is while trump pushed damnable lies that had already been repeatedly debunked he should be ashamed of himself featured image  zach gibson   pool getty images
