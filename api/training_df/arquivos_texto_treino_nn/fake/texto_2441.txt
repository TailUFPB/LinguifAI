donald trump does not care about jewish people  if he did  he would have strongly condemned anti semitism long ago instead of pandering to groups that commit it in cities across the country on monday  jewish community centers were evacuated after receiving bomb threats this is yet another escalation of the attack on jewish people in america since trump was elected in november  hate crimes are on the rise  and so is anti semitism  trump has been repeatedly called upon to condemn anti semitism but he has refused to do so or only weakly does so because he would lose his supporters on the extreme right wing on tuesday  a full day after the bomb threats  trump finally made a short statement pathetically denouncing anti semitism  the anti semitic threats targeting our jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil   trump said of course  trump has contributed to this hate by ignoring it and has insulted jews ever since taking office a month ago shortly after trump s late statement  anne frank center for mutual respect executive director steven goldstein scolded trump in a statement  the president s sudden acknowledgement is a band aid on the cancer of anti semitism   he began  his statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting anti semitism  yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record  make no mistake  the antisemitism coming out of this administration is the worst we have ever seen from any administration the white house repeatedly refused to mention jews in its holocaust remembrance  and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of holocaust denial  and it was only yesterday  president s day  that jewish community centers across the nation received bomb threats  and the president said absolutely nothing when president trump responds to anti semitic proactively and in real time  and without pleas and pressure  that s when we ll be able to say this president has turned a corner  this is not that moment    potus  realdonaldtrump do not make us jews settle for crumbs of condescension  what are you going to do about  antsemitism in  whitehouse pic twitter com   annefrankcenter us    annefrankcenter  february    s campaign was heavily supported by nazis and trump even hired a nazi by making steve bannon his top adviser  so while trump s statement on tuesday is a start  it s not enough because his anti semitic supporters still believe he is one of them and that he doesn t really believe what he s saying when he  condemns  them  that s because trump s statement was weak and his previous actions and words make it clear that he is not a friend to jews featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
