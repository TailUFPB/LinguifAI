her viral post won her the title of  racist of the week  june pridmore somehow got a job working as the vice president of loan operations at a regions bank in alabama  but after investigating a recent facebook post she wrote  pridmore no longer has a job in an atrocious  incoherent  and racist post featuring multiple misspellings and poor grammar that make one wonder how the bank picked her for the job in the first place  pridmore ranted about her support of donald trump and trashed president obama and his wife first lady michelle obama  i voted him in   pridmore began in reference to trump   i like him  he has a beautiful wife unlike the ugly and embarrassing woman  for lack of a better word   in the white house now  ms  trump s face would make michele  sic  o bama  sic  a sunday face  seriously  does this women not have spellcheck  i m certainly glad  he has a lot of money because she he  sic  won t be bought out like barack  sic   socialist muslim o bama  sic  or his wife or all those host of relatives they have in the whitehouse  sic  for us to support  oh  you mean his two kids and mother in law  that s only three people  and two of them really didn t have a choice since they are kids  on the other hand  donald trump s family is way bigger and they ve all made a mint mooching off the government and taxpayer dollars  plus  it is costing taxpayers   million a day to protect trump in his new york trump tower apartment but primore still wasn t done  she ranted about president obama s vacations  which are less than the number of vacations president bush and president reagan took during their presidencies  and trump has already expressed his desire to be a part time president who spends most days at his golden tower or on the golf course instead of in the white house working and then she said this  if any idiot out there thinks that is justified  you deserved him as president  i prefer a man who can buy michele  sic  and barack and sell them several times over  yep  she went there  a definite reference to slavery and she went on to bitch about people who are unemployed  calling them  lazy non working takers  here s an image of the post via facebook this post was too much for regions bank  who fired pridmore after receiving many complaints bank spokesman jeremy king announced the canning in a statement  we appreciate the concerns shared about offensive social media comments that were made through an associate s personal facebook account  we want you to know that we share those concerns  those comments do not reflect our values as a company or the way we do business  the associate is no longer an employee of the company  so now pridmore is unemployed and has the new title   racist of the week   of course that title won t pay the bills unless donald trump has position open for another ignorant racist  maybe she can use jeff sessions as a reference featured image  facebook
