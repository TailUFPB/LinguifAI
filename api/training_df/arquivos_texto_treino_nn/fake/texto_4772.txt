you know  because in fantasyland republicans never questioned the citizenship of america s first black president but that s exactly what they did for years and donald trump led the charge by going on or calling into fox news every chance he could in order to demand president obama s birth certificate it was trump who constantly claimed president obama was born in kenya even though hawaii newspapers from the time announce obama s birth trump and his birther fans were finally utterly humiliated when president obama released his birth certificate to the public and now that birtherism is coming back to bite trump on the ass as he tries to convince black voters that he isn t a racist part of the reason why black voters reject trump is because he questioned the citizenship of president obama simply because he is black  but trump wants everyone to pretend he didn t say any nasty things about president obama and trump pawn rudy giuliani is demanding that democrats apologize for trump s birtherism giuliani  who has taken to forgetting about   recently  appeared on cnn with jake tapper on sunday and was grilled because trump has not apologized for his birtherism  many african americans say they are still troubled by mr  trump having suggested over and over  falsely  that the first african american president was born in africa and thus ineligible to be president  tapper began giuliani immediately blamed hillary clinton for starting the birther conspiracy  but tapper quickly fact checked giuliani  which forced him to blame clinton s campaign instead giuliani then attempted to portray trump as a hero for  resolving  the conspiracy  claiming that black people  have a faulty memory  he literally thinks black people should thank trump for being a birther but tapper was quick to remind giuliani that it was president obama who resolved the conspiracy by releasing his birth certificate in  while trump was still pushing his birtherism four years later in february  when he told cpac that he thinks the birth certificate is fake  so apparently trump thinks it hasn t been resolved  thus blowing giuliani s claim out of the water  should he just apologize for this if he really wants to reach out to minority voters   tapper asked giuliani replied by demanding that democrats apologize for calling trump s birtherism racist and went on to bash president obama  if everybody apologized for all the things they said in politics  all we would be doing on television shows is apologizing  maybe all the democrats should apologize for calling donald trump a racist and calling him all kinds of terrible names and it gets a little silly  food stamps have gone up two and a half times under barack obama   he added   he should be ashamed of himself  jobs should have gone up two and a half times  my only point is that many african americans are still mad about donald trump having tried to invalidate barack obama by claiming he was born in africa   tapper responded before giving up and moving on here s the video via youtube giuliani seems to be forgetting that the recession that began under george w  bush and the republicans in  caused more families to need food stamps in the first place  which is why the number of people on food stamps has gone up  also  president obama has set a record for the most consecutive months of jobs created and is actually one of the best job creating presidents over the last  years once again  giuliani gets caught talking out of his ass and he must be truly desperate if he is resorting to demanding an apology from democrats for trump s racism featured image  screenshot
