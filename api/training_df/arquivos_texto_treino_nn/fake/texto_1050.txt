at this point  every republican who refuses to have a spine and stand up to donald trump s ignorance and tyranny is just as guilty of endangering the country as america s unworthy potus   and one goper is letting them know it recently  former u s  rep  bob inglis  r sc  trashed his fellow gopers for being so weak and  whimpering  when faced with trump s numerous scandals  particularly russia s possible interference in the  election  directly calling out how weak the republican party has been at upholding their own values and loyalty to the u s  constitution  inglis stated that conservatives need to get their act together and actually start taking the russian meddling seriously  this is particularly noteworthy because former director of homeland security jeh johnson says  it s a fact  that russia interfered in the election  inglis said  the president needs to understand that this is an investigation of an attack by a hostile power at the very heart of our republic  if he were wise  he would open up the doors and say   let s look into it  come and see what all i ve got because we ve got to know what happened here  while trump has never been one to take advice from anyone  no matter how much smarter they are   inglis suggested that the best way trump could get on america s good side is to simply stop getting in the way of the investigation and actually cooperate for once pointing out a double standard in the republican party  inglis stated that if it had been hillary clinton as potus and she had fired fbi director james comey for reopening an investigation on her email server  the gop would be up in arms  he said  republicans would be howling about that  we would be talking about impeachment  we d be talking about obstruction of justice  but as it is  we re sort of whimpering  we re not after this thing  we need to really be after it  you can watch inglis shred the gop for its hypocrisy below featured image via pool  getty images
