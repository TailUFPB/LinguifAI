 republicans on the federal communications commission have net neutrality in their sites again  this time  trump appointed fcc chairman  ajit pai  is leading the charge to undo obama era regulations that gave the fcc the power to restrict internet providers  isps  from having complete control over broadband delivery  pai plans to ignore public protests  industry expert recommendations  and court opinions to hand over the reigns of the internet to isp s ajit pai is an ex lawyer for verizon and staffer for jeff sessions  he claims to support a free and open internet  but he does not agree with the fcc s rules  pai would rather have congress   who s members think it s cute to use the word  internets  protect net neutrality than an agency full of industry experts  the internet was not broken in    pai said during thursday s hearing   the utility style regulations known as title ii were and are like the proverbial sledgehammer being wielded against the flea  except that here  there was no flea  the fcc voted thursday afternoon to roll back president obama s  policies using pai s rule changing proposal titled  restoring internet freedom   the rule change would strip the fcc of oversight abilities  and it would result in a report on the economic impact of strict net neutrality rules  the lone democrat on the fcc commission  mignon clyburn  renamed the proposition  destroying internet freedom  critics like commissioner clyburn argue that fair competition in the internet must be protected among other things  without net neutrality  many argue  isp s can suppress first amendment rights by slowing down some webpages and applications  they could also alter speed and access to certain websites based on their bottom lines  for instance  if hulu agrees to pay comcast more than netflix  comcast could potentially slow netflix s streaming and download speeds  now that s scary not only does rolling back net neutrality protections disrupt internet fairness  without them it could become harder for those in rural  less populated areas to receive adequate coverage  a past report by the fcc concluded that net neutrality protects broadband users from  discriminatory practices that whittle away  public internet   it went on to assert that  openness  is not just another  principle  the value of open networks is not a novel concept  but the commission must act to ensure that the genius of the open internet is not lost  net neutrality rules are particularly important for rural broadband subscribers who may have only one provider   the report states that the fcc needs to be instrumental in watching for and adjudicating discriminatory practices why do republicans  like pai  want to put an end to net neutrality an april wall street journal op ed hails pai s plan because it would  revert to the bipartisan consensus that the internet should be  unfettered by federal or state regulation   supporters want freedom for the isp s   freedom   democrat commissioner clyburn points out  that the courts have ruled against three times alas  the fcc voted   to begin the process to peel back neutrality rules  her words of dissent fell on deaf ears  but they may come to be an epithet if the proposition passes  if you unequivocally trust that your broadband provider will always put the public interest over self interest  then the destroying internet freedom  is for you  you can watch the fcc net neutrality debate here
