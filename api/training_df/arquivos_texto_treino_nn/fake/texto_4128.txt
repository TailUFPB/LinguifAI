until today  not one national poll had clinton leading with male voters  some have gotten close  but donald trump has always managed to lock it up  the gender gap that we have seen the last several elections was looking like a repeat for  but now a new poll released the day of the third and final presidential debate shows clinton now   for the first time   is leading with men  the newest poll from bloomberg politics shows clinton edging out trump by  points with men   to   and  points overall     the poll was conducted from october   with responses from   likely voters so a week after the game changing audio tape was leaked   in which trump admits to sexually assaulting women   men have started to turn against the republican nominee  and for good reason clinton is already gaining in republican strongholds   white  college educated women  cuban americans  young republicans  vietnamese americans  and now men  such gains have turned traditionally red states like arizona  georgia and texas into reachable victories for democrats with trump under performing romney in key swing states  and red states   trump cannot afford to lose his key voting demographics  but the damage from the tape and the accusations of sexual assault have hurt him tremendously republican men have distanced themselves from trump after the revelations were leaked  invoking their wives and daughters and granddaughters as reasons they cannot support the gop nominee  it s not clear if the shift in male support for clinton comes from independent or republican defectors  but the numbers are slowly inching clinton s way with less than  days until election day  trump is going to have to pivot hard if he hopes of bringing back all the defectors into his camp  with early voting already underway  in which millions have already cast their ballots  the window of opportunity may have passed featured image via justin sullivan getty images
