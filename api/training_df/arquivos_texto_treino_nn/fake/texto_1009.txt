republicans who call themselves  pro life  are presenting a health care plan that would literally kill tens of thousands of people by implementing devastating cuts to medicaid and sister simone campbell  leader of the advocacy group nuns on a bus  is wondering how gopers can give themselves that moniker while putting our most needy  including the elderly and children  at risk campbell called the affordable care act a  life saving bill  and in an op ed for the hill she said she wants to call their bluff on their proclaimed pro life stance  i am outraged to see allegedly pro life republicans put forward a healthcare bill that will strip millions of people of their healthcare  not only that  but this bill preys on the most vulnerable  this is antithetical to any faith   she writes   the house and senate healthcare proposals are the antithesis of a pro life stance and needs to be named as such  people will lose their lives if this bill becomes law  then the sister hit republicans where it hurts  with facts  it used to be very difficult for women to find insurance coverage for pre natal and maternity care  under current law  maternal health  pregnancy and postpartum services  is an essential benefit  which insurers must offer without charging extra   she continued   this is a pro life benefit   but the gop is set to eliminate the essential health benefits  including maternity care  for millions of expecting mothers  campbell noted that trumpcare  would bring us back to a time when  maternity riders  forced women to pay more than many could afford just to bring a child into the world   this is not pro life  she pointed to the republicans proposing  to cut and cap medicaid funding for people with disabilities and those living below the poverty level in our nation  and she goes on to say that   percent of births in the united states are paid for by medicaid  campbell writes that pro life  members of congress are actually dismissing the needs of mothers and their newborn children  supporting medicaid funding is a pro life stance   she says  campbell also notes that medicaid benefits senior citizens who live in nursing homes   including many catholic sisters who have served their entire lives tending to the most vulnerable  she points to medicaid helping those with disabilities and says that  republican efforts to cut medicaid funding arbitrarily will jeopardize their lives and wellbeing  taking money away from seniors  people in poverty and people with disabilities is wrong   she writes   everyone has a right to live in dignity  the sister says republicans are only concerned with lining the pockets of the wealthiest and are doing so at the expense of medicaid and our most vulnerable people  indeed  the cuts to medicaid will afford the wealthy a nice tax break while lower income americans die and or suffer  if republicans are truly pro life   she writes   then they will place people  not corporate interests  at the center of their decision making  and  when people are healthier  we all do better  she called out her  pro life colleagues  so my pro life colleagues  listen up  to be pro life requires us to care about all of life  not just birth or death  mothers and their infants need medical coverage  the disabled and the elderly need the promise that they can live in dignity for their entire natural life  this means that we must not cap individual or state expenditures for medicaid or remove services from the defined benefits  it also means that we must not block grant medicaid to the states or institute a per capita cap she concluded her op ed by calling on senators to reject trump republicare and requested to  have a real conversation that doesn t include  million americans losing their healthcare  amen  sister image via screen capture
