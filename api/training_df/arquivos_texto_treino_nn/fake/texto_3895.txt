paul ryan just gave another one of his notoriously lukewarm endorsements of donald trump  intent on walking the thin line between backing his party s nominee and dumping trump  the speaker of the house has tried to set himself up to come out smelling like a rose regardless of the outcome of tomorrow s election during a radio interview on monday  ryan conceded that  yes  trump won the republican nomination  fair and square   however  when conservative host charlie sykes asked if the gop was now trump s party  ryan made it as clear as he could that no  the republican party does not belong to donald trump  it is no one person s party  donald trump won the primary fair and square   ryan said  as a party leader  as the highest elected official in the party  i have always felt a duty to the process  to democracy  to the primary voter who must be respected  and he won this fair and square   ryan added   but no one person controls this party  this is a bottom up  organic grassroots party based on conservative principles  what a ringing endorsement to give on the eve of the election   insert sarcasm here  ryan was slow to endorse trump and has repeatedly condemned the bombastic billionaire s offensive actions  ryan denounced the muslim ban as unconstitutional and declared trump s attacks on the mexican american judge presiding over a trump university lawsuit as the  textbook definition  of racism  but ryan just doesn t have the cajones to stand up and walk away from trump sykes asked the speaker about the long list of women who have come forward to accuse trump of sexually assaulting them after the access hollywood tape was leaked  in which trump bragged about committing sexual assault  suddenly  ryan leaped back onto the trump train  what do you think helps  ron johnson and mike gallagher and all our candidates across the country more in the closing two days of an election  having party discord and having party leaders snub each other  or unifying the republican party and focusing and prosecuting our case against hillary clinton   ryan responded  what helps republicans more  infighting or unifying  focusing on clinton or focusing on our differences as republicans   the speaker continued   i don t want to harm our team going into the election  i want to unify our team going into the election so as many of our candidates as possible can win this election  either ryan can t make up his mind or he is trying to play both sides  ummm  weasel much featured image via alex wong getty images and mark wilson getty images
