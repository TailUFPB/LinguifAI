trump administration officials who were under pressure from the white house scrapped a study which found that refugees had brought in more government revenue overall than they had cost in benefits  the new york times reports  the trump administration has been unable to rationalize its move to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the united states next year  so it rejected a study by the department of health and human services which concluded that refugees brought in   billion more in government revenues over the past ten years than they cost the new york times reports the draft report  which was obtained by the new york times  contradicts a central argument made by advocates of deep cuts in refugee totals as president trump faces an oct   deadline to decide on an allowable number  the issue has sparked intense debate within his administration as opponents of the program  led by mr  trump s chief policy adviser  stephen miller  assert that continuing to welcome refugees is too costly and raises concerns about terrorism alt right leader richard spencer has claimed that he was a mentor of stephen miller s and said that his mentee is a white nationalist  miller denied that affiliation with spencer  but his actions prove that he s an extremist the study concluded that refugees  contributed an estimated    billion in revenues to all levels of government  between  and  via the payment of federal  state and local taxes   overall  this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the  year period  at   billion  the white house claims that the study was politically motivated  this leak was delivered by someone with an ideological agenda  not someone looking at hard data   a white house spokesman said   the actual report pursuant to the presidential memorandum shows that refugees with few skills coming from war torn countries take more government benefits from the department of health and human services than the average population  and are not a net benefit to the u s  economy  according to two sources  miller personally intervened to ensure that only the costs   and not any fiscal benefit   of the program were considered  so it appears that he intentionally left out a few major details trump has filled his administration with swamp like creatures  including steve bannon  who once played a large role in the white house  and stephen miller who still occupies trump s ear photo  alex wong via getty images
