we tried to warn you from the summer of  onward  democrats tried to warn the american public that russia found a useful idiot in donald trump  he was their puppet  their strongman  their way into the american political scene  no one wanted to believe it when the dnc and dscc  along with various lawmakers   including nancy pelosi  were hacked  we said it was russia  the intelligence agencies agreed  no one wanted to believe it  and the mainstream media brushed it aside when the podesta emails were hacked and dumped onto the internet for all to read  it was traced back to russian thugs  no one wanted to believe it  they said wikileaks and their leader  julian assange  were doing their due diligence for a more transparent government when hillary clinton  at the last presidential debate  told  million viewers that the russian federation was working tooth and nail to help donald trump  we brushed it off  and accused the democrats of being sore losers  conspiracy riddled  and scared of losing an election  which we did  watch clinton hit it home  if only we listened hillary dropped this exact same info about russia in front of  million viewers in october  but i guess no one listened because  emails pic twitter com   ess   scottyliterati  december     the cia agrees   russia played a major role in helping donald trump win the presidency  they meddled in our sacred  democratic elections to help a would be  two bit dictator wannabe rise to power a report found as the summer turned to fall  russian hackers turned almost all their attention to the democrats  virtually all the emails they released publically were potentially damaging to clinton and the democrats  the official told reuters  that was a major clue to their intent   the official said   if all they wanted to do was discredit our political system  why publicize the failings of just one party  especially when they have a target like trump  trump has nominated a secretary of state candidate  rex tillerman  who is a friend to russia and vladimir putin  this is not a coincidence  nor is it a surprise  he has nominated a would be national security advisor  michael flynn  an ally to russia and spreader of fake news  this also is not a coincidence  this is the reality of the united states  post obama no  this was not some  pound guy in his parent s basement  as trump would suggest  this is a world power that has their hands in several world crises   syria  ukraine and so forth so while republicans   and indeed left wing defectors from the democratic party   hyper focused on the clinton podesta emails  trump was on the cusp of a victory thanks in part to russian hackings   which may even extend to voter hackings in november the russians may or may not have physically intervened on november  to help donald trump win  however  it has now been proven by  security agencies  both private and governmental   that russia played a key role in souring the public s perception about clinton and the democrats it wasn t just because of hackings  the kremlin paid and trained trolls to flood the internet with fake news and multiple twitter facebook accounts to create a world of hate for hillary clinton  a world of praise for donald trump luckily  republicans like john mccain and lindsey graham are starting to see the big picture  but its not enough  they  along with their conservative colleagues and liberal adversaries  were a ok with smearing clinton with russian propagated lies if it meant having an r in the white house when it comes to donald trump and russia  we democrats hate to say it  but  we told you so  american democracy has been sold to the highest bidder  and russia paid the highest price featured image via justin sullivan getty images
