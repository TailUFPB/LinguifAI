this year s election is really shaping up to be one of the most ridiculous ever in the history of the republic  and adding to this bizarre circus is the fact that dr  mehmet oz  noted tv host and alleged scam artist  will be the one reading republican presidential nominee donald trump s health report  however  not the whole thing oz told fox news  brian kilmeade about how trump has instructed the release  and when kilmeade asked   oh  it s still going to be his decision   oz replied  it s his decision  you know  i  the metaphor for me is it s the doctor s office  the studio  so i m not going to ask him questions he doesn t want to have answered  so basically  we re only going to hear what trump wants us to hear like a scripted reality show  which  btw  all  reality  shows are  upon hearing the news of dr  oz releasing trump s medical report  legendary entertainer extraordinaire cher took to twitter to let us all know how she feels about it and because cher tweets in fluent emoji  her tweet is translated here  why is dr  oz letting trump pimp him out   oz is bound by ethics   is he so hungry for ratings he ll let trump use him like guys at a frat party  why is dr oz letting trump pimp him out oz is bound by ethics  is he so hungry  he ll let trump use him like guys at a frat party   cher   cher  september     but she s not wrong  the fact that this is being accepted as legitimate by the american people should be clear evidence that the movie idiocracy has now become reality  and it s f cking terrifying featured photo by ethan miller  getty images for acma twitter
