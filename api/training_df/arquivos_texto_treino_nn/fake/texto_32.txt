on wednesday  donald trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider  he has declared that the united states now officially recognizes the city of jerusalem as the capital of israel  and announced plans to move the american embassy from tel aviv to the holy city the only problem is  the city isn t just holy to the country of israel while trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land  that s really a misleading statement  since declaring jerusalem as the capital of israel in effect gives the city to the israelis  a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over saeb erekat  the chief palestinian negotiator in the peace process  was quick to respond  saying that trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos  violence  mustafa marghouti  an independent palestinian politician  told al jazeera that  this is not a single act  this us administration that did not speak even once about a two state solution  this american administration did not say or mention the words  palestinian state  once  this american administration has failed to exercise any pressure on israel on the issue of settlements  although israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than  percent since president trump was elected  many expect to see outrage across the middle east as news of the decision comes in the european union  for their part  insists that their position has not changed  and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   israel and palestine just as he does here at home  trump seems to be uniting people against him  even some that seem to be unlikely pairings  both the president of turkey  recep tayyip erdogan  and king abdullah ii of jordan warned that ignoring the palestinian  muslim  and christian rights in jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism  but the decision does make trump s evangelical supporters in america happy  their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the jewish state and evangelicalism  according to christian traditions  the jews will all die in the apocalypse  as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs no wonder they re mostly republicans watch trump s announcement here featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
