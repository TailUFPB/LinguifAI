alec baldwin didn t even wait to taste trump s salty yet delicious tears after his brilliant saturday night live smackdown of the  nominee  baldwin perfectly captured the disaster that was trump s performance during the second presidential debate  but the true magic happened on twitter   no  we re not talking about the actor nonchalantly retweeting trump s tantrum  we re talking about how he perfectly anticipated the meltdown and left a response before the show was even filmed after the show aired  the donald had a full blown meltdown on twitter  because where else     one baldwin retweeted to make sure the world saw what a mess trump is while the world recognized how badass this was   baldwin essentially firing a rocket launcher at trump s stupid plane and walking away without so much as looking at the explosion   what many are missing is that he didn t even need to say a word  he already did that on friday in anticipation of the  gop nominee s oh so predictable meltdown  before trump said a word  baldwin had a response prepared   fuck your feelings   he even used a photo of one of the donald s  deplorables  to do it it s disheartening that the gop can t field someone who won t be baited into a full blown tantrum by someone making a few jokes about him  but this is where we re at  be sure to vote blue on november   not november  as trump told his  deplorables  at a rally recently   this is probably the first time we ve had the literal life or death of our nation riding on an election featured image via getty images paul hawthorn
