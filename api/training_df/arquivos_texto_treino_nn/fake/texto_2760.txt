how can we expect our kids to do their homework when the nominee for the top education post in the nation won t even bother doing her own homework a senate questionnaire is not exactly difficult to fill out  you provide your own answers to the questions asked and then your answers are evaluated by the committee tasked with considering your nomination it s easy for anyone who is intelligent and hard working but rather than present her own work  secretary of education nominee betsy devos chose to just copy and paste her answers verbatim from other sources without citations according to the washington post in answering a set of questions from sen  patty murray  d wash   on how she would address bullying of lgbt students  devos wrote   every child deserves to attend school in a safe  supportive environment where they can learn  thrive  and grow  that sentence is almost identical to language used by vanita gupta  head of the justice department s civil rights division under president barack obama  in a news release announcing the administration s controversial guidance to schools on how to accommodate transgender students  every child deserves to attend school in a safe  supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow   gupta said in the may  release oh  and that s not all  devos also copied directly from the the department she wants to destroy in one response  to a question about whether she would continue the practice of publishing a list of schools under title ix civil rights investigations  devos said   opening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that the office for civil rights  ocr  has made a determination about the merits of the complaint  that language mirrors an education department website   opening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that ocr has made a determination with regard to the merits of the complaint  devos committed plagiarism throughout the  page questionnaire  apparently  she was too lazy to make a real effort  it s either that or she s just not smart enough to answer easy questions  either way  plagiarism is something students are taught not to do in school and when they get caught they get punished for it by getting a failing grade on the assignment or even expulsion but devos is not a student in school  she s an adult who is up for the top education post in the country  and frankly  that makes her plagiarism much worse and more embarrassing she should immediately withdraw her name from the nomination or the senate should reject her  it would be entirely inappropriate for the secretary of education to be someone who refuses to do their own homework in their own words  surely  we want our secretary of education to be someone with integrity and real intelligence  betsy devos has neither featured image via drew angerer getty images
