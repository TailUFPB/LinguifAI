ronald reagan is rolling in his grave donald trump s campaign is guilty of colluding with russia and that became even clearer on friday morning when nbc revealed that a fifth person attended trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer in addition to paul manafort  jared kushner  trump jr   and kremlin liked attorney natalia veselnitskya  the meeting at trump tower also included rinat akhmetshin  a former soviet army counterintelligence officer who may still have connections with russian intelligence that s right  trump s campaign worked with a soviet spy in an effort to win the  election here s the report via twitternbc exclusive  a russian american lobbyist a fmr soviet counter intel officer was also in don jr  russian lawyer mtg pic twitter com   steve kopack   stevekopack  july    this isn t enough to oust trump and his goons and put them all in prison  the republican party has truly lost all sense of patriotism and duty this is proof that trump s campaign colluded with russia to win the  election  and americans across the country should be outraged enough to demand immediate consequences trump jr  didn t do himself any favors either by lying about how many russians he met with during an interview with sean hannity  trump jr  claimed that the emails he released contained  everything  on his meetings with russians  trump s top propaganda dog took trump jr  at his word  only to be humiliated this morning by the breaking news trump and his team have repeatedly tried to sweep this scandal under the rug for days now  but more bombshells continue to drop  damaging any shred of credibility the white house has left let s keep in mind that the soviet union wanted nothing more than to destroy the united states and our democracy for several decades  both republicans and democrats worked to prevent that from happening  but only the republicans are just fine with russian meddling in the present day  if this had happened thirty years ago  republicans would have had trump jr  arrested by now  the only reason they continue to protect trump and his crime family is because they don t want to hurt their own power  they have literally chosen power and party over country and the constitution they swore to defend and russia and vladimir putin couldn t be happier about it featured image  john moore getty images
