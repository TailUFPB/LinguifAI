we all know that man baby donald trump hates the first amendment when it doesn t favor him  so you can only imagine how upset he is that women are using their freedom of speech to accuse him of sexually assaulting them  as more and more allegations have come to the surface  the republican nominee has promised to sue these women when the election is over   as if he hasn t made them suffer through enough fortunately  trump s threat to sue has attracted the attention of a few prominent first amendment attorneys  who have recently come forward and said they would defend trump s victims against him  pro bono  one of these high profile lawyers is ted boutrous of the law firm gibson dunn  who tweeted that he would defend these women for free earlier this month twitteron saturday  trump repeated his threat to file lawsuits against his accusers  and boutrous once again renewed his commitment to going up against trump  he even noted that since his announcement  several other lawyers were interested in joining his cause twitterone of these attorneys is actually harvard law professor laurence tribe  who boutrous thanked for his interest twitter twitterit looks like trump is going down  even if he tries to somehow save himself  trump has put his accusers through hell  and he continues to  poorly  discredit their numerous allegations and trash them in the media  as if these women haven t already been through enough  the help of these attorneys will certainly make all the difference as they go up against one of the most vile human beings american history has ever seen  the only thing more wonderful than seeing trump lose to hillary clinton in november would be seeing trump behind bars for the numerous rapes and fraudulent activities he s committed over his lifetime featured image via brian blanco   getty images
