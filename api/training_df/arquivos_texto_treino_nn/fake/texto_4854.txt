it s not illegal  but it s long been considered unethical for journalists to pay their sources  it still happens  but generally by tabloids  wikileaks  julian assange believes that his is not a tabloid  and in fact  he believes that he is so far above mainstream media sources  that it s okay for him to pay for stories  which is exactly what he s doing  trying to dig up dirt on both hillary clinton and donald trump  police rewards product results  so do journalistic rewards   a spokesperson for sunshine press  of which wikileaks is a project  told huffington post in an email   those who take the truth seriously leave no stone unturned to find it  as for the ethics  well  wikileaks breaths rarified air  some lesser publications have poor quality control and as a consequence are not able to maintain accuracy when financial incentives are involved  or frankly  even when they are not   the spokesperson said  pointing to the new york times publishing false information about iraq having weapons of mass destruction as an example   wikileaks  vetting process is strong enough not to be affected by an increase in source contributions  wait  what  wikileaks has a vetting process  this is the same organization that published more than  strains of malware in its most recent email dump  oh  and there s a reason they re called email dumps   wikileaks doesn t vet  they simply dump  leaving other journalists to sort through to find the real information  while the new york times certainly doesn t deserve the level of respect they had before the iraq war  i can say with certainty that they ve never infected my computer with malware this isn t the first time wikileaks has paid to play  last year  they offered    for information relating to the trans pacific partnership  tpp   earlier in the month  wikileaks offered    for anyone with information that might link the murder of a dnc staffer in washington d c  to the hillary clinton campaign  all they ended up doing was fueling alex jones type conspiracy theorists assange has received a lot of criticism from those on the left  claiming that he s trying to put his thumb on the scale of our electoral process in an attempt to defeat clinton  i m sure his claim that he s also going after trump is a convincing cover for that  but think about it  assange is offering     trump could easily double or triple that to keep someone quiet  yes  the clintons have money  but not trump money featured image via carl court getty images
