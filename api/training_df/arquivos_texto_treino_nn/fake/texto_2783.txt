the trump administration has a twitter problem  donald trump can t seem to control his narcissistic twitter rants  but even his press secretary  sean spicer  is far too impulsive  he retweeted a video that he thought was a flattering portrayal  but the truth is  it was a satirical onion video  and if he had watched till the end  he would realize it wasn t flattering at all a good part of spicer s job is to monitor the media  you would think he would read all the way through  or at least who the source was  but instead  spicer tweeted   you nailed it  period   to the onion the video  entitled   things to know about sean spicer   should have let spicer in on the joke in the very first item  it said his role in the trump administration is  to provide the american public with robust and clearly articulated misinformation  okay  perhaps he missed the  mis  in  misinformation   next the second one was innocuous enough  it said he was formerly senior correspondent on npr s national desk  fair enough  next clearly  spicer didn t get to the third one because in that  the onion called his speaking style  defensive  as for whether spicer has lied to the press  the answer to   is possibly above most trumpian s heads  one s own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of one s experience  the last one could be what spicer was referring to when he said  nailed it   the question was   does he nail the pocket square or does he nail the pocket square  spicer is almost as good at the pocket square as he is at  alternative facts   so the onion s answer was snowy white  quarter inch of clearance   you better believe he does oddly  that tweet is still up  but people aren t letting him forget it  of course  as one twitter user reminded us  spicer also tweeted two passwords last week  in other words  he s clearly not too bright you nailed it  period  https   t co   sean spicer   seanspicer  january
