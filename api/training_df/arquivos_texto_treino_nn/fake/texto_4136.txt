donald trump is obsessed with himself  so obsessed that he covers his wall with covers of magazines and newspapers that have his face on them  because  it s cheaper than wallpaper   well just recently the crusader  the kkk s official newspaper  has endorsed trump  do you think that ll make it up on his wall  or does he not  know anything about them   in the past when talk of david duke and the kkk endorsing trump was circulating he claimed to know nothing about them  shouldn t someone who s the potential president of the united states know what the kkk is  you can see more on that here so while donald trump claims to have know idea who the klu klux klan is  there have been ties from trump s inner circle to the kkk  with his support taking a sharp nosedive in the polls  it s not hard to imagine him accepting support from just about anybody  or maybe this time he ll pretend he doesn t know what the kkk is again
