days after testifying in front of congress and after requesting more resources for the russian investigation  fbi director james comey was fired on tuesday night  effective immediately the trump administration is blaming comey s handling of the hillary clinton emails  which makes no sense whatsoever because trump loved comey s handling of the emails in october  trump tried to make the case that he fired comey for being mean to hillary clinton  but even the most rabid trump supporters have to acknowledge that his  lock her up   slogan is completely incompatible with trump s given rationale it doesn t take a tin foil conspiracy theorist to imagine that the real reason for the comey firing is that he was getting too close to the truth in investigating trump s russia connections  npr imagines even more scenarios  like the fact that comey was becoming too big and was stepping on poor little donnie s ego  it s becoming more and more likely though  that there were just two reasons comey was fired and both of them should scare the hell out of you according to two sources that cnn is calling  close to comey   the two reasons comey was fired were   confirms everything we ve been assuming since the news broke tuesday night     though  while not at all surprising  is almost more frightening  trump had to have approached comey at some point  demanding his loyalty  that s third rate banana republic dictator crap  it makes one wonder just how many people have had to make an oath of loyalty  not to the constitution  but to trump  maybe it s just the people who might have damaging goods on the administration or maybe it s every single person in his administration  which could explain why hundreds of jobs still remain unfilled within the executive branch loyalty oaths or no loyalty oaths  the trump administration s charade when it comes to the handling is quickly coming unraveled  it likely won t be long before comey  and not just sources close to him  are speaking out   and perhaps speaking to congress featured image via zach gibson getty images
