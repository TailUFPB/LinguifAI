nobody can accuse the gop of having it all together  but they are pretty good at having their press releases done ahead of time  unfortunately for them  tonight s announcement was about the vice presidential debate  declaring mike pence the winner  well before the debate even started check it out below   it s really amazing that they can see into the future this is at least one  dewey defeats truman  moment for the gop  back in   the chicago tribune jumped the gun of the presidential election for that year and published that headline  anybody who knows anything at all about american history should know we never had a president dewey   and the tribune has yet to live that gaffe down the gop  though  won t deal in facts tonight  they ll declare pence the winner even if he literally never says a single word  notice what they highlighted  the economy and hillary s emails  tonight s debate started with presidential leadership  and what the vp must do with zero prep should the president become incapacitated pence did do every single thing he could to blame hillary clinton for weak foreign policy  including lying through his teeth about why we pulled our troops out of iraq  he repeated the gop line that hillary chose to pull our troops out and ignored the fact that it was not our choice   it was iraq s choice   however  he s probably gotten some training from trump s people  who try and turn even the most unrelated  irrelevant subjects into something about hillary vox decided to be charitable with their evaluation of the gop s premature ejaculation press release  saying it could be placeholder text on their site  but considering that they also said the  other clear winner  was donald trump  it s really  really hard to see this as anything other than what it is   the gop trying to control the narrative before anything even began featured image by win mcnamee getty images
