donald trump has disgraced the united states and made the country s white house an absolute circus   but he s not done ruining things yet  apparently  the election of trump is also going to ruin disney world according to a report by motherboard  the imagineers at disney world are having a meltdown over having to add this illegitimate president to the hall of presidents  every single potus has been added to this feature in disney world  and now they re faced with a truly awful  president that does not deserve to stand beside the others  but must be included to follow tradition since   several of the animatronic presidents have had speaking parts in the hall s presentation  which includes a history lesson and music  this presents a unique problem for the people tasked with making the trump robot   what should a potus with the vocabulary and speech patterns of a  year old say  surely  anything that comes out of trump s mouth is going to stick out like a sore thumb compared to his wiser  more competent predecessors the people at disney have been torn up about this  but motherboard reports that they ve decided to add him  under the conditions that he doesn t say a damn word  motherboard wrote  motherboard spoke via email and phone to a source close to walt disney imagineering the research and development department behind disney s theme park attractions  and according to the source  donald trump will be in the attraction  but he will probably not have a speaking role  unlike the three presidents immediately before him  the imagineers will likely revert the attraction to its pre  format  where the current president does not speak  while keeping the more realistic  grounded tone of the current show  apparently  disney world is also acknowledging the fact that trump might not be in the white house much longer  motherboard stated  given president trump s current problems  walt disney world might elect to push the attraction s opening date back to the fall and then make further tweaks to the show  featured image is a screenshot
