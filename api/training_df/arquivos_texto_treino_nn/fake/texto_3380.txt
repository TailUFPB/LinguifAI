if someone had called ronald reagan un american for taking on russia  republicans would have thrown a hissy fit but president obama is a black democrat and the republican party has become the party of putin  so of course  conservatives like kellyanne conway would question obama s patriotism for defending our country during an interview on fox news  conway whined about president obama pursuing an investigation of russian interference in our political process as we all know  donald trump openly encouraged russia to commit espionage against our country when their hack of the dnc was revealed this past summer  i will tell you this  russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing   trump said in july   i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press  here s the video via youtube and they obeyed  continually hacking our institutions in an effort to help trump win the presidency so putin would have a puppet in the white house white house press secretary josh earnest pointed out that trump knew about russian meddling all along  and president obama has promised swift retribution against russia but conway is still pretending that russia didn t do anything to help trump and accused president obama of not loving america because he is unwilling to ignore russia s crimes  she even demanded that obama shut down the investigation and pretend the election interference never happened  if you want to shut this down and you actually love the country enough to have the peaceful transition in our great democracy between the obama administration and the trump administration  there are a couple people in pretty prominent positions  one is named obama  one is named hillary clinton  since his people are trying to fight over her election still  they could shut this down  here s the video via youtube ignoring russia s clear espionage against the united states would be a total disservice to the american people and would only embolden russia and other nations to interfere in our political process in future elections  allowing trump to be president would also embolden republicans to seek foreign help in future elections as well  in short  republicans are happy to allow another country to spread propaganda and violate the integrity of our elections as long as it helps them stay in power if anyone is anti american  it s kellyanne conway and donald trump  they re the ones defending putin and russia instead of backing an investigation  they are the ones defending russian espionage against america  and the only reason they want to bury it is because they know trump is an illegitimate president elect featured image  screenshot
