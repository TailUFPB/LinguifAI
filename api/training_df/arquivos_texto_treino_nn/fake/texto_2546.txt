one of trump s biggest supporters just got their ass handed to them for having zero evidence of voter fraud donald trump s lies about voter fraud imploded on monday as cnn tore apart kris kobach  the man stephen miller cited when asked if he had evidence to prove trump s claims miller repeatedly claimed that millions of americans voted illegally in november to explain how trump lost the popular vote to hillary clinton  miller specifically talked about new hampshire  claiming that thousands of people from massachusetts bused in to vote a second time in that state  go to new hampshire   miller said   talk to anybody who s worked in politics there for a long time  everybody s aware of the problem in new hampshire  except that many former and current new hampshire politicians from both parties have criticized trump s claim and when abc host george stephanopoulos asked miller for evidence  he merely referred the media to kansas secretary of state and trump supporter kris kobach on monday  cnn host kate bolduan confronted kobach about miller s claims  miller says  look to you  sir  for the evidence   bolduan said   where is it  on election day     people registered in new hampshire using an out of state driver s license   kobach claimed in response   of those over    just under     so just under half   used a massachusetts driver s license  now  some of those are going to be legit  they re going to be people who just moved to new hampshire  but many of those will be out of state residents who voted in the state  what kobach just said is a mere prediction  in a courtroom  it would be called conjecture because kobach is making an opinion based on incomplete information  you truly do believe that thousands of people came in from massachusetts to vote in new hampshire on election day   bolduan continued in disbelief  we will have data at the end of the month  how many of those   people voted in both new hampshire and in one of the other states   kobach said  admitting that he actually doesn t have evidence  he is only promising that he will have evidence at a later time  probably when whatever right wing organization he is associated with provides their fabricated statistics with no real evidence to support his claims  bolduan pounced and slammed kobach with reality  mr  secretary  wait a second  stephen miller  over the weekend  said thousands did vote illegally  definitively saying that this actually happened  you re saying that there s going to be more data coming at the end of the month  so  do you have the evidence  voter registration does not equal fraudulent votes  kobach claimed that  million americans are registered to vote in two states  which isn t illegal  of course  trump adviser steve bannon is also registered to vote in two states kobach then offered  proof  of trump s claim by whining about cnn not covering the nine cases of voter fraud kansas is prosecuting  bolduan easily picked that  evidence  apart  you have nine cases   bolduan said   six guilty pleas  one dismissed  two pending  that s as of january   nine cases does not rampant widespread voter fraud make  a small minority does not make millions and millions of widespread  rampant votes in this country   bolduan continued   what stephen miller and the president said over the weekend is this is exactly why they lost in new hampshire  not saying they were prospective cases  they were illegal votes  at that point  kobach stumbled his way through the remainder of the interview as bolduan countered his bullshit with facts at every turn here s the full smack down via youtube donald trump s voter fraud claims are a pathetic attempt to stroke his own ego because he can t handle the fact that he lost to a woman and is not a legitimate president  if he is really so concerned about voter fraud  he should call for a new election immediately  but he won t because he is full of shit featured image via screenshot
