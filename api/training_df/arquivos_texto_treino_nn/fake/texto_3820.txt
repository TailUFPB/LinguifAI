before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women  by the pussy  to billy bush  it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trump s glaring faults as a presidential candidate  during the primaries  for example  he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors  it turns out there might be a reason for that   trump was bribing the media   at least that s the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news in her memoire  settle for more   which will be released this week  kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question  in which she asked about the fact that he has called women  fat pigs  dogs  slobs and disgusting animals   that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades  these are only a portion the worst and most controversial of which was this as the election progressed  it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior  he expected  no  demanded that the media kiss his orange ass  if they didn t  he would cut off access  but before that  he tried bribery while kelly couldn t speak for other members of the media  she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels  with full perks  while the attempt clearly didn t work on kelly  she says that with some  their loyalty came cheap  or perhaps not so cheap  this is actually one of the untold stories of the  campaign  i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage   kelly said  he also attempted to woo them with praise  she said  adding   this is smart  because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking  trump tried to work the refs  and some of the refs responded   she said when it became obvious that some reporters were  in the tank  for trump  she alleges in one chapter   certain tv hosts  would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased  she didn t identify them by name or media outlet source  yahookelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trump s treatment of women  the candidate called fox news exec  bill sammon  who told him about the first question  all we heard about  though  during the election  was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering  the insider knowledge said that a woman  in the flint  michigan debate  would ask a question about the flint water while bribing journalists isn t illegal  per say  it is highly unethical  without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics  democracy is impossible featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
