a pastor shamefully lied in defense of donald trump on saturday and joy reid shut him down hard during an interview on msnbc  conservative  christian  pastor darrell scott  who is one of the few black people in america who support the republican nominee  pretended that trump is not a racist and denied that trump had anything to do with the birther movement against president obama trump tried to sell himself to black voters on friday in front of an audience of white people by telling them they have  nothing to lose  by voting for him  that led reid to ask   if donald trump makes a speech to black people when there are none around to hear it  did he make a sound  reid turned to scott and noted that trump has made two appeals to black voters in recent days in places where the black population only makes up about  percent of the total   why is he making those appeals in front of almost exclusively white audiences   she asked scott made excuses for trump  claiming that it doesn t matter where he speaks because all african americans hear him  when pressed on why trump has not accepted invitations from the naacp  the urban league  and the national association of black journalists because he supposedly had better things to do already on his schedule reid smiled as scott called trump  a cultural phenomenon  who draws rock star crowds  reid then zinged back that those crowds are devoid of black people reid slammed trump for pushing the false notion that every black person in america is living in poverty and going to failing schools and then asked scott about trump s history of housing discrimination  which has been cited by the justice department because the republican nominee refused to rent to black people scott claimed that it was just an accusation and denied that trump discriminated against black people  but the record shows that trump settled the case with the government because there was a strong case against him  hardly the action of a man who didn t commit such an offense reid then asked scott about trump s prominent role in the birther movement  despite multiple video tapes of trump pushing the birther conspiracy and demanding president obama s birth certificate  scott also denied that trump had anything to do with the movement  don t tell me you agree with the bitherism  sir   reid pleaded   don t tell me you agree with that  scott replied by claiming that hillary clinton started the birther movement  a notion that is totally false  and reid shut scott down for blatantly lying on her show  that s wrong  even a pastor cannot make things up on this show   she cautioned  i respect you as a pastor  but you re not going to come on and make things up  here s the video via msnbc donald trump is desperately trying to save his flailing campaign and that s the only reason why he is making feeble attempts to court black voters now  if he really cared about black people he would have been courting them from the beginning  instead  he has been palling around with white supremacists and encouraging violence against black protesters at his rallies  scott can t sit there and call himself a man of god while lying through his teeth to defend a bloated racist  it s just not going to fly featured image via screenshot
