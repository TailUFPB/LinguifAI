it s no secret that donald trump is cruel to women  look how he describes and refers to women he doesn t like  for personal or non personal reasons   he s cheated on two of his wives  resulting in some ugly and highly publicized divorces  but it s his  divorce from his first wife  ivana  that has people interested  and for good reason the divorce  first filed by ivana due to extreme cruel and inhuman treatment   is controversial and  often times  muddy  ivana trump once revealed donald trump had raped her in a violent assault when he tore off her clothes and forced himself on her  the allegation was made in a sworn deposition by trump  and was reported in the  book lost tycoon  the many lives of donald j  trump  ivana trump has since claimed that she did not mean it in  a literal or criminal sense   but the affidavit still stands but still  details of  cruel and inhuman treatment  lie buried in the sealed documents of the divorce  which is why the new york times sued last month to have them unsealed  in the state of new york  all divorce records are sealed unless determined by a judge to be useful in  special circumstances  when dealing with intense public interest of course  given the fact that donald trump is running for president of the united states  and coupled with his past statements regarding women  the public does indeed have an interest in figuring out what kind of husband donald trump was  and how he treated his first wife  or so the new york times contends but it s donald and ivana trump who are panicking and scared out of their minds at what s possibly to come marc kasowitz and other attorneys from the new york based firm kasowitz benson torres   friedman  as well as longtime trump organization lawyer michael cohen  wrote in a  brief to the judge  supreme court justice frank nervo in seeking to invade the trumps   year old confidential matrimonial files  the times and gannett  as shown in mr  trump s filing in opposition to their motion  rely on entirely unprecedented and erroneous arguments that are contrary to the protections afforded by the legislature over  years ago   the courts  have never overridden those protections because of a purported public interest in vetting political candidates  there is simply no importance  overriding or otherwise  to unsealing the matrimonial records of a political candidate well  if he s a rapist  that would be of some importance it s also worth noting that cohen  remember  an attorney   said in an interview regarding ivana s rape allegation   it is true  you cannot rape your spouse  and there s very clear case law   the marital rape exemption law in new york was struck down in   three years before ivana alleged trump assaulted her  as of   all  states have criminalized marital rape  as it s seen as form of domestic violence what s even more baffling is the trump campaign is so desperate to keep these records sealed  they made a stab at hillary clinton s medical records as precedence secretary clinton is not revealing her medical records  even though her medical condition is being raised as an issue in the current campaign  nor could or should they be compelled to do so first off  she has released them  trump as not   and second  the campaign s candidate has repeatedly slammed clinton for not doing so earlier   nor could or should they be compelled to do so  that s rich ivana trump s lawyer  ira garr  filed a brief to nervo pointing out that unsealing the records would be unfair to ivana because she isn t running for any public office  fair enough  but it s his second reason that should make people think  he thinks people are too stupid to care garr said in a brief interview tuesday that he doesn t see how the divorce court record would alter anyone s opinion of the real estate investor and gop presidential nominee because people have either factored such issues into their voting decisions or don t view those points as relevant to their decision  does anybody doubt that donald isn t that nice to women   garr asked   could you watch his interview with megyn kelly and say   he s nice to women  considering he accused megyn kelly of having her menstrual cycle during a debate  no these lawyers are just as dumb as their clients judge frank nervo has not indicated when and if he release them  but the trump lawyers  sudden legal briefs are telling that a decision could come soon featured image via spencer platt getty images
