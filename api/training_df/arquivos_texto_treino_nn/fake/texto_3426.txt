newsweek just published a damning investigative report detailing how donald trump is already fundamentally changing american foreign policy to enrich himself  even if it means being a puppet for dictators ever since russia helped him win the election  trump has refused to sever ties with his company  which builds hotels and resorts around the world but trump s business interests are putting him in the position of being controlled by other nations because every decision he makes could jeopardize his company and the profits it brings in for instance  trump is getting awfully cozy with philippines president rodrigo duterte  who is busy slaughtering thousands of his own people in a supposed effort to rid his country of drugs governments around the world have condemned the killings  so has the united nations  but because trump has a hotel that is nearing completion in the philippines  he is already sucking up to duterte  trump has even invited duterte to the white house that s right  trump is palling around with a mass murderer because he doesn t want to lose money  seriously according to newsweek the trump family has an enormous financial interest in keeping duterte happy  trump tower at century city in makati  philippines  is on the verge of completion  with potential buyers having placed deposits on at least  percent of the condominiums  according to century properties  the trump organization s business partner there in addition  trump has also been trying to build hotels and resorts in taiwan  which is probably the reason why he pissed off china by calling the taiwanese president  american presidents have recognized china as the one and only china in the world since   which is why presidents do not directly contact taiwan  by doing so  trump is signaling that he recognizes taiwan as a nation  something the chinese dispute  but once again  taiwan has leverage over trump because his business is trying to build resorts there  so trump is willing to risk war with china for the sake of profiting from taiwan  trump could also be just using the threat of doing business in taiwan in order to force beijing to allow trump to build hotels in china instead the same goes for russia  too  trump has been trying to build a hotel in moscow for decades  now he can give vladimir putin something in return for allowing construction to commence  in other words  trump may drop all sanctions against russia and ignore their aggression towards europe in exchange for a multi million dollar business deal for himself and his children turkey is currently trying to blackmail trump by holding his financial interests hostage  turkish president erdogan had a turkish executive who works with trump s business partner arrested  which is putting pressure on the cash flow trump s company receives from turkey  millions of dollars are at stake if trump doesn t bow down to erdogan s demand that the united states hand over a person the turkish government claims is a terrorist  even though they have provided no evidence to support the claim  once trump takes office  he will likely do what turkey wants in order to keep the money flowing to his pockets trump also has conflicts of interest with japan and argentina when ivanka trump sat in during her father s meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and was included in a phone call with argentine president mauricio macri  there were business deals at stake in both countries at the same time  officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with sanei international  the largest shareholder of sanei s parent company is the development bank of japan  which is wholly owned by the japanese government headed by abe and argentina recently stopped blocking a building project from moving forward after trump and his daughter spoke with macri on the phone only days after the election in short  trump is using the presidency to increase his family s fortune instead of dong what is best for our country  and this is a major threat to our democracy and our security because other nations now have the power to influence trump simply by threatening to pull the plug on building projects or cutting off profits from being sent to trump s bank account  it s a major conflict of interest that sets up a constitutional crisis the second trump takes office  and that cannot be allowed to happen if we do not want america to be trampled over by foreign governments featured image via steve pope getty images
