while it may not come as much of a surprise that the leadership at the national rifle association  nra  has a different opinion on gun control than the average american  what is surprising is that same leadership holds a different opinion than the american gun owner  according to a new poll  at least  percent of gun owners in the united states believe that the organization has changed its mission from one promoting gun safety to one dominated by professional lobbyists  they say the nra has been  overtaken by lobbyists and the interests of gun manufacturers and lost its original purpose and mission  the nra of today looks very different from what it looked like before  in fact  for most of its history  it supported  and even wrote  gun control legislation  adam winkler  author of gunfight  the battle over the right to bear arms in america  wrote   historically  the leadership of the nra was more open minded about gun control than someone familiar with the modern nra might imagine  to understand the relationship the nra has with gun control  it may help to look at who and why it was founded  after the civil war  many people in the north believed that people in the south possessed superior skills in the area of using rifles  they blamed that for the length of the war  the national slogan for the nra was   firearms safety education  marksmanship training  shooting for recreation   its main goal was to improve men s marksmanship  not ward off threats to the second amendment  the organization was founded in  that effort didn t start until the   in   the nation saw its first piece of gun control legislation signed into law  the national firearms act of  was designed to  make it difficult for any not law abiding citizen to obtain a pistol or revolver   it was authored  in part  by the nra  they also helped write the gun control act of  when these bills were written and signed into law  karl t  frederick was president of the nra  he said   i have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons  i do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns  i think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses  for about a century  the nra s motto remained the same  then the  happened  with the unrest of the assassinations and the rise of the black panthers  the mulford act was passed in california  it barred people from carrying loaded weapons around outside  while it was supported by the nra  the backlash that it spurred also galvanized a new wave of gun support  about a decade after the act was signed into law  a group of gun rights supporters took over the nra  they ousted the leadership and changed the motto to   the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed  since then  the nra has opposed many measures that have had widespread support from the american public  in poll after poll  people say they want people who buy guns to pass background checks  they want to limit the capacity of rifles and they support common sense gun control legislation  even supreme court justice anontin scalia supported limiting some of this  in his heller v  dc decision  scalia wrote   nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill  or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings  or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms  new data show more support for gun control from gun owners  while the nra leadership says one thing  the average gun owner thinks another  a few years ago  wayne lapierre  nra chief  said   the only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun   this is the response from gun owners to that new poll for its part  the nra is disputing the accuracy of the poll  jennifer baker  spokesperson for the nra said   the nra s strength is derived from our five million members and the tens of millions of second amendment supporters who vote  the majority of americans oppose gun control and they made their voices heard this past november  this was a poll paid for by a gun control group  so it s not surprising that the so called  results  further their agenda  public policy polling conducted the poll between april  and   it included  people who own guns  the margin of error is four percentage points  americans for responsible solutions commissioned the poll featured image via alex wong getty images
