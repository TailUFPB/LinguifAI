donald trump is fuming after fox new sunday host chris wallace crushed his environmental protection agency minion on the topic of climate change as we all know  trump is a climate change denier who thinks the whole thing is a scam created by the chinese so  of course  trump chose a fellow climate change denier as his epa secretary scott pruitt is an oklahoma republican who denies science  and during an interview on fox  he found himself having to defend his anti science views  apparently  he hoped the interview would be a softball affair  but chris wallace repeatedly challenged him wallace began by slamming pruitt s flawed logic that getting rid of president obama s clean power plan will somehow improve air quality  you think that rewriting and  in fact  doing away with the clean power plan is going to improve air quality  which you say is a major goal   wallace asked pruitt responded by claiming that president obama was a tyrant who ruled through executive orders instead of letting congress make the law it should be pointed out that donald trump has signed  executive orders and he hasn t even served  days yet  he is on pace to sign  executive orders in his first year alone  president obama only signed  over the course of eight years and signed less executive orders than bill clinton  george w  bush  and ronald reagan trump could very well end up signing more executive orders than any of them  so  pruitt can t seriously claim that trump is following the  rule of law   if anyone is ruling by  executive fiat   it s trump wallace then pointed out that trump s deregulation of environmental protections has ceded the moral high ground to china in the fight against pollution and climate change pruitt didn t really give a damn  he said america has nothing to apologize for  we have nothing to be apologetic about with respect to the leadership we ve show as a country   he claimed oh  but we do  fighting climate change to save out planet will take international cooperation on a unprecedented scale  by withdrawing american leadership  trump is sentencing the globe to disastrous climate change as if he thinks the united states is not part of the world and is somehow immune to what happens around us wallace proceeded to take on pruitt s belief that humans are not responsible for climate change  mr  pruitt  there are all kinds of studies that contradict you   wallace noted   the un panel on climate change says it s  percent likely that at least half of the temperature increase since the mid  century is due to human activities  mr  pruitt  are we supposed to believe that s all a coincidence  in response  pruitt contradicted his own claim that he and trump are working to improve air quality by insisting that the epa should not be able to regulate greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide wallace called pruitt out an dropped the hammer on him  sir  you re sugar coating what you have said  you said that you would not agree that carbon  is a primary contributor to global warming  and the question i have is  what if you re wrong  what if  in fact  the earth is warming  what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it  don t you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air  you don t think that plays a role  pruitt answered by claiming that america burns coal cleanly  which is not true at all  there is no such thing as  clean coal   and making such a claim is asinine here s the video via youtube according to popular mechanics coal will never be clean  it is possible to make coal emissions cleaner  in fact  we ve come a long way since the   in finding ways to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions  and more progress can be made  but the nut of the clean coal sales pitch is that we can also bottle up the  produced when coal is burned  most likely by burying it deep in the earth  that may be possible in theory  but it s devilishly difficult in practice president obama s clean power plan would have reduced carbon emissions more than they ever have been before  it was a crucial step toward fighting climate change and reducing america s role in causing it but donald trump and his minions have reversed that progress and they are making things even worse  they are gutting the environmental protection agency and have pulled america out the fight against climate change  so instead of moving forward  trump is taking america backwards and that decision will have devastating results that trump will personally experience once his mar a lago resort is under water because of sea level rise maybe when his precious golf club and resort is under water he ll admit that climate change is real  but by then  it will be too late featured image  screenshot
