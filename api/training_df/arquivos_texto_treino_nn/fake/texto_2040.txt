arizona senator john mccain seems to be the lone patriot left in the gop right now  along with perhaps south carolina senator lindsey graham  it seems mccain has had just about enough of the shady shenanigans regarding the so called  investigation  into the trump campaign s ties to russia and possible collusion  during an interview on wednesday  mccain called for a new  independent commission  saying to greta van susteren on msnbc  it s a bizarre situation  and what i think  the reason why i m calling for this select committee or a special committee  is i think that this back and forth and what the american people have found out so far that no longer does the congress have credibility to handle this alone  and i don t say that lightly  these tough remarks come as things heat up on capitol hill regarding russia  with the republican chair of the house intelligence committee  devin nunes  r ca   and the ranking democrat  adam schiff  d ca   now openly feuding over how things are being handled  this is especially true since nunes decided to brief trump   the very subject of this investigation   before briefing his own committee it s high time the rest of the republican party grew a pair and put country before party and put a stop to this nonsense  impeach trump  investigate his entire administration  and if when criminal wrongdoing is found  prosecute them watch the video below featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
