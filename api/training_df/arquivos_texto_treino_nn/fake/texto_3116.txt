as we get ready for the most bigotry fueled  racist  misogynistic administration in the modern history of the united states  the republican party is already setting its sights on robbing people of their human rights  knowing full well that president elect donald trump shares their values  or lack of   the gop has already announced their plan to defund planned parenthood  and democrats across the country are organizing to stop them perhaps the most perfect takedown of this plan we ve seen so far comes from new jersey s senator cory booker  who was a massive supporter of hillary clinton during her presidential campaign  during a press conference this week  booker absolutely tore into the gop while showing us all how to resist and stand up to such a hateful movement  here s what booker said  and it should be shared with every single pro life  or really  pro birth  republican you know  so  i don t have a message for fellow republican elected  because they re not depending on planned parenthood in their neighborhoods  they re well paid comfortable people  i have a message for every american  democrat  and republican who rely on these services or know people that do  or have the kind of heart to care enough to stand up for the women that receive these services  booker called out new jersey governor chris christie and reminded the gop that there are very real  very serious consequences for defunding such a critical organization  i saw what happened when chris christie in my state cut the funding to planned parenthood  i saw in poor neighborhoods doors being shut  hours being constricted  then  booker pointed out exactly why resisting the defunding of planned parenthood is crucial  and how he plans to help lead the fight  this is a moment in america  republicans now think they re elected with a mandate to do these kind of things  i saw just this week the craven overreach of the republican party when they tried the republican gop to gut independent ethics oversight  and what we saw there was the american people standing up and saying  we will not tolerate this   and so this is another point we see that they will listen if enough people stand up and fight and so this is the first shot in what is going to be a battle leading into real reconciliation  and if enough americans stand up and say we re not going to tolerate this  we didn t elect anybody to rip out the key preventive services to make it harder to be someone struggling in this country to get basic healthcare services  that i believe in women  that i believe fundamentally in this country and that institutions like this make a stronger  better  more intelligent  more compassionate  more loving and so frankly  what i m going to be doing   every single day now leading the group reconciliations   is trying to wake up the conscience of other folks  trying to call to people to protest  to fight  to stand up  because this cannot be allowed to happen  too many people will suffer  the consequences will be felt by all  booker s powerful words could not have come at a better time  as the gop has made targeting planned parenthood one of their first priorities  you can watch booker shut down the gop below what booker is saying gives us hope that if enough people resist and fight the republican party s hatred and self serving interests  we can protect the basic human rights of every american featured image via alex wong   getty images
