since citizens united  and even before  two names have been consistent republican stalwarts and republican donors  before donald trump  it was apparent that the republican party was owned by the koch brothers and walmart  both of whom are ardent supporters of free trade and cheap labor  now  trump and house speaker paul ryan are making enemies of both  and the republican party is in turmoil in june  before trump was even elected  republicans began their war on imports by sketching a  blueprint  for tax reform that would make imports a lot more expensive  and these days  pretty much everything you and i buy is an import trump didn t love congress  original plan  but his plan would add a  percent import tax to imports from mexico  the kochs and walmart aren t happy about that the gop confusion is mirrored by a scrambling of alliances on k streets that hasn t been seen in living memory   trump more than any president i ve seen has created a little bit of chaos within some client rosters  he s not afraid to pit people against each other   said one lobbyist who has clients that may wind up on both sides of the issue  when that happens  lobby shops will have to pick which side they re on  but as long as it s just a vague concept  that reckoning can wait   theres no legislative text  we don t have a conflict until we have a bill   he said corporate america has had plenty of intramural matches over the years  but rewriting the tax code is a dozen super bowls played all on the same day  manufacturers  including boeing  caterpillar  honeywell and pharmaceutical companies  have quickly organized to praise the border tax  retailers  including walmart  target and kohl s  are trying to kill it  they re joined by right wing megadonors charles and david koch  in december  koch industries   which imports crude and tar sands oil to be refined in the united states   said the house gop plan would  adversely impact american consumers by forcing them to pay higher prices on products   they use every single day   prices at the pump  they have warned  would skyrocket  and nothing gets a member of congress  attention faster than the flipping numbers at an exxon station source  huffington postthis puts congress in a tough spot  and as liberals  we should be grabbing the popcorn  the kochs and the waltons  walmart heirs  are huge gop donors and in return  they expect that wages will be kept low  republicans are still happy to accommodate   regulations will be kept to a minimum  again  republicans are on board  and imports will be kept cheap while this infighting is great for us and ultimately  for the country  the republican party will be hurting without their cash  which will increase our chances of regaining congress and state houses in    it does put us in a weird position  defending the kochs and walmart is pretty much against everything we stand for  but they also have their fingers on the pulse of red state america  as americans start paying a premium for their bounty paper towels and walmart crap  people will start to revolt  and thanks to the kochs and the waltons  they ll know who to revolt against featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
