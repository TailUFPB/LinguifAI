almost three years ago  a history buff and biographer of robert e  lee  jonathan horn  wrote a book that provided a different perspective of the confederate general  the book  titled the man who would not be washington  recalled a history of lee that many casual readers don t know  and one that many fans like to whitewash  with all of donald trump s ridiculous comparisons between lee and the father of our country  it s easy to overlook that the southern leader was the son of a man who d served washington in the revolutionary war like nearly no other in fact  lee s father   light horse harry   gave the eulogy at george washington s funeral first in war  first in peace  and first in the hearts of his countrymen in death  only the best things are remembered  there was no urban legend about washington s  wooden teeth  while he was alive  he provided for the liberation of his own slaves in his will  his last words  after the valiant efforts of doctors to save him  were  tis well   washington was a complex man  and his legacy would only unpack years after his passing the same can be said of the eulogist s son  when the most famous confederate looked at secession before the civil war  he was disdainful the framers of our constitution never exhausted so much labour  wisdom and forbearance in its formation   if it was intended to be broken by every member of the confederacy at will lee eventually resigned his commission in the union army  he joined his home state of virginia in taking up arms in rebellion  and like many of the conservatives of today  he fudged on his history  insisting that he d always favored leaving the united states  but his complexity  unpacked after his death  is most compelling in looking at his view of remembrance robert e  lee never wanted monuments or memorials to the civil war some of the history of lee s re change of heart is well known  upon his surrender  he vowed to support the u s  constitution  henceforth   and commanded his followers to do the same  but many wanted to honor lee s service to the south with statues and memorials  lee rebuffed them as regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated  my conviction is  that  however grateful it would be to the feelings of the south  the attempt  in the present condition of the country  would have the effect of retarding instead of accelerating its accomplishment  and of continuing if not adding to the difficulties under which the southern people labor robert e  lee understood then what many still do not get today  that the flags of wars past serve nothing but to fight those wars over again in our minds  he was adamant i think it wiser moreover not to keep open the sores of war  but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavoured to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered now  i personally am not a historian  but early america has always been a passion of mine   my great great great great great grandfather is buried in calais  vermont  his service in the revolutionary war inscribed on his headstone  it should likewise at least serve as instruction for those who would fawn over its legends  many symbols exist today commemorating the confederacy  especially in virginia  lee s own state but if you want to honor robert e  lee  honor the fact that he never wanted to see you waving a confederate flag featured image via win mcnamee getty images
