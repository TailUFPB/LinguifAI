president elect donald trump loves bragging about two things  things he doesn t deserve and things that aren t true  he kills two birds with one stone when he boasts about his  landslide  win  which is technically a loss when you consider that hillary clinton beat him by millions of votes despite how much trump feels he deserves the presidency  many americans disagree   and we re seeing direct proof of this resistance as trump is finding it impossible to get people to perform at his inauguration in january  with only a few weeks to go and no a list entertainers up for the task  trump had hoped he could turn to his longtime pal  opera singer andrea bocelli  it was reported  trump has a long standing relationship with bocelli  and wants to ask him in person to perform  the plan is to have acts at the inauguration that are meaningful for trump  and he s a huge fan of bocelli  but unfortunately for trump  this too is falling apart  despite being friends with trump for years  bocelli has chosen to bail on him due to the intense backlash the singer faced on social media  some threatened to  boycott bocelli   while other fans warned him  you will lose millions of fans   according to another close source  bocelli said there was no way he d take the gig       he was  getting too much heat  and he said no  as time runs out  so are trump s options  he s already faced multiple rejections from artists such as john legend  adam lambert  and elton john  trump became so desperate that he started to offer u s  ambassadorships to talent agents if they could find him someone to perform  but that hasn t worked either but trump still has one more option  considering that trump ditched a critical press conference to have a meeting with artist kanye west last week  perhaps trump might consider asking him  it would only make sense to have an artist just as egotistical and narcissistic as trump perform at his inauguration featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
