donald trump s admiration of vladimir putin and the tyrannical way he runs russia is very worrying to trump s friend joe scarborough the morning joe host strongly advised that trump to put out a statement condemning the killing of journalists and political opponents  because if he doesn t  his recent statements in two separate interviews over the course of the last year are even scarier  he s running his country  and at least he s a leader   trump said in december  when asked about putin murdering journalists and political rivals   unlike what we have in this country  but again  he kills journalists that don t agree with him   scarborough replied trump then stunned scarborough by excusing putin s crimes  i think our country does plenty of killing  also  joe  so  you know  there s a lot of stupidity going on in the world right now  joe  a lot of killing going on  a lot of stupidity  and that s the way it is  and just as in that interview  trump basically repeated himself during an interview with bill o reilly that aired prior to the super bowl on sunday  there are a lot of killers   trump said in defense of putin   you think our country s so innocent  and that makes joe scarborough wonder if trump will start emulating putin  if donald trump keeps being asked to criticize vladimir putin for assassinating journalists  and donald trump refuses to criticize vladimir putin for assassinating journalists  and say  well  we do it  too  in a sense  does that suggest that he thinks that it s ok to assassinate journalists  does that suggest that it s ok to jail political opponents  to assassinate political opponents  scarborough then condemned trump for defending putin and advised him to issue a statement against killing journalists and political rivals to make it clear that he does not support doing these things  if you don t condemn after being asked repeatedly to condemn these actions  at some point you go back to the  he who does not deny admits  story  and it suggests that he does  i suggest somebody at the white house get him to write a very strong statement letting the world know that he condemns the assassination of journalists and political rivals  because he suggests in the two interviews with o reilly and us that he does not how do you compare a country whose leader assassinates journalists  a country s leader who assassinates political rivals   we saw one found dead in the street across from the kremlin a year ago   who jails economic rivals  who has an authoritarian regime that has put everybody on notice  he s plundered his country  many people estimate that putin is worth   billion that he has stolen from the russian people  and yet this desire to keep preaching moral equivalency continues and it is baffling  it was disturbing enough a year ago  it is baffling now  as president of the united states  that he s still doing this  here s the video via msnbc donald trump is a threat to our individual liberties and our lives  his obsession with wanting to be buddies with putin is frightening and the fact that he is actually defending murder is sickening and un american featured image via screenshot
