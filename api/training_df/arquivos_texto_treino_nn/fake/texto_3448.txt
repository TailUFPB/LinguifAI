if you ve ever wondered if donald trump is completely unqualified to make any decisions about anything involving the good of our nation  ever  look no further than incoming deputy secretary of state john bolton  who fills in the  crazed conspiracy theorist  box on your apocalypse bingo cards  if you re playing   on sunday  bolton appeared on fox news to let the world know to ignore the cia s evidence that russia actively worked to install the donald in the oval office because it s all big gubmint propaganda or something  a  false flag operation   to be exact yes  this is a term that we have heard applied to the sandy hook shooting and pretty much anything that places conservatives in the uncomfortable position of having to self analyze their horrific positions on guns  race  gender  and other topics  the phrase was largely made popular by trump ally alex jones and deceased right wing propagandist andrew breitbart  yeah  the guy conservatives think obama had killed for knowing too much  they ve even combined this conspiracy theory with the one about hillary clinton having child sex slaves in some circles  but i digress  and usually virtually assures that the person who uttered the term is a f cking idiot which  of course  brings us to bolton  it s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the dnc and the rnc computers was not a false flag operation  are words actually uttered by someone trump just placed in a very important position  talking points memo provided a pretty handy transcript of what went down bolton  it s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the dnc and the rnc computers was not a false flag operation  let s remember what fbi director james comey said dealing with hillary s home brew server  he said we found no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration  but given the nature of this  we didn t expect to  meaning  a really sophisticated foreign intelligence service would not leave any cyber fingerprints  and yet people say they did leave cyber fingerprints in the hacks regarding our election  so the question that has to be asked is why did the russians run their smart intelligence service against hillary s server but their dumb intelligence services against the election  shawn  when you say false flag  that s a very serious charge  false flag by whom  here is  the washington post   the post reported the cia has concluded individuals with close ties to the russian government hacked the e mails  intelligence officials have determined that russia s goal was to help trump win rather than simply undermine confidence in the election  are you actually accusing someone here in this administration of trying   in the intelligence community of trying to throw something bolton  we just don t know  but i believe that intelligence has been politicized in the obama administration to a very significant degree shawn  would the intelligence officials politicize this to go so far that could damage our republic and what we have for  plus years stood for bolton  i think the whole thing is called into question and an independent investigation becomes extremely important  i think it s critical to answer the question i posed  if you think the russians did this  then why did they leave fingerprints shawn  maybe because we have such sophisticated and  bolton  james comey and the fbi couldn t find any fingerprints  shawn  they use a different standard  it s been shown they have a criminal start by the cia has more of an intellectual  bolton  let s hear the debate shawn  what do you want to hear  something from the cia director bolton  i d like to know  i think we have something now  we don t want to compromise intelligence sources and methods but when you make that kind of allegation  if it were true  and the russians have the capability and the intention of doing it  i m not by any means trying to exonerate them  but if you say they ve done that  let me be clear  either in the cyber world or elsewhere  we should retaliate  it is unacceptable for the american constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way  so it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this  and i don t think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are shawn  the president has ordered a review  senator mccain and others of the armed services committee are having hearings on this with the new congress  let me read you a statement from both senators mccain  senatorsgraham  schumer  and jack reed of rhode island  both bipartisan  for years foreign adversaries have directed cyber attacks at america s physical  economic  and military infrastructure while stealing our intellectual property  now our institutions have been targeted  recent reports of russian interference in our election should alarm every american  this cannot become a partisan issue  the stakes are too high for our country  mccain this morning called putin a thug  a killer  and a murderer  the president has ordered a public review  what are you calling on the president to do before january   to reveal the classified information  to bring it all out so americans can know if russia had a hand in this election bolton  one thing that makes me very nervous is barack obama saying let s have this report before the  of january so i can wrap it up  i think the burden for well or ill is going to fall on mike pompeo who has been named as president elect trump s cia director  i think he s trusted by republicans and democrats  he doesn t bring any baggage  he s a new official at the cia  i d look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence committee  i just think these are such serious charges  again  if the russians or any other foreign government think that they can undermine the integrity of our elections or defeat our constitutional process  this is just as serious an attack as a military attack shawn  for those who are bothered by your claim of a potential false flag  that s very disturbing as an american bolton  we would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the russians  that s why i say until we know more about how the insurance   intelligence community came to this conclusion  while he didn t say definitively that he believed this to be a  false flag   bolton made it clear that he might or might not believe that president obama   whose administration has a history of politicizing intelligence  to a very significant degree   wink  wink   might or might not have told the cia to falsely claim that russia helped donald trump get elected
