as crunch time nears and states are having their primary contests  the clinton campaign is wasting no time in getting further ahead than the republicans in a new report detailed by politico  hillary clinton and her campaign are setting course to raise over   billion to unseat vulnerable house and senate republicans  with the aim of knocking off  to  house seats from republicans and taking back the senate hillary clinton will raise   billion for democrats and the party will train some of their efforts   and that money   on defeating house and senate republicans  party leaders privately concede that the senate could be lost either way  but senior house republicans say they re in good shape across the country  and see no evidence that the control of the chamber is in playrepublicans are especially antsy at these revelations  considering the republican national committee fell almost   million short in their july fundraising predications  they only conjured up   million   in that same month  the democratic congressional campaign committee  the fundraising arm of the democratic national committee  raised over   million  not including the total   million in joint fundraising with clinton   and has raised almost   million more than the rnc for the  fiscal year so far in contrast  trump had a very good month for fundraising  counter that with the rnc s pathetic monthly numbers  the money speaks for itself  the gop is putting its trust  and money  in trump and trump alone so while trump is hurting down ballot candidates and their efforts for re election  clinton is set to raise unprecedented amounts of money for the democrats  all while having her own campaign to fund back in may   politico reported that clinton s campaign sought to raise over   billion by the time the november general election rolled around  considering the clinton campaign has raised  per opensecrets    million for her own personal campaign    million in  for down ballot candidates in   and over   million through the summer of   coupled with the goal of   billion by november   that leaves the campaign roughly   million off target still  the clinton machine is dominating republicans in fundraising  not just for the presidential candidate  but for everyone else involved clinton is serious about getting stuff done   she knows her policies will be  pie in the sky  without support from congress  so what does she do  she raises more money for other democrats than she does for herself  trump  on the other hand  hoards the money for himself while he s a billionaire  see how that concentration of wealth screws everyone over  republicans  ironic  isn t it featured image justin sullivan getty images
