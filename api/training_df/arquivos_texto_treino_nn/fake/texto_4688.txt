miracle mattress of san antonio wants everyone to know that they ll never forget sept      to that end  they posted the most amazingly  disgustingly tone deaf and just plain terrible commercial to commemorate the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on u s  soil  it was cheerful  it talked about the twin towers and used them to promote discounts on all their mattresses  and then and then they took it too far  way too far  so impossibly far that we can t even see it from the boundaries of decency with the hubble space telescope because using a national tragedy to promote a sale isn t classless enough watch it for yourself  trigger warning  it was posted to a parody page aimed at shaming miracle mattress up one side and down the other for this  and remains viewable there  it has been removed from social media elsewhere miracle mattress has been shredded to confetti for this  to the point where they ve posted a letter of apology on their main facebook page  and changed their background image to show part of that letter  that s not enough for some of the people on their page  though  many of the comments below are from members of the military  people who were in nyc on that horrific day  and even some of the responders they re rightfully angry and their comments are heart wrenching  for them  and for anybody with the tiniest micron of a heart  the apology rings hollow and false and just plain isn t enough          miracle mattress  last post on facebook is a screenshot of a second letter from the owner  mike bonnano  the company has closed the doors of their store indefinitely  will remain silent through the   anniversary  and then will issue a formal statement next week that will be of major comfort to the people who are pissed off  offended  and hurt by that video  we re sure  this will definitely cost the company business  it might push them out of business  and for a company that s so clueless that the owner didn t know his own daughter made that video  perhaps that s for the best featured image via screen capture from embedded video
