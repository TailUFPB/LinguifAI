donald trump s number two man  mike pence  has largely been seen as the antithesis to trump s erratic  bombastic  authoritarian style of governing  however  pence is crazy in his own way  he s a theocrat who wants to usher in mandatory evangelical christianity and force it upon all americans  what s really scary is that he is so quiet about it that most people don t know what kind of monster pence really is until they do a bit of research and discover his horrifying beliefs  well  all that may be changing  and we might have the associated press to thank for it by now  everyone knows that it turns out that while he was governor of indiana  pence used a private aol email address to conduct sensitive government business   and the email was actually hacked  this is amazingly hypocritical  considering the fact that republicans everywhere   including trump and pence  of course   hammered hillary clinton relentlessly  and even had their crowds screaming  lock her up     all for doing the exact same thing that pence has just been caught doing  the hypocrisy here defies description the plot of the whole thing thickens  because it appears that the ap repeatedly asked for transcripts of pence s secret emails that were not released to the public  as a result  in the story of pence s email scandal  pence s wife  karen pence  had her private email address published  this  of course  has pence beside himself with rage  he is now trying to bully the ap into an apology  trump style mark paoletta  pence s white house counsel  sent the following directive to the ap  the publication of mrs  pence s active private email address to millions of your readers has subjected her to vitriolic and malicious emails and raised serious security concerns  there was absolutely no reason to publish this private email address and you should be ashamed of your reprehensible contact  your organization should apologize to mrs  pence for violating her privacy  and the associated press should observe the basic tenets of fairness  decency and journalistic integrity and covering the vice president  mrs  pence and their family in the future  here is pence s belligerent tweet  with the entire letter included when we requested they take it down  they refused  the  ap owes my wife an apology  pic twitter com ldmmnewnwf  vice president pence   vp  march    is really rich  considering that trump tweeted out senator lindsey graham  r sc  s personal cell phone number during the campaign  all because graham dared to criticize trump  pence really has no moral high ground regarding anything resembling decency  considering that he is in bed with the donald  especially on these sorts of matters as for the ap  they are being good  tough checks on these bullies  and have refused to remove karen pence s email address from the original  as a consolation  though  they did omit the address from further writings on the subject of the pence email situation  according to spokeswoman laura easton  who says   ap removed the email address from subsequent stories after learning mrs  pence still used the account  this is all pence s fault  anyway  because according to the ap  the story only ran because pence  repeatedly stonewalled media requests to view public records when he was indiana s governor  including emails about state business distributed from a private aol account that was hacked last year  this is really getting ridiculous  these threats to the press every time a story this incompetent  chaotic administration doesn t like drops  they are corrupt  vindictive  malicious  and likely engaged in criminal activity keep the pressure on  journalists  they re cracking featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
