hurricane maria is the worst natural disaster to befall the island of puerto rico in nearly a hundred years  homes are destroyed  families displaced  and an already suffering infrastructure has been wiped out  nearly the entire island is without power and more than   million citizens have no access to clean water  even to drink  and while the people of puerto rico are desperate for help and they are dying  donald trump has been golfing that sounds horrible  and it is  it is fucking horrible it s not new  it s not surprising  and it seems at this point to almost be intentional  there are some who believe his inattention is intentional  and it s pretty hard to disagree besides the fact that trump was nearly a week late in even addressing the horror in puerto rico  he couldn t seem to stay focused while there were any football games on television   he can t stop tweeting about players sitting or kneeling during the national anthem  and now that he has turned his attention in at least a nominal way to the people of puerto rico  he is furious that anyone would be criticizing his response to the disaster how can people help but criticize  when the hurricane made landfall  trump promised all the federal resources the island could want  and understandably  that made people expect him to do that  but then he and his inner circle were invisible for four straight days  including   you guessed it   going on a golf weekend in new jersey  he didn t take a single meeting about puerto rico while he was in bedminster that weekend  instead dedicating  percent of his non golf time to nfl tweets now trump has a club in his hand again  it s not like he doesn t know how insensitive and irresponsible it looks to go golfing while there s an emergency happening  it s been scarcely more than a year since he criticized barack obama for doing just that president obama should have gone to louisiana days ago  instead of golfing  too little  too late   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    mayor of puerto rico s capital city  san juan  has been on television literally begging for help  the average human can survive for three days without drinking water  it took four days for him to even stop tweeting about football players they are dying  and it could have been stopped featured image via drew angerer getty images
