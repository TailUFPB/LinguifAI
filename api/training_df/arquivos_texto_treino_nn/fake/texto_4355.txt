one of the most insane things about republican nominee donald trump is that even when he massively f cks up  he can t help but brag about how  smart  and  brilliant  he is  this has been especially true when it comes to his shady tax returns  which he still refuses to release to the american people despite several promises to be transparent if you watched the first presidential debate between trump and hillary clinton last week  you saw trump shamelessly boast about how  smart  he was for not paying federal income taxes  and after recent reports discovered that the business mogul hasn t paid taxes in almost two decades  trump claimed to have  brilliant   superior knowledge of america s tax codes  which allows him to manipulate the system to his advantage  well  the truth is coming out now that an ex accountant of trump has come forward jack mitnick  one of trump s former accountants  has given an interview with inside edition that exposes another one of trump s many lies  mitnick was the accountant cited in the  tax returns that were recently leaked  where trump was shown to have lost a staggering one billion dollars in a year  according to mitnick  trump doesn t even know anything about taxes  even though he claims to  mitnick said  i did all the tax preparation  he never saw the product until it was presented to him for signature  i m the one who did all the work  this sounds exactly like typical trump   taking full credit for the hard work of other people  the only thing trump did that was perhaps  smart  was to hire a savvy accountant   and yet he continues to try and convince america that his knowledge of how the tax system works makes him the better presidential candidate  it s seriously pathetic you can watch mitnick s interview below  in which he exposes trump as a lying fraud featured image via spencer platt   getty images
