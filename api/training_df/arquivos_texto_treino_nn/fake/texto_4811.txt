madonna just called out donald trump s privileged sons and it s epic the republican nominee s sons eric and donald jr  often go hunting for sport because that s what rich white assholes do with their spare time in   the douchy duo went on a safari and killed a majestic leopard that they held up like a trophy while getting their picture taken  they then posted the image on the internet to brag about their kill because apparently they think killing an animal that is decreasing in overall population somehow makes them men well  madonna has seen the picture and she is not impressed and she really only had one word to describe trump s little boys  how big of  pussy do you have to be to kill this noble animal for sport   madonna wrote on instagram along with the photo   just ask donald trump jr and his brother eric  then she endorsed hillary clinton because she doesn t need to shoot animals to prove how tough she is how big of  pussy do you have to be to kill this noble animal for sport  just ask donald trump jr and his brother eric  one more reason to vote for hilary     a photo posted by madonna   madonna  on aug    at   pdtas mentioned above  the leopard population is decreasing and the species has been designated as  vulnerable  by the world conservation union  so the trump s hunt is definitely something worth being enraged about  after all  we are witnessing a decline of many of the world s animal species and these two assholes are contributing to the problem in addition  the brothers have killed elephants  which is an endangered species facing a catastrophic decline  and that s just the tip of the iceberg since there are photos of many other animals they have killed  law enforcement might want to make sure two aren t serial killers  because killing animals is how that usually starts  instead of spending their daddy s money on killing sprees  perhaps they should spend the money on making sure these animals are here for future generations to enjoy  but that would be asking a lot of these heartless pricks featured image via the mirror
