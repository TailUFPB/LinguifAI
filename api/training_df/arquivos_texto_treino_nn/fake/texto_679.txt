donald trump has successfully torn the republican party  and america  apart  his policies have not only divided americans across the country  but even members of his own party are at odds with their president s policies one thing that is shattering the gop is the growing opposition to trump s immigration agenda  during trump s campaign and budding presidency  trump was touting a border wall and mass deportations  now that trump has announced somewhat more concrete plans  some high profile republicans are publicly voicing their disappointment one of the most outspoken gopers going up against trump is south carolina senator lindsey graham  who is warning trump that his merit based immigration plan would be a  disaster  for states like south carolina  graham said in a statement  after dealing with this issue for more than a decade  i know that when you restrict legal labor to employers it incentivizes cheating  here s trump announcing his merit based system  called the raise act i campaigned on creating a merit based immigration system that protects u s  workers   taxpayers  watch  https   t co   raiseact pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    trump announced the raise act on tuesday  it has been opposed by several democratic lawmakers and several republicans like graham  these lawmakers are arguing that trump s proposed plan puts the service industry  in peril   graham explained  south carolina s number one industry is agriculture and tourism is number two  if this proposal were to become law  it would be devastating to our state s economy which relies on this immigrant workforce  south carolina s agriculture and tourism industry advertise for american workers and want to fill open positions with american workers  unfortunately  many of these advertised positions go unfilled  hotels  restaurants  golf courses and farmers will tell you this proposal to cut legal immigration in half would put their business in peril  another south carolina republican  tim scott  also opposed trump s plans  scott stated that america needed to fix  our broken illegal immigration problem  but also wanted the country  to encourage the legal process  due to its positive effects on the labor force  senate republican conference chairman john thune had similar concerns about the labor workforce  he said  if we get on immigration  there will be a lot of different perspectives on that  we have workforce needs  and some of those are filled by the immigrant labor supply  unfortunately  this is likely going to fall on deaf ears  considering that the current potus was ignorant enough to say in his campaign announcement  when mexico sends its people  they aren t sending their best   trump has been anti immigration from the start  and he clearly doesn t care if the way he goes about it sucks featured image is a screenshot
