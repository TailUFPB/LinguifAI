house republicans had seven years to come up with a plan superior to the affordable care act and their plan is so bad that not even the gop majority could pass it after uselessly voting to repeal the affordable care act over sixty times during those years in order to please their conservative base  republicans appear to be chickening out from actually doing it because once the dubiously named american healthcare act passes  it would strip health care from over  million americans  many of whom are republican voters for some reason the bill would also cause the price of healthcare to skyrocket  especially for senior citizens who would have to pay ten times as much as they do right now under the affordable care act anyway  the vote on the republican bill was scheduled for thursday  but once republican leadership realized that they could muster enough members of their own party to get the necessary number of votes  they canceled the vote seriously  republicans control the house and they couldn t even bring up their own bill for an up or down vote  simply put  it was a humiliating failure of epic proportions once donald trump found the egg on his face  he immediately demanded that house republicans vote on friday  and so we now wait for the moment when trump suffers a major policy defeat because republicans discovered that repealing the affordable care act isn t such a great idea after all adding to the humiliation on thursday was cnn anchor jake tapper  who pointed out how long republicans have been having their collective wet dream about repealing the signature achievement of america s first black president  and then mocked them for failing to do so  it turns out it s a lot easier for republican leaders to say  repeal and replace  than to do it   tapper said  seven years ago today  the affordable care act or obamacare was signed into law by president obama and since that time republicans have been planning  hoping  dreaming for this day  the moment where they could finally repeal obamacare and replace it with their own solution to the nation s health care mess  they have had seven years to prepare for this day now weeks after optimistic talk from house leaders  declarations from white house secretary sean spicer that  the bill will pass the house tonight and there is no plan b   well  the bill was in such peril republican leaders pulled it and postponed the vote  and what critics are calling an  embarrassing and ignominious move   so humiliating  it signifies the only thing worse would have been to actually bring it to a vote where republican leaders were apparently confident it would die  here s the video via youtube if this bill fails to pass it will be a humiliating defeat for trump and republicans  but it will be a glorious victory for the american people and the millions who rely on the affordable care act to help get and keep accessible and affordable health insurance so as friday approaches  americans need to urge their republican representatives to vote against the bill  because if trump is able to bully the holdouts into voting for it  he can bully them into voting for anything and then america is truly screwed featured image via cagle
