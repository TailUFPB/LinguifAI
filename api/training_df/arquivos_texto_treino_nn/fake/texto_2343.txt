when people go to the voting booth  they expect certain values to be represented when they pull the lever for someone with a  d  next to his or her name  if a candidate for office says  s he is a democrat  we expect that person to be pro choice and in favor of equal rights for women  pro lgbtq rights  pro criminal justice reform  in favor of raising taxes on the rich  in favor of unions and workers  rights  and in favor of comprehensive immigration reform  among other things  however  this is not always how things shake out  case in point  west virginia  democrat  joe manchin manchin voted in favor of racist jeff sessions for attorney general  bucking democratic values of the defense of equal rights for all  he has also been staunchly against equal marriage rights for same sex couples  that is just for starters  too  manchin has consistently voted with republicans in the senate more than he has voted with those of his own party  and at donald trump s first address to a joint session of congress  he could be seen cozying up to the bigoted president  and hopping to his feet with a standing ovation during the speech at every chance  at the end of it  he eagerly went to shake hands and kiss trump s ass  rather than standing in solidarity with  resistance   minded democrats liberal pundits and bloggers are not the only ones noticing joe manchin s bizarre  republican like behavior  either  right wingers believe he is just doing this stuff in order to make sure that his deep red state re elects him in   west virginia gop chair conrad lucas says of what manchin is doing  it is obvious that west virginia was the most pro trump state and joe manchin was a steadfast supporter of hillary clinton since day one of the  campaign and he is up for re election in   so he is going to do everything he can to mask his past  but i think voters in west virginia are much smarter than falling for joe manchin  however  liberals have a different   and likely more accurate   theory of manchin s true leanings  progressive change campaign co chair adam green committee says  senate democrats running for re election in red states will lose their general elections if they don t inspire independent voters and the democratic base  to win in   he needs to be more in touch with the times and stand up more strongly to trump and his team of billionaires and bankers  adam green is correct  someone needs to primary manchin and defeat him  he is doing the bidding of republicans and donald trump in the senate under the guise of being a democrat  he isn t   he s just a dino  a wolf in sheep s clothing  i wouldn t be surprised if it turned out he voted for trump once he was in the privacy of the voting booth look at candidates  not just party  folks  if you find rethugs hiding behind a  d  get rid of them featured image via mark wilson getty images
