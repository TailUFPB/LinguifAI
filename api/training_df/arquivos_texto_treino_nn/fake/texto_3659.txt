donald trump just accused millions of americans of voter fraud  proving once again that he should be denied the presidency over the course of the last  hours  trump has been whining about a recount effort in wisconsin and attempts to trigger recounts in michigan and pennsylvania  if the recount goes against him  hillary clinton would become the president elect and trump would be forced to go home and cry into a gold lined pillow about how big of a loser he is in addition to those twitter posts about recounts  trump just posted three more bragging that he won the popular vote even though the current vote count shows hillary with more than a  million vote lead trump claims he won the popular vote because  million people voted illegally  which is a wild accusation that has zero evidence supporting it in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    then claimed that he would have won the popular vote had he focused more on a few large states rather than smaller ones it would have been much easier for me to win the so called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in  or   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    instead of the  states that i visited  i would have won even more easily and convincingly  but smaller states are forgotten    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    the fact remains that trump lost the popular vote by a wide margin and his electoral margin could be flipped if recounts go the way many hope regardless  donald trump just disqualified himself from the presidency again by attacking the democratic process  recounts are legal and hillary clinton has every right to ask for one  especially since trump margin of victory in wisconsin  michigan  and pennsylvania are so narrow  they re part of the democratic process furthermore  trump just insulted  million americans by claiming that their votes don t count  he has absolutely no proof that  million people voted illegally  and such a wild accusation proves that he is unfit to lead this country enough is enough  donald trump is a disgrace and he should be forced to step aside  he does not deserve the the title of president elect and he certainly does not deserve to be called president  period featured image  alex wong getty images
