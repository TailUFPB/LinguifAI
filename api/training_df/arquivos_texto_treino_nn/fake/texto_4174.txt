president obama should put the national guard and other military units on standby on election day because if trump supporters don t get the results they want  they are going to try to kill hillary clinton and anyone else standing in the way of their party taking over the government the boston globe attended a donald trump rally in ohio last week and talked to several suppporters of the republican nominee about what they will do if their candidate loses to them  however  the only way trump can lose is if their is election fraud  which trump has already accused hillary clinton of committing in pennsylvania in august  trump declared that the only way he can lose is if hillary clinton cheats  thus setting the stage for massive complaints of election fraud if hillary wins the election on november   even by a landslide trump has made his crowd of middle aged white supporters very angry and very paranoid scott webb is taking his command from trump to watch polling places very seriously  trump said to watch your precincts   the  year old said   i m going to go  for sure  i ll look for well  it s called racial profiling  mexicans  syrians  people who can t speak american  i m going to go right up behind them  i ll do everything legally  i want to see if they are accountable  i m not going to do anything illegal  i m going to make them a little bit nervous  in other words  webb is going to try to intimidate anyone who doesn t have the same skin color as he does because trump supporters believe that only minorities commit voter fraud  year old jeannine bell smith is already predicting unprecedented amounts of voter fraud this election even though it is very rare in this country  we re going to have a lot of election fraud   she said   they are having illegals vote  in some states  you don t need voter registration to vote  we can t have that lying bitch in the white house  judy wright doesn t care if hillary wins in a squeaker or by a landslide   if hillary wins  it s rigged   she said   all i know is our country is not going to be a country anymore  i ve heard people talk about a revolution  i ve heard people talk about separation of states  i don t even like to think about it  but i don t think this movement is going away  we don t have a voice anymore  and donald trump is giving us a voice  indeed  many trump supporters are ready to overthrow the government and assassinate hillary clinton if trump doesn t win  that s what  year old dan bowman told the boston globe in the scariest quote they obtained  if she s in office  i hope we can start a coup  she should be in prison or shot  that s how i feel about it  we re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes  there s going to be a lot of bloodshed  but that s what it s going to take i would do whatever i can for my country  donald trump and his supporter are the most dangerous threat against america and our democracy  trump has already called for  second amendment people  to do something about hillary clinton if she wins and nominates supreme court justices that conservatives don t approve of  he has also called for her to be imprisoned and his fanatical supporters are starting to foam at the mouth at the thought to attempting to violently overthrow the government even kentucky governor matt bevin has called for a bloody revolt if trump doesn t win trump supporters claim they are oppressed  but that s just because they aren t allowed to oppress black people  gays  and muslims  they literally think they are being oppressed because they can t legally oppress others the fact is that if any trump supporters who attempt a coup will be guilty of treason and should pay major consequences for their actions  that being said  the federal government and law enforcement need to take these threats seriously  we cannot not tolerate such an attack on our democracy and the peaceful transition of power that has existed in this country since its founding  so no matter how many votes trump loses by  even if it comes down to a few thousand  trump s supporters need to accept that they lost fair and square featured image  screenshot
