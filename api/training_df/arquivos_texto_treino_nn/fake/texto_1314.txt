as if donald trump didn t piss off world leaders enough during his awful overseas trip  he s once again threatening to unravel america s relationship with other countries by reconsidering the paris climate deal  but it turns out  trump might really be screwed if he does this earlier today  it was announced that trump would probably be scrapping the plan  after word of this horrible news got out  tesla ceo elon musk decided to act quickly and sent a strong message to trump on twitter   and as a member of trump s council of business advisers  this is going to be something the disgraceful potus does not want to hear  on twitter  musk announced that he will bail on trump s council if the president abandons the paris climate change deal  musk assured his followers that he would do everything in his power to make trump rethink this  he wrote  don t know which way paris will go  but i ve done all i can to advise directly to potus  through others in wh   via councils  that we remain  when one of his followers wondered how musk would react if trump didn t take his advice  musk sent a direct threat to trump  will have no choice but to depart councils in that case  while the tesla ceo has gotten a lot of backlash for his role in trump s advisory council in the first place  it is somewhat comforting that he s using his presence for good in this case  musk has previously stated that he had joined trump s council because  advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that i agree with actions by the administration   however  with musk s latest message to trump  there clearly seems to be a point in which he is willing to draw the line  let s hope trump listens featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
