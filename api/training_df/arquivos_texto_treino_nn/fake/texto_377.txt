no one likes to be touched by donald trump   not even his own fellow republicans on thursday  the full extent of trump s repulsiveness was on display when he spoke with florida senator marco rubio  who was also one of his competitors in the  primaries trump was visiting florida on a tour of the damage left by hurricane irma  when he took a moment to commend rubio  who clearly wasn t having it  perhaps he remembered how disgusting trump s behavior was while he was running against him in the primaries  so the look on rubio s face said it all  when trump approached and touched his shoulder  rubio couldn t hold back a grimace and nearly shuddered on camera  you can watch this horrible  cringe worthy moment below watch  while standing next to marco rubio  trump says he hopes rick scott runs for senate https   t co   nbc politics   nbcpolitics  september    was encouraging florida gov  rick scott  r  to run for the senate seat that is now being occupied by democratic senator bill nelson  trump said to the cameras  what do i know  but i hope this man right here  rick scott  runs for the senate  it s unclear if rubio was wincing because he isn t happy with trump s choice   after all  scott previously suggested that his millionaire buddy carlos beruff should take rubio s seat   or because he really doesn t like trump touching him rubio would be far from the only person who doesn t want trump getting that close to him  recently  reporter katy tur detailed a truly disturbing encounter she had with trump  which resulted in the potus planting an unwanted kiss on her cheek  it has also been widely documented that first lady melania trump winces or looks extremely uncomfortable whenever trump touches her  it s clear that there s definitely something wrong with trump s transfer of affection  and it seems to make everyone feel dirty featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
