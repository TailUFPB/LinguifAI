if rudy giuliani is going to continue bringing up    he should at least have the common decency to not lie about what happened that day and in the aftermath after all  thousands of pictures were taken that day and in the days after in addition to hundreds of videos  so one would think giuliani would know better than to blatantly lie but that s exactly what he did during a rally in florida on wednesday in support of serial groper donald trump  don t tell me if you said that you remember september      giuliani said in reference to hillary talking about being in the city   i remember september     yes  yes  you helped to get benefits for the people who were injured that day  but i heard her say that she was there that day  i was there that day  i don t remember seeing hillary clinton there  that was like when she said she had to run through gunfire  that turned out to be  what do we call it  a lie  but don t tell me that you subscribe to the notion that all of us who were there on september   and we re lucky to have been alive and lost so many friends  i lost so many friends on september   i think about it every day  don t tell me you belong to our very  very tight group of  never forget   don t tell me that  here s the video via twitter rudy giuliani   i was there  on     i don t remember seeing hillary clinton there   https   t co   abc news politics   abcpolitics  october    clinton was serving her first year as a united states senator representing new york at the time the planes hit the twin towers on    she was in washington d c  heading to the senate when evacuations were underway the next day  hillary went to new york city to stand in solidarity with giuliani and governor george pataki  both republicans  and tour the devastation as for giuliani never seeing hillary  a single photo makes everything pretty damn clear as my colleague oliver willis pointed out on twitter  i don t remember seeing hillary clinton  on     rudy giuliani  just now  look to your left  rudy  pic twitter com zjbvfmdhuf  oliver willis   owillis  october    look to the left   indeed it s completely unfair for republicans to pretend that they were the only ones who went through    the fact is that the entire country went through it  even if they were not physically there  besides  hillary was in our nation s capital that day when terrorists flew a plane into the pentagon but  hey  at least giuliani s memory is improving  only a few weeks ago he forgot that   ever happened featured image  jeff swensen getty images
