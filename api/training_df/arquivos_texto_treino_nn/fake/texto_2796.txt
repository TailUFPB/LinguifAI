after this past week and few days that trump has been our president   we as americans have no choice but to be fully aware of the horrors that are in store for us  already  he has signed executive orders authorizing a partial muslim ban that led to nationwide protests before it was ultimately shut down  temporarily  by a federal judge  removing funding from any international health organizations that so much as mention abortion  two major pipelines that will destroy our environment  his stupid fucking wall  and even concentration camps for the millions of undocumented immigrants he intends to round up already  the first president in history that was effectively installed by a hostile foreign dictator through an aggressive propaganda and fake news campaign as well as a series of hacks directly authorized and overseen by russian president vladimir putin  is not only proving the naysayers correct  but showing the world that they have underestimated the level of horribleness he can attain  as always  alec baldwin rushed to the rescue saturday night with exactly the words we need to hear   this country had a calling card we all knew what it was it wasn t wall street or hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought  abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january     that brought countless people  america s future  to this country  it was freedom freedom was our calling card trump wants to kill that  abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january    this country had a calling card  we all knew what it was  it wasn t wall street or hollywood or the right to bear arms that brought america s future  to this country  it was freedom   baldwin wrote   freedom was our calling card  trump wants to kill that  baldwin came to the conclusion reached by many  including a growing number of those who voted for him   trump s gota go    trump s gotta go   abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january    all the indignation is fine  but we gotta get him out  we must demand a competency test   baldwin later added   he is ill  mentally ill  all the indignation is fine but we gotta get him out we must demand a competency test he is ill mentally ill   abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january    s exactly right  unfortunately most options are going to prove to be fruitless  impeachment would require the rather enthusiastic participation of a republican controlled congress  the  amendment allows the vice president and cabinet to declare him unfit for pretty much any reason  but that requires the people trump appointed to turn on him and things are actually going pretty well for them right now as the donald checks off the neo nazi wish list items one by one  it would also require republicans in general to be halfway decent people who care about the good of their country right now  things seem hopeless but something amazing is happening  trump is bringing americans together  causing even those who once were silent in the face of right wing oppression to rise up and declare that they are not willing to take it anymore  americans as a whole are facing this adversity head on and  most importantly  together right now  our future is uncertain  but our number one duty to our country is to oppose trump s hateful agenda at every turn  our elected leaders   the ones with backbones  anyway   absolutely must obstruct trump in any way possible  our nation has never faced a test like donald trump  and it is imperative that we do not fail featured image via screengrab
