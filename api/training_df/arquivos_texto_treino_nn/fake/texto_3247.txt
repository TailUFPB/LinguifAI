get ready for the donald trump temper tantrum on twitter for the ninth consecutive year  the american people have chosen president obama as the most admired man of the year  a new gallup poll reveals president obama received  percent of the vote while donald trump only received  percent according to gallup obama s win over trump this year is largely a result of the president earning more mentions among democrats than trump receives from republicans  fifty percent of democrats named obama as most admired  compared with   of republicans choosing trump so trump is not even admired by a majority of his own party  sad and while gallup did mention that it s possible that trump could continue the trend of incumbent presidents winning the title in   it will be harder to do so if his approval ratings continue to be in the toilet but there s more  hillary clinton captured  percent of the vote to win the title of most admired woman for the  consecutive year  but melania trump  nor ivanka trump  made the list  first lady michelle obama  however  came in second clearly  the american people think much higher of president obama and hillary clinton than they do of donald trump  after all  clinton did win the popular vote in an election which russia intervened on trump s behalf had president obama been on the ballot  he more than likely would have won a third term  he is wildly popular and has strong approval ratings donald trump  on the other hand  is not popular  his approval ratings have only risen slightly since the election and americans are getting sick of his twitter tantrums he is already taking credit for things that president obama did and he is putting our foreign policy in serious jeopardy  trump is a joke as president elect  and he will continue being a joke in the white house that hostile nations will take advantage of  and trump will get even more unpopular as he signs bills to strip americans of obamacare  social security and medicare in the first few months of his administration and if he does that  he is surely going to be a one term president featured image  joe raedle getty images
