hillary clinton appeared on jimmy kimmel live on monday night and absolutely killed it jimmy kimmel has spent a lot of time on his show mocking donald trump  so it was only natural for him to talk to the democratic nominee about him the first segment of the interview was dedicated entirely to discussing the imploding republican nominee right after hillary sat down kimmel remarked that the crowd was cheering quite enthusiastically for the  co founder of isis   which drew laughter from the former secretary of state  who replied that the claim was one of the crazier things that trump has said during his campaign and with all the ridiculous things trump has said on the campaign trail  kimmel asked if she gets upset  i don t get upset anymore   clinton said   because i d be upset all the time  hillary pointed out that trump s rhetoric is music to the terrorists  ears because they would love to influence our elections in any way they can  it also gives them advertising material to use to draw new recruits considering trump s unpredictability and insanity throughout his run for the presidency  kimmel wondered how hillary is preparing to debate him  which drew a very interesting and hilarious response  i watched a lot of his debates during the primaries and he insulted all of his opponents  he insulted all the moderators  he insulted  i guess about  percent of the american people and the rest of the world  you gotta be prepared for all the wacky stuff that comes at you  i am drawing on my experience in elementary school  kimmel also asked hillary about her health and the claims of trump and his team that she is unfit to serve because she is not well  hillary compared trump s attack to a tabloid story  remarking that the national enquirer once said she would be dead in six months  but that was a long time ago and she s still full of life  i don t know why they are saying this   clinton said   i think on the one hand  it s part of the wacky strategy  just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you  on the other hand  it just absolutely makes no sense  i don t go around questioning donald trump s health  kimmel then challenged her to open a pickle jar to prove her fitness  and she opened it hillary then admitted that she had hoped to be running against someone more serious and qualified to do the job of president of the united states  i would prefer to be running against somebody who i thought was qualified to be president and temperamentally fit to be commander in chief i don t think we ve ever been confronted with somebody who we see right now in the midst of this election is unqualified and temperamentally unfit  hillary went on to name three republicans who have endorsed her and praised their decision to put country first and at the end of the interview  she read some mean quotes uttered by donald trump  but she refused to read the one of trump saying he would date his own daughter this was an excellent interview for hillary clinton  she dispelled the rampant falsehoods being pushed by trump and his minions while at the same time showing the american people that she is a positive person who is qualified for the office she seeks  now it s just a matter of waiting for the thin skinned trump to throw a hissy fit about on twitter featured image via screenshot
