trump and his minions act like they re dead certain his inaugural numbers broke records  and that the press is lying about it via deceptively edited photos and numbers that can t possibly exist  sean spicer claimed that trump s inaugural audience was the biggest in history  period  while trump himself said he could see maybe   million people out there  then spicer tried to spin it to sound like he was talking about all viewers   the live crowds  television audience  and people who streamed it online oh  well  when you put it that way  we suppose it s possible trump s inauguration was the most watched in history or is it it s not the actual numbers don t support any version of their insistence that trump s numbers broke records  the washington post did an analysis of inaugural numbers  past and present  and found that trump doesn t even rank in the top three in fact  he s in fifth place in modern history when you count the television audience  he s behind obama in   nixon in   carter in  and reagan in   in fact  reagan s   inauguration at   million is where the record is  and where it will remain  trump s   million total misses that by a hefty factor chart via the washington postamazingly enough  spicer does have one fairly accurate number   the   million people who he says streamed the inauguration  he s using it in a very deceptive way  though  that number is how many started streaming  but then switched to something else or turned it off entirely  the number of people who started streaming and stayed put was just   million at the time trump took his oath of office he s still behind reagan and obama  and also behind carter s   million and he misses obama s numbers by a whopping  million  obama had over  million presumable streaming starts for his inauguration that year  even if all  million turned it off  they didn t   obama still comes out ahead the post report also mentions that trump s audience is older than obama s audience was  so it s not nearly as likely that more of his remote viewers streamed it online rather than watched it on tv it doesn t matter how you slice it  trump s numbers were nothing special featured image by kevin dietsch via getty images
