white house press secretary sean spicer has been known for losing his sh t  just like his boss donald trump   and in an off camera news briefing on monday  spicer had a trump sized meltdown as he tried to defend the disgraceful potus from his self created wiretapping debacle pbs news hour caught spicer railing against the media on a live audio stream  capturing spicer taking a particularly hostile and defensive attitude with reporters as they asked questions about trump s unverified claims that former president barack obama had somehow tapped his phones at the trump tower at the annual conservative political action conference  cpac   trump had blasted the media for using anonymous sources  even though he often does   and even suggested that the media  shouldn t be allowed  to cite anonymous sources  reporters asked spicer about trump s anti media comments at the cpac  but this quickly launched into a discussion about trump s recent accusations against obama  as well as inquiries about what evidence trump had to back this up  spicer responded  people start taking things as fact because a series of off the record and anonymous sources   we have started to become a series of believing all these stories  and yet  i ve addressed this in the past  there s nothing there to substantiate  at some point  i would ask people to take on the record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous  off the records  as things heated up  one reporter asked for the source that trump had gotten his information from regarding the wiretapping  the reporter asked  so  explain this to me then  you re talking about not using anonymous sources   what is  then  the sourcing of the president s tweet on saturday  does he believe it s a fisa warrant  that s when poor spicey lost it  as more reporters tried to join the conversation  the wh press secretary snapped and said  there s no cameras  you can slow it down  and of course  just like the hypocrite he is  spicer couldn t provide a non anonymous source  he simply said that reports are out there  from  individuals and sources  understandably  the reporters wanted more of an answer so they continues to press spicer  this caused him to fire back again as he said  you re not on camera  you don t need to jump in  you can watch spicer lost his temper over some straightforward  simple questions below featured image via aaron p  bernstein   getty images
