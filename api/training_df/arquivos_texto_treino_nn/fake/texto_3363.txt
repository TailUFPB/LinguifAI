conservatives apparently want a witch hunt in every government department earlier this month  donald trump s transition team demanded that the energy department give them a list of names of employees who study climate change and the labs used to research it  it is assumed that trump s team wanted the names so they could fire anyone who supports what science already tells us  that climate change is real and humans have contributed to it well  the energy department told trump to go f ck themselves but now the hate group known as the family research council is calling on trump to persecute gay employees and any employee who supports lgbt rights within the state department in a letter to trump s team  tony perkins whines about how president obama and hillary clinton protected the lgbt community from anti gay bigots who want to strip them of their human rights he then complained about how america is offending some nations by hiring gay people  you know  because the family research council is a fan of how russia persecutes gay people  to carry out this extreme agenda  the obama administration has systematically filled the ranks of state with lgbtq and abortion activists   perkins wrote before calling for trump and his team to conduct a witch hunt   unless the next secretary of state is willing to resist and remove this embedded agenda  the promotion and protection of true human rights  like religious liberty  will continue to languish  that s right  perkins wants trump to be like joe mccarthy and he doubled down by literally demanding that lgbt people and those who support lgbt rights be  ferreted out  and replaced by anti gay bigots it s for this reason that i have raised concerns about the nomination of exxonmobil ceo rex tillerson for secretary of state  i certainly don t see tillerson cut from the same cloth as clinton or kerry  but he doesn t have to be for these anti life  liberal social policies to continue  he must have the courage to stop the promotion of this anti family  anti life agenda  which is very much a question mark given that he capitulated to activists pushing to liberalize the boy scouts  policy on homosexuality when he was at the helm of the organization the incoming administration needs to make clear that these liberal policies will be reversed and the  activists  within the state department promoting them will be ferreted out and will be replaced by conservatives who will ensure the state department focuses on true international human rights like religious liberty which is under unprecedented assault but donald trump was in no mood for perkins  hate and sent a strong message delivered by trump spokesman jason miller that discrimination will not be tolerated  president elect trump campaigned on a message of unity in order to bring all americans together  to think that discrimination of any kind will be condoned or tolerated in a trump administration is simply absurd  in other words  perkins can go f ck himself now  this doesn t mean that we should trust that trump will keep to his word  after all  he has repeatedly flip flopped through his campaign and ever since the election  but it should be noted that trump sent a similar message to anti bigots last month  after being asked about marriage equality  trump told  minutes that same sex marriage has been settled by the courts and that he s  fine with that  so for now  at least trump is being consistent when it comes to lgbt right  conservatives must be furious featured image  sara d  davis getty images
