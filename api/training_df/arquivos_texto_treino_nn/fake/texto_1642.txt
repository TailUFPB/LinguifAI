just as drug addicts and alcoholics tend to be in denial of their disease  former reality show star donald trump does not think he has a problem  the alleged president has not addressed opioid addiction which is sweeping across the u s   and that s probably because he  too  suffers from a type of addiction and remains in denial  donald trump needs treatment  but that would mean he d have to take a leave of absence from his job the amateur president has spent  days of his time in office visiting at least one of his properties  including  visits to his golf clubs  he s been on the job for only  days  in contrast  former president barack obama only hit the golf course once during the same amount of time in office  obama s first golf game was on april    still yet  as addicts do  trump defended his frequent weekend trips to his luxury resort and properties  saying he does not care about golfing as much as people might think he does  according to the hill  i have a lot of property  so if i go to my clubs like in new jersey  they ll say   oh he is going to play golf   i am not going to play golf   trump said in an interview on fox news   i couldn t care less about golf  well  he sure did care when obama played golf  though  in fact  there are dozens of rage tweets from trump about obama playing golf can you believe that with all of the problems and difficulties facing the u s   president obama spent the day playing golf worse than carter  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    but i have a place there that costs almost nothing because its hundreds of acres and security and they don t have to close up streets   trump added what trump means is that it costs him  nothing   we  the taxpayers  though  are paying big time  it costs us about   million a pop every time he visits his mar a lago resort  meanwhile  every visit to a trump owned property promotes it and that means there s a conflict of interest as he profits from the presidency trump did say that he feels  a little guilty  going back to his trump tower residence in new york because of all the expenses that are associated with each trip  but  he didn t mention the costs to taxpayers having to foot the bill for having several white houses  instead of one  for example  the security for melania trump in new york reportedly costs the city s police department between    and    a day to protect her and her son  the secret service had to request an additional   million in funding to protect trump and his family  i love new york  but going back is very expensive for the country because they close up fifth avenue and they close up  street   and i always feel a little bit guilty when i go there   he said trump said he does not want to be perceived as  lazy  but noted that he prefers to visit his other properties because they are not as expensive to secure  they are expensive to secure  trump s frequent visits to his florida resort have been a financial burden on the county  it would be much better if people would understand that i could go other places that i have   trump said   but then they hit me for relaxing  and i don t want to be known as a person that relaxes because i am working hard and i am working hard for the people  addiction  whether it be from drugs  alcohol  sex or golfing  is not a prejudiced disease  it can affect you whether you are black  white  orange  rich or poor  pay your taxes  or if you try to hide your taxes from the public because you pay nothing at all photo by ian macnicol getty images
