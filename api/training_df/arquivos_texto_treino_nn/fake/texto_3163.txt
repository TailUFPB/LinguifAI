kentucky republicans declared war on women as soon as the new legislative session began one of the  bills introduced on tuesday would ban abortion after  weeks of pregnancy based on the republican assertion that fetuses feel pain at that point in a pregnancy however  that assertion is not supported by science according to multiple studies  including one in   scientists generally agree that fetuses can t feel pain until well into the third trimester after  weeks  the  study suggests  weeks  this is real science  abortions after  weeks are already allowed to be limited by states under the  roe v  wade decision made by the supreme court but kentucky republicans added insult to injury by telling women that they the only choice they have is to get pregnant or not kentucky gop senate president robert stivers told the courier journal that a mother has a  choice early on to make a decision to conceive or not conceive  but once conception starts  there becomes another life involved  and the legislature has its ability to control how that life may proceed or how it would be terminated  did you hear that  kentucky ladies  a middle aged white guy just told you that you don t have a choice and that he has the right to control your body and your reproductive health decisions and you can bet republicans are going to be introducing similar bills and much worse in states across the nation and federally since republicans control congress and will have a puppet in the white house starting on january  aclu of kentucky communications director amber duke condemned legislation as  a serious threat because they ignore women s health needs in individual circumstances  we believe that women deserve dignity and should have the right to make personal and private medical decisions without interference from politicians   she said this proves once again that republicans hate women and they are even more dangerous now than ever before featured image via womansurvival com
