the republican party still hasn t learned that their wildly unpopular repeal of obamacare just isn t going to happen  even after failing miserably the first several times they tried to get their alternative to the historic health care bill passed  they are still willing to get pummeled again one of the senators who has been extremely outspoken against the gop s alternatives is speaking out again   and it s a member of their own party  sen  john mccain has just signaled that he is once again ready to shoot this health care plan down  in an interview with john dickerson on face the nation  mccain made it perfectly clear that he would not be supporting the gop s latest effort to get rid of obamacare  instead  mccain said he would rather be supporting the bipartisan amendments to the affordable care act that are currently taking place in the senate during the interview  dickerson asked mccain about trump s current outreach to the democrats  he asked   the president is working on bipartisan approach  what do you make of that   mccain actually took the side of trump and nailed the republican party for continuing to do its own thing  i m interested in that  of course  we  this president is always full of surprises  but the problem is  john  it shouldn t be bipartisanship  it should be both republican  democrat and the president  so  yes  he surprised the republicans with the deal that he made with chuck and nancy  with chuck and nancy  what it should take place is the three of them  both leaders republican and democrat and the president sit down and say  okay  we got a problem here  we need to fix it  and that means that we can come up with all three of us in one solid proposal  why did  why did obamacare fail  obamacare was ram through with democrats votes only  are we going to ram through our proposal with  with democrats and the president  that s not the way to do it  we got to go back  if i could just say again  the way to do this is have a bill  put it through the committee  we have patty murray and lamar alexander doing fine  bring it to the floor  have debate  have amendments  we passed our bill twenty seven to nothing for the armed services committee  mccain is firmly stating that he will not support a healthcare bill that the gop is imply trying to shove down everyone s throats without following any sort of legislative protocol this is bad   the republicans are rushing to get this healthcare bill passed so they can strip millions of americans of their health insurance  and they are doing it without the endorsement of the president or some of their most prominent members  this will only continue to be a massive embarrassment for conservatives  you can watch mccain rip the gop below featured image via mark wilson getty images
