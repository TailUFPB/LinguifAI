this could easily be about donald trump should he get elected in november  except that the whole nation would be sorry instead of just a single state maine already has been dealing with their own version of the republican nominee for years now and he somehow got elected and re elected as the governor and the results have been nothing short of embarrassing and disastrous so the editorial board of the portland press herald  maine s largest newspaper  apologized to the entire country on friday expressing regret that paul lepage was elevated to the office he currently occupies  dear america  maine here  please forgive us   we made a terrible mistake  we managed to elect and re elect a governor who is unfit for high office  he has a gruff exterior and blunt way of talking that some of us find refreshing  but he has shown again and again that he governs by grudge  and uses his power to beat up on people who cannot fight back  the people lepage beats up on the most are african americans and hispanics  whom the tea party governor has repeatedly blamed for crimes and drugs in the state  even going so far as to accuse them of trying to take advantage of white women in the state after they are done delivering heroin the hate and fear mongering has caused many people to think twice before relocating to the state  whose population is getting older  this has hurt industries that are desperate for new blood to remain in operation but lepage doesn t give a damn about that  if he could hang a  whites only  sign on the  welcome to maine  billboard at the state line he would do it  lepage knows that his words are widely understood to mean that he thinks that the color of their skin makes some people more likely to commit crimes  the press herald continues   rather than clarify or withdraw those statements  he repeats them and that s exactly what donald trump does  just like lepage  trump makes toxic remarks that have drawn white supremacists to his campaign while repulsing minority voters across the country only now is he pretending that he wants their votes after his poll numbers have imploded take out lepage s name and replace it with donald trump s throughout the editorial and it s a perfect match like lepage  trump often blames the media for his own blunders and makes offensive remarks that make him look like a jackass who should never have been on the ballot in the first place  lepage also doesn t apologize and has a thin skin after democratic state rep  drew gattine commented about lepage s racism  the republican governor lashed out by leaving a nasty and threatening message on his voicemail i would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist  you cocksucker   lepage said   i want to talk to you  i want you to prove that i m a racist  i ve spent my life helping black people and you little son of a bitch  socialist cocksucker  you   i need you to  just friggin    i want you to record this and make it public because i am after you  thank you  it would be nice to think that lepage would reflect on what he says and learn from these incidents  but he appears to be completely incapable of change   the press herald lamented about the incident   he will probably blame the media again for any embarrassment he suffers  but everyone has heard the tape and knows what the governor said  unfortunately  lepage will be in office until   which gives him plenty of time to do more damage and humiliate the state of maine ever more  somehow  that s the only  bright side  the press herald can think of on the bright side  america  lepage isn t going to be governor forever  and when his successor takes office in   mainers of all political parties will have to work together to fix the damage he has done to our reputation  we hope that this person will be a leader who will welcome people of all races to live in maine  and invest in our wonderful state until then  please accept our apology  we ll try not to do it again america needs to make sure that donald trump does not become president  the last thing this country needs is a paul lepage on the national level  it would be embarrassing and we would have to apologize to the entire world for all of the destruction trump causes over the next four years assuming that he doesn t somehow get re elected like lepage did in maine so let s make sure we don t have to make such an apology by making sure hillary clinton wins in november featured image  flickr
