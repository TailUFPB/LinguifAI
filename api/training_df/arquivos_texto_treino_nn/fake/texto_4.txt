pope francis used his annual christmas day message to rebuke donald trump without even mentioning his name  the pope delivered his message just days after members of the united nations condemned trump s move to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel  the pontiff prayed on monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders  we see jesus in the children of the middle east who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between israelis and palestinians   francis said   on this festive day  let us ask the lord for peace for jerusalem and for all the holy land  let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached  the pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes  and that is an issue trump continues to fight against  francis used jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy  today  as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human  societal and environmental decline  christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the child and to recognize him in the faces of little children  especially those for whom  like jesus   there is no place in the inn   he said  jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head   he added   may our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of bethlehem  the pope said that mary and joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in bethlehem  they had to leave their people  their home  and their land   francis said   this was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child    at heart  they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born  yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind  so many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of joseph and mary   francis said sunday  we see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day  we see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away  but driven from their land  leave behind their dear ones  amen to that photo by christopher furlong getty images
