at least  people  including children  were murdered at a mostly white church in texas this morning  and we re already hearing  thoughts  prayers  and may god be with them   from all the people who get millions in support from the nra  trump himself tweeted   may god be w  the people of sutherland springs  texas   he added that law enforcement was on the scene and he was  monitoring the situation from japan  however  it s extremely unlikely we ll hear calls from him about reviewing our incredibly lax gun laws anytime soon like he ranted about needing tighter immigration controls following the terrorist attack in new york city  and here s a possible reason why  the nra spent tens of millions getting trump elected in   the nra s total support for trump was over   million  the next highest spending amount was for senator richard burr of north carolina with a paltry    million source  opensecrets orgtrump is very easily bought  and he also rewards those who show him their undying loyalty  that s evidenced by every one of his cabinet picks  his promises to  drain the swamp  disappeared as soon as he was able to start rewarding his most loyal subjects by contrast  those who haven t shown sufficient loyalty are attacked  dragged through the mud  and sometimes even fired  trump can t fire the nra  but even if he could  he wouldn t because they re essentially giving each other mutual blow jobs here  in fact  one of the first bills trump signed into law was one that made it easier for people who are mentally incapable of caring for themselves get guns  he also returned their favor by appearing at their annual conference   something no president had done since ronald reagan  he s even said   you came through for me  and i am going to come through for you  so can we really expect trump to call for a review of our impossibly lax gun laws  no  because then the nra spend their millions on someone else featured image via scott olson getty images
