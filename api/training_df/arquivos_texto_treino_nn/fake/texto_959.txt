this incredibly awkward story comes from new york post reporter gabby morrongiello a source tells me trump ran around the west wing yesterday asking staff what they thought of his tweet   admitting it wasn t presidential  gabby morrongiello   gabriellahope  june    source  trump walked up to staffers saying   i know it wasn t presidential  but what did you think   https   t co   gabby morrongiello   gabriellahope  june    firing off a deranged tweet falsely claiming msnbc host mika brzezinski was bleeding from her face after a facelift  trump apparently dimly recognized that he screwed up  according to a source speaking with morrongiello  a panicking trump marched around the west wing asking people to reassure him about his tweets  heaven knows what they said  it s hard to sugarcoat something like this  his tweets were widely condemned by both republicans and democrats who recognized that the attack was clearly sexist in nature and  beneath the dignity of the office  it seems likely that trump s staff reassured him that he was right to say those things  even while privately conceding their boss is nuts  according to sources speaking with the daily beast  white house staff are on the verge of mental breakdowns over trump s behavior  which they are unable to stop senior aides to the president have tried and failed for months to find new ways to distract the president from cable news and social media and bring some level of control to his tweets  on thursday they responded to the tweetstorm with a mix of resignation and gallows humor is morrongiello s source legit  it seems probable  trump has been known to crowdsource opinions about his job performance before  early in his term  leaked audio captured trump asking guests at mar a lago for advice on who should be in his cabinet trump often appears to want to include his friends in the decision making process turning to a longtime club member that night  he said   we were just talking about who we  going to pick for the fcc  who  we going to pick for this  who we gonna accept   boy  can you give me some recommendations  trump has not apologized to mika or the nation for his behavior yesterday  instead  he sent out his best liars   sarah huckabee and kellyanne conway   to defend his use of personal attacks and lies to hurt his critics  they did so without blinking at the white house press briefing  reporters asked huckabee if trump will apologize   she ignored the question  meanwhile  trump has continued his fight with mika and her co host joe scarborough in earnest featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
