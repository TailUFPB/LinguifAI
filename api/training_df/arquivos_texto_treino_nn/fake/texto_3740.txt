one of trump s biggest campaign promises was to create jobs  and right now his plan is a massive  trillion dollar infrastructure program  sounds fantastic  right  sure  it ll cost money  but it ll mean thousands of jobs and we get our crumbling infrastructure back into shape  sweet or not  says former obama adviser ron klain  those trillions won t be poured directly into projects   they ll go to investors who then may or may not back needed infrastructure projects  klain oversaw the implementation of president obama s  recovery act  of  and knows a thing or two about this  and he believes trump s plan is actually a massive trap  trump s plan provides tax breaks to private sector investors who back profitable construction projects  these projects  such as electrical grid modernization or energy pipeline expansion  might already be planned or even underway  there s no requirement that the tax breaks be used for incremental or otherwise expanded construction efforts  they could all go just to fatten the pockets of investors in previously planned projects  how bloody fantastic   more tax cuts for the rich  in other words  the plan may or may not create jobs for americans  it may or may not actually give us the influx of dollars we need to repair our decaying infrastructure  it s a very pretty mardi gras mask placed over what s basically more government welfare for the rich and powerful in fact  klain points out that there s no guarantee that this will create jobs because there s no requirement that those dollars go to unfunded projects  he also says that it s not likely to go to projects that aren t profitable for investors  such as expanding and rebuilding water grids or repairing existing roads and bridges these investors could see up to   billion apiece with which they have to do nothing  without the necessary strings  those trillion dollars will effectively be flushed down the toilet while rich investors make themselves richer and democrats jumping on board with this plan are busy collecting their  pieces of silver  according to klain  it didn t go so well for them when they backed either ronald reagan s or george w  bush s tax cut plans because ultimately  those plans increased inequality and blew holes in the federal budget  democrats sold themselves out on those plans  though  and they re selling out again on this one worse  though  trump s infrastructure plan could actually open the door to republicans who want to weaken things like wage protection and union representation for construction workers  both of these will badly harm americans  including  and perhaps especially  the white working class democrats are taking a lot of heat over an idea that they needed to focus far more heavily on white  rural america during the election  and some democrats have jumped on the trump train s infrastructure ideas and are calling it a  jobs plan   except it s not  and it will probably hurt the working class even more  at the bare minimum  it won t help them  and then they ll blame democrats for it because reasons they ll blame democrats if trump s infrastructure plan doesn t go through  too  in other words  democrats can t win for losing  even though trump is the cartoon villain who deserves to have this land squarely on his head like a piano or a giant anvil trump s setting us up for a trillion dollar failure  all he and the republicans care about are enriching the already rich  klain is right  this is a trap  and we need to beware featured image via joe raedle getty images
