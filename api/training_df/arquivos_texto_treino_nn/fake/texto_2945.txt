things got a bit uncomfortable during rick perry s confirmation hearing for a position in a department he forgot existed  then wanted to eliminate  and literally just learned what it does  now he wants to run it  i have learned a great deal about the important work being done every day by the outstanding men and women of the doe   perry said in his opening statement at his confirmation hearing   my past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the department of energy do not reflect my current thinking  in fact  after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the department of energy  i regret recommending its elimination  the thought of rick perry being in charge of our nation s nuclear stockpile is terrifying  but we were treated to a rare bit of levity during the former texas governor s exchange with senator al franken the senator thanked trump s nominee for recently visiting him in his office   did you enjoy meeting me   franken joked  that s when things got weird  perry uttered a sentence that will almost assuredly be memed for months or even years to come  i hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch  may i rephrase that   perry asked  please  please  please   franken replied   oh my lord  oh my lord  watch it for yourself  below featured image via screengrab
