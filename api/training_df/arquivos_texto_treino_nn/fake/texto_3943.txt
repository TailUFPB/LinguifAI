in yet another bombshell report  newsweek just revealed that vladamir putin and the russian government are actively trying to help donald trump win the election because they believe he will help them weaken our nato allies the republican nominee s connections to russia have been a huge topic in the news for many months due to his compliments about putin and the fact that some of his closest campaign allies have connections to russia in addition  trump has declared that he will consider pulling united states support from nato and even strong armed the republican party to ditch a platform plank condemning russia s aggression toward ukraine and putin has rewarded trump by directing russian media to blare out support for him and russian hackers have been busy hacking american computer systems in an effort to hurt the democratic party and hillary clinton of course  trump has defended russia despite the cyber attacks being confirmed by western intelligence agencies in the united states and europe  trump was even briefed about this and yet he still denies that russia is the perpetrator and that is leading many of our closest allies to worry about what could happen if trump becomes president according to newsweek officials from two european countries told newsweek that trump s comments about russia s hacking have alarmed several nato partners because it suggests he either does not believe the information he receives in intelligence briefings  does not pay attention to it  does not understand it or is misleading the american public for unknown reasons  one british official said members of that government who are aware of the scope of russia s cyberattacks both in western europe and america found trump s comments  quite disturbing  because they fear that  if elected  the republican presidential nominee would continue to ignore information gathered by intelligence services in the formulation of u s  foreign policy and we know russia is backing trump because they ended their hacking campaign when it seemed like he would be replaced as the nominee by a sane republican  only to resume hacking on trump s behalf when he wasn t replaced when trump launched into an inexplicable attack on the parents of a muslim american soldier who died in combat  the kremlin assumed the republican nominee was showing himself psychologically unfit to be president and would be forced by his party to withdraw from the race  as a result  moscow put its hacking campaign temporarily on hold  ending the distribution of documents until trump stabilized  both personally and in the polls  according to reports provided to western intelligence and the united states election is not the only one russia has interfered with  the kremlin also spread misinformation that helped right wingers take control in germany and caused the united kingdom to vote in favor of brexit  both of which help russia weaken alliances but their true target is nato  which is what stands in the way of russia overpowering europe  and our allies fear that a trump victory on november  would embolden russia to do just that officials in western europe say they are dismayed that they now feel compelled to gather intelligence on a man who could be the next president of the united states  but believe they have no choice  moscow is seen as a direct threat to their interests both in its aggressive efforts to reshape global alliances and for its power to damage western europe  which obtains almost  percent of its natural gas from russia  should the united states  the last remaining superpower  tilt its policies away from nato to the benefit of russia  the alliance between america and western europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways  and so  for perhaps the first time since world war ii  countries in western europe fear that the american election  should trump win  could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades here s video of rachel maddow explaining how big this news is via youtube oh  and one more thing  while donald trump and republicans continue to whine about how hillary clinton used a private server  it turns out hillary was smart to do so because the russians hacked into the state department email system  which means if she had used that system her emails would have been obtained by the russian government so russia literally wants trump to win so they can use him as their puppet to gain more influence in the world  which means more war  less democracy  and a united states that is weaker that cannot be allowed to happen  clearly  the russians like trump  and that should make all americans cast their votes for hillary clinton featured image  youtube
