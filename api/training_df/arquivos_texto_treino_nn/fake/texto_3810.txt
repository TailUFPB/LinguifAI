donald trump has no idea wtf he is doing  none  i know  shocking  right  thankfully  president obama has decided to take pity on him  or maybe he s really taking pity on us  and is planning to help trump figure out just how this president gig actually works after winning the election on tuesday  trump visited the white house to meet with obama and formally begin the process of transition  sources familiar with the meeting told the wall street journal that it quickly became abundantly clear that trump was completely clueless  trump and his team didn t even know that they were responsible for staffing the west wing  the president has concluded that  for the good of the entire country  he is going to have to help his successor try to learn a thing or two the wsj reports  during their private white house meeting on thursday  mr  obama walked his successor through the duties of running the country  and mr  trump seemed surprised by the scope  said people familiar with the meeting  trump aides were described by those people as unaware that the entire presidential staff working in the west wing had to be replaced at the end of mr  obama s term  after meeting with mr  trump  the only person to be elected president without having held a government or military position  mr  obama realized the republican needs more guidance  he plans to spend more time with his successor than presidents typically do  people familiar with the matter said  to say that trump is inexperienced is a grave understatement  he and all the people that he has working for him  who are the best people if you remember  couldn t manage to google this shit  but president obama  being the true leader that he is  has decided that he will take one for the team and spend his last days in office mentoring the buffoon who will take his place  thanks  obama featured image via win mcnamee getty images
