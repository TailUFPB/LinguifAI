anyone who is faced with the unfortunate task of defending donald trump s many lies and erratic behavior eventually crumbles  we saw this with former white house press secretary sean spicer  and we re seeing it again with current press secretary sarah huckabee sanders earlier today  huckabee sanders fell apart in front of reporters as she tried to redirect the conversation about trump s false claim that the senate has enough votes to replace the affordable care act  when a reporter grilled her on graham cassidy  the gop s latest health care disaster  huckabee sanders practically admitted that trump had been lying the whole time and that the votes were not there  she said  the point that we re making is that we have the votes on the substance  but not necessarily on the process  which is why we are so confident that we can move healthcare forward and get it done in the spring  huckabee sanders  like all of trump s minions  is well versed in diversion tactics but still couldn t avoid exposing her boss  blatant lie  trump does not have the votes to pass graham cassidy  and he was lying through his teeth about it  no matter how huckabee sanders tried to conceal the truth  it was too obvious to be hidden many   including republicans   already believe that graham cassidy is dead  if the bill can t get enough votes on the process  the bill cannot pass  trump lied  and this is just another humiliating failure for his administration and the republican party you can watch huckabee sanders struggle to hold it together below trump can t hide his major failures behind his spokespeople anymore  and his lies are wearing thin  the public is giving him far less leniency now as his approval rating continues to dwindle  trump s team is in big trouble if they keep trying to cover up his lies featured image via win mcnamee    getty images
