every major party presidential candidate in the last  years has released his or her tax returns  except for two  one was gerald ford and the other was donald trump  trump  who s completely embroiled in a scandal surrounding ties to russia  may soon be forced  at court or congressional order  to release his returns  but if that doesn t happen  democrats at the state level might be forcing trump s hand state legislatures are now proposing measures that would ban any candidates from their ballots who don t release tax returns  tax return information would provide some transparency there to give voters the assurance that they need that the president is acting on behalf of us   said kathleen clyde  an ohio state representative who recently introduced a version of the bill   it is problematic that he is the only candidate in  or  years not to provide that information  clyde s bill  the tax returns uniformly made public act   the trump act   would require candidates for president and vice president to disclose five years of tax documents to ohio s secretary of state  who would then post the documents online  only after a candidate disclosed the tax information would he or she qualify for the ballot in one of the nation s most hotly contested battlegrounds similar measures requiring candidates to file with secretary of state offices have been introduced in california  oregon and tennessee  candidates would be required to file tax documents with state boards of election under bills filed in illinois  maryland  new york and rhode island source  the hillso far   states are considering similar bills and not all of them are blue  but it s probably that only blue states will pass the bills  if at all elections  even national elections  are run by the states  nationally  there are only two qualifications to run for president  the candidate must be at least  years old and must be a natural born citizen  none of the rest matters in the eyes of the law  that s why trump didn t have to release his tax returns to begin with however  states have more latitude  for example  in many states  candidates must receive a minimum number of signatures on a petition before being allowed on a ballot  although that typically applies to non major party candidates  still  states can impose rules like filing fees and deadlines  although it s still not clear that forcing candidates to release tax returns will pass constitutional muster even if this passes in a few states  trump could still  if he doesn t implode  win reelection if he wins enough red states  in theory  he could win without a single vote in our most populous state  california   as long as he won the electoral college  let s hope these bills do pass to prevent a future trump  but first  let s pressure congress to force trump s hand right now featured image via pool getty images
