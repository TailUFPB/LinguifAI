in case you haven t heard  eric trump recently had to cancel an auction in which he was using his charity as a front to sell access to his father s administration  recently the eric trump foundation announced an auction for coffee with his sister  incoming first lady ivanka  who will be serving as an adviser to her father and occupying the space in the white house normally reserved for the president s spouse to any casual onlooker  this is exactly the sort of situation that used to cause trump to scream  lock her up   but now that he s president  the obvious conflict of interest presented by the sale of access to those closest to the president elect doesn t matter much to him  on friday  the donald took to twitter to whine that his family can t sell access to his administration my wonderful son  eric  will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    presidency  isn t this a ridiculous shame  he loves these kids  has raised millions of dollars for them  and now must stop  wrong answer   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december     nothing is stopping any of the trumps from donating their own money  or encouraging direct donations to st  jude  the organization that was allegedly going to receive the money  anytime the trumps and charity are mentioned   allegedly  is appropriate until it actually happens   but for them to think it is in any way ok to sell access to ivanka no matter the reason is just asinine  it s conflicts like this that caused obama to prohibit members of his family from directly raising money for anyone  no matter the cause the obama administration prohibited any member of the first family from directly soliciting charitable donations  said norm eisen  who served as an ethics lawyer early in president obama s tenure  mr  obama and his wife  michelle  have attended occasional charitable fund raising events  including the congressional black caucus annual dinners  the obamas also allowed their daughters  high school to auction off magazines they had signed  mr  eisen said  but they did not auction off access to themselves  you never  ever want to have government officials using their public office for the private gain  even for a worthy charity   mr  eisen said   that was how we did it  eric trump  like his father  whined that he can t raise money by selling his sister despite getting by just fine without that sort of thing in the past  i get that people will try to use anything they can for their own interests   trump said   the reality is  i ve been raising money for sick kids far longer than  his dad has been involved in politics   eric trump told the new york times  though he did explain that he understands  the quagmire  presented by what he had hoped he would not get caught doing naturally  in what is almost becoming a daily ritual  twitter swarmed trump s morning bloviating whinefest and once again hammered him into oblivion  realdonaldtrump sorry your children can t get the tax deduction on your name  but people should donate directly to st  jude   tony posnanski   tonyposnanski  december    realdonaldtrump remember when you used trump foundation money to buy a big picture of yourself  sell it  give the kids the cash   emma kennedy   emmakennedy  december    realdonaldtrump you could always quit and let him continue his stellar work  the world will thank you   cameron atfield   cameronatfield  december    realdonaldtrump just an idea  maybe spend some of that nuke money on helping kids   matt peterson   mattbpete  december    realdonaldtrump your  wonderful son  was trying to sell access to you in the name of charity  shame   draintheswamp  neal gottlieb   nealhgottlieb  december     realdonaldtrump yeah quit your bullshit  and quit using sick kids to do it  write a fucking check like the rest of us  erictrump  nastycoco   headocolettuce  december    realdonaldtrump  realdonaldtrump before you go any further   he was selling access to you  exactly what you railed on hillary about  buster   americasdad  december    realdonaldtrump he is no longer allowed to auction off access to a powerful family  do you really not understand this  quit whining  lead   kim wright   kimwrightw  december    realdonaldtrump no  it s not wrong and you ragged on clinton you early stage dementia patient   andrew mastrandonas   andrewmindc  december    realdonaldtrump yes was the wrong answer to  do you want to be president  if you wished your grifter family to avoid high profile conflicts  mrs  betty bowers   bettybowers  december    realdonaldtrump hrc s foundation brings hiv treatment drugs to thousands of africans and you painted it as beyond evil   hypocritetrump  doug  jax  taylor   dougyluvfoxy  december     trump neglected to mention that eric trump s foundation was busted funneling nearly    million to his father s businesses  nor did he tell people about the fact that his son lies about where the money goes or the fact that the etf spent    on a painting of eric s dad  the daily beast reports though the eric trump foundation s website says   we exclusively support st  jude children s research hospital   that isn t the case  in   etf began donating in earnest to other causes  cutting small checks to  individual charities in addition to the outsize donation given to the children s hospital  some of these small donations like the    to the american society for enology and viticulture  a california wine industry organization where eric trump once gave a keynote address have seemingly little to do with the charity s mission of helping sick children by   it had given    to the little baby face foundation  a controversial charity run by a manhattan plastic surgeon that provides surgery for children with big noses  large ears  and other more serious facial deformities so they can face bullies at school one which critics have warned sends a warped message to such young children despite the claim that all the gifts in etf s silent auction would be donated  the foundation also paid    to an artist s foundation in exchange for a portrait of donald trump that was sold at the  golf invitational to eric trump  who hung it over his livingroom sofa  eric trump did not respond to a request for comment seeking the purchase price would the money have actually gone to st  jude  there s truly no way of knowing given the previous lies and shady dealings   but it is never ok for the president s family to sell access  period featured image via screengrab getty images  jeff j  mitchell
