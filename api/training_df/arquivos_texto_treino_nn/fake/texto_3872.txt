sometimes  it sucks to take the high road   when they go low  we go high  has  sadly  led to loss   and now  in defeat  hillary clinton is being way too nice even still no  seriously  go check her twitter right now  in case you can t  here are some screenshots that might make you feel a little sick  it s generic  tin can conceding politician stuff  but she s still wrong  and shouldn t be saying those things  see  here s the deal  republicans are going to use this election say they have a mandate from the american people to basically do whatever the hell they want but they don t  they spent eight years blocking president barack obama and the democratic party from doing almost anything   they wouldn t even hold a vote on president obama s scotus nominee  add that to the fact that donald trump likely lost the popular vote  and that republicans lost seats in the house of representatives  despite outrageously gerrymandered districts that very literally make democratic votes count less  and a seat in the senate  and the reality here is that republicans barely managed to win an election that was heavily rigged in their favor unfortunately for progressive causes and the millions of people that will be adversely affected by whitelash   it s unlikely that democratic senators will be willing to take things as far as their colleagues across the aisle  it s hard to see democrats stomping their feet and shutting down the government  for example  the tea party  by contrast  will do literally anything to accomplish their goals  and call this  principled   in american politics  it looks like the willingness to stick by ideology no matter what is more of a winner than being reasonable or pragmatic the truth is that we don t owe republicans a damn thing  at this point  all we can hope is that the democrats in the senate keep a strong spine  stay  principled   and refuse to let republicans accomplish as many parts of  the most conservative platform in history  as possible  they have no mandate  the people did not vote for this  and it s up to what few blue leaders we have left to do everything they can to control the damage featured image by justin sullivan getty images
