for decades  bill o reilly has poisoned the airwaves with his racism  sexism  and right wing rhetoric on fox news  not anymore the exodus of advertisers from his show on the conservative propaganda network finally tipped the scales against o reilly  years of sexually harassing his female colleagues  being a domestic abuser  and lying about being a war correspondent were apparently not enough to justify firing him earlier  but lost advertiser dollars struck the killing blow on o reilly s pathetic career new york magazine reports according to sources briefed on the discussions  network executives are preparing to announce o reilly s departure before he returns from an italian vacation on april   now the big questions are how the exit will look and who will replace him o reilly went on  vacation  after the new york times revealed that fox news has spent   million settling sexual harassment lawsuits against o reilly over the years in response to the revelation  o reilly played the victim  the worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer  the fox news channel   o reilly said but the fact that fox news paid off o reilly s many accusers rather than fight them in court makes it pretty clear that fox knew they would not win once the new york times story got out  companies who advertise on o reilly s show began pulling their ads in droves  the allegations are disturbing and  given the importance of women in every aspect of our business  we don t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now   mercedes benz said in a statement and that s pretty much the stance every other company has taken to explain why they are pulling their advertising of course  o reilly had his defenders as well serial sexual predator donald trump  who admitted he grabs women by their genitals without their consent  defended him  i don t think bill did anything wrong   trump said   i think he s a person i know well   he is a good person  trump s decision to weigh in didn t help o reilly at all  a majority of women in this country fiercely oppose him  and trump s past statements about women and his past treatment of women was just another example of a sexual predator defending a fellow sexual predator fox news is expected to publicly announce o reilly s departure soon  but they won t say he was fired  they ll make up some bullshit about how this was a mutual decision and they ll say nothing but good things about o reilly  o reilly will likely whine and claim that he s the real victim but the impact of o reilly s firing will last for years  conservatives love his show and he was a ratings winner for a network that has started to struggle megyn kelly s departure from the network was a major blow  losing o reilly as well will be crushing  ratings have already dipped and fox news  audience is aging fox news and conservatives are going to miss o reilly  the majority of the country  however  are going to say  good riddance  featured image  addicting info screenshot
