donald trump attacked the first amendment on tuesday and george takei clobbered him for it trump called for jailing americans who burn the flag  and suggested they be stripped of their citizenship as further punishment nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag   if they do  there must be consequences   perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    the flag is a form of expression that is protected by the constitution  the supreme court has ruled that way twice  and that included support from justice antonin scalia  whom conservatives often hail as a hero trump s tweet immediately drew massive condemnation from people on both sides of the aisle  even fox legal analyst andrew napolitano blasted trump for his blatantly unconstitutional statement but trump also pissed off someone else george takei also went after trump  and his perspective on the subject gives him far more standing on this subject than trump will ever have i pledged allegiance to the flag every morning inside an internment camp  i would never burn one  but i d die to protect the right to do so  https   t co   george takei   georgetakei  november    anyone had reason to burn a flag it s george takei  he never did so  but that was his choice  despite this  he is still defending people who choose to burn it because it s freedom of expression  and takei actually made another point  there are people who have been mistreated under our flag in this country  taking away their right to express their anger would only marginalize people and that is not right takei wasn t done though  he posted another tweet later reminding trump that he is responsible for protecting and defending the constitution now  so he better do his damn job mr  trump  one of your sacred duties as president will be to uphold the constitution  that means honoring and protecting free speech   george takei   georgetakei  november    lot of people may find the act of burning the flag reprehensible and that s their right  but there are also those who see burning a flag as a message to the government in opposition of a policy or a lack of action to fix an issue  silencing this form of expression would be tyrannical  if trump is allowed to take away this form of freedom of speech  nothing stops him from taking away other freedoms as well  at that point  we might as well rip up the constitution featured image  spencer platt getty images
