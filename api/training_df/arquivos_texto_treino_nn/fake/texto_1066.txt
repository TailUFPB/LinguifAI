the senate republicans have attracted loads of criticism and backlash for being super shady and secretive while creating their latest version of the american health care act   and rightfully so  this has taken place behind closed doors  with very little information being let out to the american public  luckily  some gopers are taking a stand against it rep  pete king  r ny  didn t mince his words as he railed against his fellow conservative lawmakers  in an interview with long island radio host jay oliver earlier today  king went off on senate republicans and accused them of  trying to hide something  in a blistering rant  king said  listen  there has to be private meetings all the time  but i think there should be more public debate on it  it looks like they re trying to hide something and it does add to conspiracy theories and everything else  oliver suggested that the secrecy of the republican party over this made it look like senate gopers were trying to do something  underhanded   and king couldn t agree more  proving that there are some republicans who actually do have spines  king said  this looks too secretive  it s going to put a cloud over the whole final product keeping america and other politicians in the dark is a bad move for senate republicans  and will likely result in failure  many democrats and gopers are highly concerned about what s being done in these senate meetings  and many are openly condemning the drafting process  you can listen to king trash the senate below king has spoken his mind before  many times against his own party  king trashed the gop a second time today when it came to the victory of karen handel last night in georgia s special election  while many gopers were celebrating  king criticized trump for his twitter behavior  and told the tweet happy potus don t bother tweeting  featured image via win mcnamee getty images
