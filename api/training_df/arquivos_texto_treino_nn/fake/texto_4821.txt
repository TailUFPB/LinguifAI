trump s first immigration speech following his humiliation in mexico wednesday was a bunch of sure to please the klan hate speech mixed with a heaping spoonful of xenophobia and just enough mindblowing stupidity to make one wonder if he or she is hearing the things that were definitely coming out of the donald s face anus trump returned to his familiar message of  deport all the brown people    no citizenship for any of them   and even brought back a deportation force so strong  so powerful  that it could banish hillary clinton from these united states faster than you can say  avada kedavra  in the aftermath of what could possibly be trump s most hate filled speech yet  legendary newsman dan rather hopped on facebook and set fire to all that is trump rather noticed  as did we all  that trump s supposed policy speech was light on the policy and heavy on the  hate  speech  he claimed it would be a detailed policy address  and yet from the start his tone was a seething  angry attack on what he described as a world of dangerous murderers and rapists who seem to be roaming  sanctuary cities   rather notes   focusing on a few isolated and already well documented tragedies  he painted the entire undocumented world with the casual brush of violence  i expected a law and order theme  but not this level of searing rhetoric  of course  i shouldn t have been surprised   he continues   trump feeds off his crowds and they were giving it right back  it was ultimate in the  us vs  them  mentality  real americans vs  others  i frankly saw echoes of the george wallace speeches from the  campaign   he goes on the applause lines seemed like ready red meat for this crowd and i am sure for those who regularly watch fox news  they were names and anecdotes that frankly will be unknown to most americans  that s because donald trump s america does not comport with what many voters see in their own lives  it was an attack on  thugs  and those on  welfare   i suppose there was a structure to this speech  he would say  and     and   as if it were a detailed list of proposal  but any sense of order was swamped by a tsunami of rhetoric and tone  but any details are beside the point  with a raspy roar  leaning over the podium  trump delivered his message with glee   this is our country and we are being overwhelmed by hordes not fit to be in our country   he says   he suggested that  these people  are well known to law enforcement and could be rounded up with ease  it was a line that seemed more in keeping with the culture of the old east germany than the united states   we have got to have a county folks  he summed it up   under a trump administration it s called america first  noting that it is a  fools errand  to attempt to fact check trump s jumbled mess of a speech  he ends with a warning to all who read his words make no mistake  this was a toxic mix of jingoism  nativism  and chauvinism  many of you would like to think  not in america  not in our country could this type of rhetoric gain currency  but in other countries  and in other times in history  we have seen the impossible become possible to horrific effect  trump is betting his political future on this idea   that there is a deep  tribal  and dark sea of the molten lava of hate and aggrievement  this volcano from below appeals to dangerous instincts  can it yield a path to the presidency and power pay attention  don t try to pretend  it can t happen again   don t stand up  stomp your foot and say  not in my america   and don t you dare say  we won t let it happen   by ignoring trump  or by pretending that he doesn t stand a chance to win  you re letting it happen november    be there read his entire message below featured image via screengrab getty images kirk irwin
