donald trump is a clear and present threat to the united states of america  that fact is indisputable at this point  after all  a senator in his own party just said so in strikingly blunt terms  however  the gop controlled house has been silent on trump s dangerous antics  because they fear his lighting them up on twitter  and they also fear retaliation by his crazy base at the ballot box  but it seems that rep  al green  d  tx  has had enough on wednesday afternoon  rep  green took the floor of the house of representatives and formally introduced articles of impeachment against trump  green began  i rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough  green went on to say that trump s being in the white house is is fueling an alt right hate machine   which is currently  causing immediate injury to american society   on top of that  green introduced his articles as  privileged   meaning  that the house needs to take them up within the next two days now  obviously this will go nowhere  those craven republicans don t care that trump is destroying the country  just as long as they get every bigoted right wing fever dream they ve had for the last eight years codified into law  with a few tax cuts for rich people thrown in  oh  just for fun in short  these republicans know that trump is unfit  and could even land us in a nuclear holocaust if he can t be kept away from the nuclear codes  in fact  at this point  any responsible person will do what was done to president nixon in his final days  when he reportedly was drinking heavily and wandering the halls of the white house conversing with portraits of dead presidents  at that time  secretary of state henry kissinger and soon to be president gerald ford insisted that those responsible for launching nuclear weapons went through them rather than nixon  because they knew nixon to be dangerous general john kelly  secretary of state rex tillerson  and other adults in the room had better be doing the same with trump  who is much more dangerous than nixon ever dreamed of being please  someone show some courage in the republican house and go along with rep  green  it s time to impeach trump watch rep  green s remarks below featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
