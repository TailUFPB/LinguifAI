the comedy central roasts of celebrities are well known and hilarious  for the most part  while it doesn t look like the roastees know what s going on  and that everything is entirely off the cuff  the truth is that there is a lot of preparation ahead of the actual roast  roastees get some input  even getting to tell the comedy writers what subjects are off limits for jokes  but  beyond that  they don t dictate very much and then there s donald trump  putting his roast together seems to have been one long  horrific chore for the comedy central team assigned to it  in fact  that roast is perhaps some of the strongest evidence we ve got that trump is unconscionably thin skinned  and will continue to be after the election  roastees for the comedy central roasts know what s involved  they know they re going to be skewered  if they don t like the idea  they don t have to do it it makes us want to look at trump and say   duh   at comedy central  trump apparently wanted to dictate everything  all the way down to the level of beauty in the women who were to escort him on stage  according to the stage manager  the proposed woman   trump said  was  not somebody he wanted to be associated with at that moment   ferkle recalled   in other words  she was not pretty enough  to appease trump  comedy central moved the actress elsewhere on the stage  ferkle said  the show went on  that s fairly typical trumpian misogyny  so not all that surprising  what s perhaps more surprising were the other ways that trump drove the staff up the wall  for instance  he was apparently giving the show s writers and producers hell over whether jokes about his hair were allowed  the lead writer  ray james  tried working with trump on why hair jokes were a necessary part of the roast  trump resisted  because of course he did  i had to explain to him why he needed to have some jokes about his own hair  i said   you have to own it  if you have a great hair joke  you will be impervious to hair jokes   instead  trump kept nixing the hair jokes  and wanted to replace one of them with a simple   look how great  looks  because that s just hilarious  but perhaps the most annoying thing was that the writers had to draft multiple rebuttals for trump  the rebuttal comes at the end of the roast  when the roastee gets up and turns it all back on his or her roasters  trump was returning scripts marked up entirely with black sharpies  including blacking out punchlines nobody blacks out punchlines  according to the roast s producers and writers  one writer  jesse joyce  said  i have done this a long time and nobody blacks out punchlines   a classic lack of an understanding of how a joke works  and trump couldn t be consistent about his edits  if  indeed  they can be called that   either  he took out some opportunities to be crass while wallowing in others  he also changed some of the jokes from  funny  to  not funny   again  showing a fundamental unwillingness to even try and understand what was being put before him  trump made a few lackluster attempts at cracking wise  he changed a joke meant to slam  macfarlane from   the only way you ll ever draw a crowd is with a pencil   trump s revision   the only crowd you ll attract is flies   he also wanted to roast the entire dais at once by  well  being entirely himself  how this is even a joke is beyond us  since everything he does is to feel superior to everyone on the planet  their  all losers and i like associating with loser because it makes me feel even better about myself  it got to the point where ray james just wanted to destroy trump in any way possible  i begged any writer to get on board   james said   let s write jokes about this guy having a small cock    i wanted to destroy this man and expose him as having a tiny penis because that will hurt him more than any jokes about his family or orange skin   that didn t work  furthermore  given the fact that trump just had to talk about his penis size in response to rubio s jab about his tiny hands during a televised debate  it s likely the dick jokes probably wouldn t have made it in anyway  if they had  he probably would have lost it up onstage the entire roast was classic trump  he sat on the stage with a tight smile  not really responding  much the same way he did at the  white house correspondents dinner when obama roasted him  despite knowing what was coming  he couldn t take anyone making fun of him and probably relished trying to hurt them back comedy central s president sees the roast as prophetic of what s happening today  it is impossible to not see how absurd the whole thing is  if you go back and watch the roast  there re probably a lot of oddly prophetic things being said that are relevant today  but just the idea that someone who did a comedy central roast  a major party  for president is pretty shocking  especially when that person couldn t handle being criticized  teased  or otherwise treated as anything other than the god he thinks he is featured image by andrew h  walker getty images
