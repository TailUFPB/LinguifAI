donald trump s presidency is still one of the most baffling train wrecks americans have seen in a long time  if his racist  misogynist rhetoric and pathological lying weren t enough to raise concerns about  his twitter activity alone should have prevented people from voting for him   and for those that had hope for him  he s been busy proving them wrong every single day since he got in the white house he hasn t even lasted a month in his new role yet  and already people are scrambling to find ways to get rid of him before he destroys the country  with his massive amounts of inhumane executive orders and reckless handling of world affairs  trump s mental competency is under scrutiny   and for good reason on saturday  trump launched into one of his insane twitter fits  and this time he was more incoherent than ever  he not only whined about  fake news  and the new york times  but he attacked the  so called judge  who dared to block his disgusting muslim ban  oh  and let s not forget about the fact that trump also shared a fake article about kuwait  forcing the country to respond and the situation to erupt in chaos before the situation was corrected given the emotional roller coaster that the trump presidency has already become in such a short amount of time  many people are calling for him to have a psychological review   and one of those people is rep  ted lieu  d ca   who took a look at trump s twitter tantrum and asked the question we ve all been wanting to know  here it is  should he get a mental health exam  hell yes  a few hours later  lieu fired back at trump again for posting yet another weird  narcissistic tweet  his campaign slogan   make america great again  it would be in america s best interest if trump were professionally evaluated  lieu is not the only politician calling for a psychological review  either  earlier this week  top democrat nancy pelosi spoke out in support of having mental evaluations for presidents   which we all know would have destroyed every chance trump had like him or hate him  trump is not well and being in his role is not only dangerous for him  but for the rest of the world featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
