donald trump s obsession with lashing out at people on twitter instead of attending national security briefings caused michael moore to plead with him to do his job say what you want about the filmmaker  no one can deny that michael moore is absolutely right about this issue no matter what side of the political aisle you are on during an appearance on late night with seth meyers  moore pointed out that trump has only attended  out of  daily briefings offered to him since election day needless to say  these briefings are incredibly important because they give president elects the opportunity to learn more about the threats facing our nation so they are prepared for whatever may happen during their term in office  and as this country brutally learned in   these briefings can warn us about possible terrorist attacks so that we can try to prevent them but george w  bush was not engaged as he should have been during his first year as president and also missed or ignored daily briefings  one of those briefings warned that osama bin laden was poised to launch a terrorist strike against the united states using airplanes bush went fishing and america suffered the consequences on september  but trump is even worse than president bush  he would rather spend his time bashing saturday night live on twitter instead of attending a briefing that may warn of another terrorist attack  and that puts our nation at serious risk  as a ceo  trump s biggest concern was how to make a profit  now he has a job that includes being responsible for the lives and safety of all americans  but he isn t taking it seriously and michael moore looked into the camera and spoke directly to trump asking him to do his job  you have to pay attention  you have to attend these briefings   moore said   this is our country  this is our security  this is our safety  you re horsing around with all this nonsense  and you re not doing your no   job  and the no   job of the president is to make sure the country is safe  i m asking you to do your job  for the sake of the people who may end up dead  here s the video via youtube donald trump needs to start taking the presidency seriously  that means attending the daily briefings and studying up on how things work instead of being on twitter all the time  because if trump doesn t do his job  the next terrorist attack will be his fault  and republicans will not have anyone else to blame but themselves featured image  screenshot
