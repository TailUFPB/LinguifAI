donald trump may be trying to destroy the  failing  new york times  but it seems that his rhetoric has just made the publication more popular than ever  sending subscriptions  though the roof  according to an editor these days  any publication that prints something trump doesn t like is anything ranging from  fake news  to  fake news  to  very fake news   trump has never provided a guide to how he defines each of the terms    and the new york times is one of his favorite targets for criticism what with all the truth telling and whatnot over the weekend  trump said the new york times   which has won more than  pulitzer prizes   is  failing  but the newspaper s executive editor dean baquet says it s actually quite the opposite   and trump is helping immensely  trump is the best thing to happen to the times  subscription strategy   baquet says   every time he tweets it drives subscriptions wildly  our digital subscriptions are through the roof  our print subscriptions are up   but he warns that it is important to realize the motivation behind trump s statements  no matter how much the donald is driving subscriptions  if you look at the pattern of the president s tweets  they re actually designed to minimize the institutions who are charged with holding him accountable  and i think that s dangerous  baquet also hit back at trump s recent demonization of anonymous sources  in an administration that has expressed so much distaste for the press and so much distaste for our role  are you surprised that some of the people who want to criticise the administration want to do it without their names attached  i m not  he s been an anonymous source throughout his career  especially when it helped him and when it burnished his reputation   he added  referencing trump s habit of providing information   true or not   under fake names on monday  sean spicer clarified that all press isn t  as trump says   the enemy of the american people   only the new york times and politico and all the other organizations trump calls  fake news    in other words  those who criticize him   are the  enemy  it is clear what trump is doing  it is clear that he needs to be stopped  let s make that happen featured image via getty images chip somodevilla
