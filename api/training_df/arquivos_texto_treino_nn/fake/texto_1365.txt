donald trump s visit to israel had a stop at yad vashem  israel s holocaust remembrance and memorial museum  as is customary for foreign dignitaries  trump was asked to sign the visitor s log and share some of his thoughts about his experience and emotions while there  and as is customary for trump  he took it as an opportunity to pen a painfully simplistic note which missed the whole point of the visit how did trump feel after a visit to one of the most somber places in the world  meant to mark an atrocity that led to the deaths of  millions european jews  he was happy he got to hang out with his friends our president couldn t muster anything more sophisticated than a note scribbled in your  grade yearbook by a classmate you barely knew and lest trump s supporters think it s normal to keep it short and  extremely  simple  former president barack obama wrote in the same visitor s log years ago   he wrote out a passionate mediation on what the visit meant to him  it spanned a page one striking thing about the comparison  obama devotes his closing lines to the victims of the holocaust  both living and dead  trump mentions his  friends   but doesn t spare a single word for the victims  it s a telling oversight for an administration that already dabbled in the erasure of jewish holocaust victims  his white house faced outrage after its official holocaust remembrance statement left out jewish victims and never mentioned antisemitism  shortly after  trump s press secretary falsely claimed that hitler never gassed any of  his own people    a line many took to mean german jews were not considered  german  by the trump administration trump claims he will  never forget  but it s not entirely clear he ever knew in the first place it also may be a further sign that trump s mental faculties are not what they once were  in a powerful piece published on the health news website stat  sharon begley explored the ways trump s vocabulary and articulation have diminished to a staggering degree  in short  it s not just you  even the experts agree trump s speech sounds like that of a small child without a firm command of language  the implications for this are troubling although neither johnson nor other experts stat consulted said the apparent loss of linguistic fluency was unambiguous evidence of mental decline  most thought something was going on john montgomery  a psychologist in new york city and adjunct professor at new york university  said  it s hard to say definitively without rigorous testing  of trump s speaking patterns   but i think it s pretty safe to say that trump has had significant cognitive decline over the years  and that s putting it lightly featured image via lior mizrahi getty images
