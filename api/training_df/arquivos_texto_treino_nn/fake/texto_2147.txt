according to white house press secretary sean spicer  kellyanne conway s completely serious suggestion that president obama used  microwaves  to spy on donald trump was simply a remark made  in jest  ever since trump s prized idiot first claimed that obama used microwave ovens to keep tabs on the donald  experts have weighed in  pointing out that you d have to be the biggest moron in the universe to believe for even a second that it is a  fact of modern life   as conway says  that a microwave is useful for spying on someone  during his tuesday press briefing  a reporter with a  what the fuck am i even saying is this really what my life has become   look on her face asked spicer if donald trump  believes he was surveilled through microwaves and televisions  i will just say the president has tweeted about this   spicer replied   he s pretty clear that he believes there was surveillance that was conducted during the  election  and we re going to wait for the conclusion of that  i think there is pretty sound evidence that the microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone  and i think that has been cleaned up  it was made in jest  so i think we can put that to rest  sorry  spicy  conway and the trump administration will never live down the ridiculous assertion that barack obama spied on trump through the microwave   especially as long as you choose to cling to the equally ridiculous notion that our last legitimate president tapped the  wires  at trump tower to spy on the campaign watch spicer try to put the whole microwave thing to rest below
