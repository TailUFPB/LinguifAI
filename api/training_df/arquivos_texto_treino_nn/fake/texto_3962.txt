it wasn t too long ago that republican nominee donald trump made us feel sick to our stomach when he told gold star parent khizr khan  the father of a muslim soldier that was killed defending this country  that he had  made a lot of sacrifices  it was a disgusting claim  as few people have been as entitled as trump   but his campaign is back at it again  trying to depict trump as someone who has actually worked hard on thursday  trump campaign manager kellyanne conway insisted that the reason people were voting for trump was because they appreciated all of the sacrifices he made by running for the white house  in a completely delusional interview with cnn s chris cuomo  conway said  donald trump is closing with a positive message  he s talking about his love for the country  his love for the people  what he s going to do to help them solve everyday problems  and hillary clinton  unfortunately  has gone lower and lower  they re going totally negative  obviously  the trump campaign is now ignoring the fact that its entire campaign strategy has been negative  hateful and divisive  conway s next statement was even more ridiculous  because trump has tanked horribly with female voters and shown that he has zero respect for them throughout his entire life  female voters especially don t like that  they feel they deserve and should be respected to have a substantive conversation  conway called trump  who has scammed and insulted more people than we can count throughout his campaign   incredibly gracious and really funny  and he s doing this for all the right reasons  i mean  i think people will look back at this campaign   particularly after he wins on tuesday   and they ll say  we totally missed how much america just appreciated  how much america appreciated the fact that he and his family made enormous sacrifices to run for president  really   enormous sacrifices   this statement is just as sickening as when trump mentions that  small  loan of one million dollars that his father gave him as he whines about how hard his life has been as a wealthy white male  trump and his family basically had riches handed to them  and they haven t used it to do good  even trump s charities have failed to give back as much as trump says they have considering she d already made so many false statements  conway decided to go for the gold when she trashed clinton and the democratic party  she said  i mean  this is not the democratic party that you and i grew up in  chris  it has gone so far to the left  i can t even reach my hand out and touch it  cuomo deserves an award for keeping a straight face through this  you can watch conway in action below featured image is a screenshot
