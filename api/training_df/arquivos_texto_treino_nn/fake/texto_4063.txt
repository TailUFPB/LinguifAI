donald trump is all about free speech  as long as it means that he can verbally abuse anyone who gets in his way without having to pay consequences  unfortunately  for trump  though  the media  whose job it is to vet presidential candidates  isn t always sympathetic to his verbal tirades and his twitterrhea  he wants to put a stop to that in an interview with miami s wfor  trump was asked by the reporter if it should be easier to sue media and whether the first amendment provides  too much protection  trump didn t specifically say  yes   but he did talk about england well in england they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong  our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it  and i think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong  i m a big believer tremendous believer of the freedom of the press  nobody believes it stronger than me but if they make terrible  terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people  i m not just talking about me i m talking anybody else then yes  i think you should have the ability to sue them here s the video let s recap that for a moment  trump says   if they make terrible  terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people  i m not just talking about me i m talking anybody else then yes  i think you should have the ability to sue them  we already have that system in place  trump literally described libel laws  unfortunately for him  though  public figures  especially those running for public office  have a much harder time winning a libel suit  although if a publication knowingly writes incorrect and damaging information  he can sue the problem for trump  though  is that the media hasn t lied about him  they quote him directly  which for a man who clearly can t control what comes out of his mouth  is a problem featured image via joe raedle getty images
