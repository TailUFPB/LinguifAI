since the reagan administration  americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money  republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation  while for the most part  democrats disagree  the compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping    million or more     million for married couples  are taxed  anything below that is completely tax free now  hillary clinton  after prodding from bernie sanders and his followers  has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when i say donald trump s children won t be happy previously  clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its  levels  pushing up the rate from  percent to  percent  and making it kick in for estates worth at least    million  today  it only hits those valued at    million or more   but  no longer  instead  she s borrowed a page from her formal primary rival  and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive tax meaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estates with a top rate of  percent  the last time the estate tax hit that level was in   though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances beyond all that  clinton has said she would largely do away with the step up in basis at death  a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that  say  their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away in the end  the committee expects these measures to raise about   billion over ten years source  slateas it stands  the estate tax system is a joke  in   a staggering    trillion was passed down as an inheritance  of that  less than  percent was taxed  as for the republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses  in   only  small businesses and family farm estates  in the entire country  had to pay estate taxes the other common republican argument is that estate taxes are  double taxation   as if every other dollar in the american economy hasn t been taxed multiple times   but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains  which are also unlikely to have every been taxed of course  even if clinton is elected  she ll have a tough time passing this  at least as long as paul ryan is in charge of the house  he wants trump s kids to pay zero in estate taxes  of course  for all we know  trump himself pays zero in taxes featured image via mark wilson getty images
