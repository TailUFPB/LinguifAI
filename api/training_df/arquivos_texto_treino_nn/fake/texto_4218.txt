on thursday morning  donald trump did the unthinkable  he canceled an interview with one of his biggest cheerleaders  sean hannity  trump had been scheduled to appear on the fox host s show thursday night  but a spokeswoman for the network says the donald will not be showing up this announcement comes in the wake of  pussygate    trump s mid  s admission that he loves that he can get away with grabbing women  by the pussy  because he s rich   as well as revelations that he barged into dressing rooms to creep on models  some as young as  years old   his admission that he thought paris hilton was hot when she was   audio of him hitting on a  year old surfacing  and his upcoming child rape case apparently mr  trump doesn t think even sean hannity   a joke of a man who has done nothing but pitch underhand to trump the entire election season  can find kid gloves to fit this situation things are not looking good for trump lately  with his poll numbers in a nosedive since everyone learned about his  special handshake   while it is gratifying to see the republican party and even some of trump s formerly vocal supporters running away from him  it is frightening that it is only happening now  the gop is fine with islamophobia  racism  his open courting of white supremacists  his constant attack on women because of their looks and weight  his desire to build a wall to keep brown people out of the country  muslim concentration camps  his incessant remarks about banging his daughter  the child rape allegations  and his love of well done steaks  at one point it seemed like trump was right when he said he could shoot someone and not lose a single supporter apparently  groping was the line featured image via getty images joe raedle
