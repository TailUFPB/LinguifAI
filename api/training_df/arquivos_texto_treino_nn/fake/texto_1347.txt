in a stunning example of just how morally bankrupt right wing media has become in the age of trump  breitbart   the conservative website often described as trump s de facto propaganda wing   wrote a lavish piece praising melania trump for her  high fashion  outfits while accompanying her husband on his first overseas trip who cares  right  why would anyone have a problem with what the first lady is wearing on a trip well  breitbart  the very same website  seems to   albeit only when it s the african american wife of america s first african american president  here s the sneering way they covered michelle obama s decision to wear a    dress on the former president s visit with the pope politico reports that first lady michelle obama  looking lovely and classy  greeted pope francis tuesday while wearing a    dress  while the obamas are not catholics  this is still a finger in the eye to a white house guest who frequently speaks out   to wild democrat applause   about the evils of excessive capitalism and adding to the absurd critique according to worldvision  you can feed a child for just    a month  michelle obama s dress would feed over  children for that month  this choice obviously is contrary to the values of pope francis  but the obamas  religious values come from elsewhere  a divisive and disturbing place  not a charitable or unifying one almost beyond parody flash forward to this weekend  melania was treated to a photo spread  with brietbart praising her outfits  including an expensive custom made creation from fashion designer dolce   gabbana in a visit to meet pope francis  melania worked with dolce   gabbana  again  on a stunning custom made  black coat dress that showed off a beautiful round collar  framing the first lady s face  the look was paired with a black lace mantilla and black manolo blahnik stilettos  sticking to the vatican dress code the next day  melania would don a dress that cost     conservatives didn t bat an eye let s crunch those numbers through breitbart s bullshit calculator according to worldvision  you can feed a child for just   a month  melania trump s dress would feed over  children for a month  but then the trump s religious values come from elsewhere  a divisive and disturbing place  not a charitable one   this comparison  however tongue in cheek  is actually unfair in more ways than one  the obamas actually do have a history of charitable giving  trump is famous for not donating to charity  a truly  divisive and disturbing  worldview  if there ever was one  as the above passages exemplify  breitbart loved to apply ridiculous  nonsense standards to the obamas that they would never dream of holding the trump family up to  the website once run by anti semite steve bannon and which has a section devoted to  black crime  has some pretty obvious  bigoted reasons for hating the obamas  it s egregious but not particularly surprising then that they would find the white first lady s opulence charming while finding the black first lady s show of class distressing featured image via franco origlia getty images   h t mikel jollett
