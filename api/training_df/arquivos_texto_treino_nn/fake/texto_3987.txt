james comey  the director of the federal bureau of investigation  is in hot water for sending a vague letter about some emails that were found on anthony weiner s computer  which he linked to democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton after saying months ago that the matter of hillary s private server was resolved  while it could be expected that democrats would be furious that comey would do such a thing just  days before what is easily the hottest national election cycle in recent memory  comey is getting pushback from unexpected sources as well  republicans judiciary chair chuck grassley  r iowa  had harsh words for comey  saying in part  via a letter  unfortunately  your letter failed to give congress and the american people enough context to evaluate the significance or full meaning of this development  without additional context  your disclosure is not fair to congress  the american people  or secretary clinton  grassley  of course  is far from the only person of influence who is troubled by comey s actions  despite his reputation as a man of integrity  people on both sides of the aisle regard friday s letter as a grave mistake  grassley s letter continued  in the absence of additional  authoritative information from the fbi in the wake of your vague disclosure  congress and the american people are left to sift through anonymous leaks from justice department officials to the press of varying levels of detail  reliability  and consistency  the american people deserve better than that  grassley is right  the only possible connection those emails have to hillary clinton is the fact that the computer they were found on was shared by her longtime aide  huma abedin  who  of course  is the estranged wife of anthony weiner  weiner  of course  is the disgraced former congressman being investigated for allegedly sexting with a minor  so  in other words  nothing to see here folks perhaps most startling of all was a tweet from former congressman joe walsh  who is now a right wing radio host known for being an avid trump supporter and is no stranger to controversy  including social media posts that could be interpreted as calls to violence  even walsh  however  had to admit that what comey did was flat out wrong hillary is corrupt as hell  but the fbi dir has no right to mess with an election he goes public cuz of emails no one has seen  just wrong  joe walsh   walshfreedom  october    the end of the day  the integrity of our elections are the bedrock of our democracy  that should always supersede politics  if director comey cannot understand and abide by that principle  he should resign immediately featured image via win mcnamee getty images
