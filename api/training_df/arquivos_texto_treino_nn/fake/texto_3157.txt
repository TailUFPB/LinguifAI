donald trump s tweets just became the club progressives like bernie sanders are going to use to hammer him with over the next four years it s no secret that trump is obsessed with spewing all kinds of bullshit on twitter  but they are a liability that will make republicans regret making trump their leader because messages on twitter can live forever  even if trump deletes them  there are likely always going to be copies that were captured via screenshot but bernie sanders didn t need to worry about that because trump rarely deletes his past tweets  which made things awkward for trump and the senate republicans as sanders took to the floor to passionately defend social security  medicare  and medicaid  all three of which republicans want to gut after trump takes office on january  throughout the primaries and the presidential campaign  trump told his supporters that he would not cut social security  medicare  or medicaid  most prominently  he repeated that message on twitter in may  to claim that mike huckabee copied him by saying the same thing  i was the first   only potential gop candidate to state there will be no cuts to social security  medicare   medicaid   trump wrote   huckabee copied me  well  during his time on the senate floor on wednesday  sanders used that very tweet against trump  even going so far as to blow it up for all to see  to demonstrate that if trump signs any legislation republicans send him to target these sacred programs  he would be breaking a core promise to the people who voted for him sanders began by calling out republicans for cruelly seeking to repeal obamacare  which would leave millions of americans without health insurance and increase the deficit by hundreds of millions of dollars he then slammed republicans for taking at a medicare in their budget bill  a move that would eliminate medicare as it currently exists  a government run program that actually works to provide senior citizens the healthcare they need at a far lower cost than a private insurance plan would provide sanders also repeated a statement trump made on april     every republican wants to do a big number on social security   trump said   they want to do it on medicare and they want to do it on medicaid and we can t do it  it s not fair to the people who have been paying in for years  in march  trump attacked paul ryan for planning to gut medicare  but trump made it clear that he doesn t support ryan s plan because it will cost republicans the election  millions of people voted for him on the belief that he would keep his word   sanders declared here s the video via youtube donald trump is already backing away from his promises  which means his supporters were duped in the worst way  they were stabbed in the back and now have to face a future where medicare  social security  medicaid  and obamacare do not exist  and they only have themselves to blame for believing trump in the first place featured image via screenshot
