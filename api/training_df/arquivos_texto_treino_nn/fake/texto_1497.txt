despite promising to release his tax returns all throughout his presidential campaign  donald trump still refuses to make good on his promise to concerned americans  instead  he s gotten his lawyers to make a statement about the last ten years of his tax returns  and it went pretty much exactly how we thought it would   it was a disaster raising more questions than they actually answered  trump s lawyers told reporters that trump s tax returns don t reflect any income of any type from russian sources   however there are  a few exceptions  according to the associated press  trump s lawyers sent a letter stating that the dishonest  shady potus didn t owe any money to russian lenders and had no equity investment by russians in entities controlled by trump   of course  these lawyers didn t provide any copies of the tax returns to verify this  so it s very possible that this information is false  however  the letter did state that trump received  income from the  miss universe pageant held in moscow and a property sold to a russian billionaire in  for   million  anyone with a decent brain can see how shady and weird this whole situation is  and it wasn t long before twitter latched on to the statement  with a few exceptions  and made the hashtag   withfewexceptions  go viral  people didn t hesitate to drag trump and his lawyers for their disgraceful scheme to clear his name  even though they ve clearly stated that he s guilty as hell here are some of the best reactions        we could not have said it better  the lengths that trump and his team have gone to continue hiding what is in his tax returns should be cause for alarm  not to mention  trump s erratic behavior whenever russia is mentioned  something shady is definitely going on  and no one should believe anything that comes out of the mouth of trump  his administration  or anyone he hires featured image via mario tama   getty images
