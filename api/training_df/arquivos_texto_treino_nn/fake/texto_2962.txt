before running the most controversial and bombastic political campaign in recent presidential history  donald trump was perhaps best known for plastering his name  preferably plated in gold  across absolutely everything he could   especially on very tall phallic symbols  he might not be as proud of his latest namesake  though  it s a moth and it s known for its weird  hair  and its tiny genitalia image via twitter this centimeter wide moth was identified by evolutionary biologist and lepidopterist vazrick nazari  who announced the find in a paper published tuesday in the open access journal zookeys  nazari settled on the name n  donaldtrumpi because the silky yellow white scales these moths develop on their heads in adulthood reminded him of the president elect s signature hairdo by meticulously examining specimens of the moth and its close relatives  nazari was able to catalogue its unique anatomy  including its male genitalia  which is  comparatively smaller  than the moth s close relative neopalpa neonata  according to the study source  motherboardoh  but it gets worse for the president elect  the moth is native to trump s nemesis state of california  and into mexico  did i mention that it has really tiny genitals  well  it s worth mentioning again the moth is also known as a twirler moth  and like the man it s named from  it exhibits unexplainable bursts of frantic behavior  if it had hands  it would probably be tweeting weird vendettas at   am as well naming the moth after trump wasn t just a silly jab at the thin skinned man baby about to occupy the oval office  it was a pretty clever attempt at bringing attention to the moth and to the environment  by naming this species after the  president of the united states  i hope to bring some public attention to  and interest in  the importance of alpha taxonomy in better understanding the neglected micro fauna component of the north american biodiversity  the timing couldn t be better  republicans are already set to roll back parts of the endangered species act dr  peter oboyski  manager and curator of the essig museum of entomology at university of california  berkeley  hopes that this finding will help bring attention to all species of moths  most of which we may never discover  before they go extinct  as for trump  dr  oboyski said hopefully our new president will take pride in having a species named for him  recognize the enormous task set before biologists and encourage his administration to support research to discover and describe the overwhelming biodiversity all around us while it is still there let s hope featured image via christopher furlong getty images
