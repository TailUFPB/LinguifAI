donald trump just sank to a new embarrassing low on the world stage sitting presidents usually do not attack their predecessors  especially during visits to other nations  and especially not in nations where the predecessor is popular such as the case in poland  where president obama is respected and supported but trump launched an attack on president obama anyway during a press conference alongside polish president duda on wednesday that included a whole lot of lies and a suggestion that obama committed treason after being asked to  definitively  admit that russia meddled with the  election  trump teeter tottered before blaming president obama and claimed obama knew about russian interference and  did nothing  i think it was russia and i think it could have been a lot of people interfered   trump said   i said it very simply  i think it could very well have been russia  but i think it well could have been other countries  and i won t be specific  but i think a lot of people interfere  why did he  do nothing about it   trump continued   he was told it was russia by the cia as i understand it  it was well reported and he did nothing about it  i think it s been happening for a long time  it s been happening for many years  now  the thing i have to mention is that barack obama when he was president found out about this in terms of if it were russia  found out about it in august  now  the election was in november  that s a lot of time  he did nothing about it  here s the video via youtube in fact  president obama did warn russia in september to cease their hacking activities  russia didn t obey and president obama slapped sanctions against them in retaliation  also  there was not a lot obama could do since trump was out there claiming that the election is  rigged   had obama stopped russia from helping trump win  trump would have accused obama of rigging the election against him if trump is so confident that president obama is to blame for russian interference  why is he trying so hard to sabotage the russia investigation once again  america becomes even more of a laughingstock around the globe because trump refuses to keep his mouth shut and remain civil in public featured image  screenshot
