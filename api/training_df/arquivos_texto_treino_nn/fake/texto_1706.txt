donald trump s media mouthpiece  fox news  is trying to put a positive spin on his terrible first  days  just like reince priebus and trump himself  part of what fox is doing seems to be taking to twitter to loudly complain about how the rest of the media has covered his first  days  needless to say  they are very unhappy that the media s coverage has been overwhelmingly negative  to them  this demonstrates a very obvious hatred of trump the media s  day war against  potus  pic twitter com orctyetvzt  fox news   foxnews  april       of broadcast news coverage of the trump administration has been negative  pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  april    news pushed relentlessly negative agenda  pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  april    this is because it s trump  fox news was similarly negative during obama s first  days  according to george mason university s center for media affairs  bret baier s  special report  only gave positive coverage to obama  percent of the time  they analyzed  special report  because it most closely resembles traditional broadcast news    percent of their coverage was negative overall  only  percent of fox s total coverage was positive  and that number dropped to  percent when discussing his policies perhaps more than that  though  is the fact that fox declared their opposition to obama as quickly as they could  in april of   they were openly urging their viewers to get involved in tea party protests against president obama s fiscal policy furthermore  they weren t afraid to use words like socialism  fascism  marxism and even communism  they uttered those words   times during obama s first  days  or  times per day so really  where do they get off whining about how the media s covering trump  the fact of the matter is that trump has actually been a complete disaster since he got elected  his proposals are literally impossible  he thought he could strongarm both congress and hostile world leaders into falling in line behind him  and he s spent more time golfing in his first  days than obama spent in his entire first year  calling all this out is part of the media s job photo of donald trump by mark wilson getty images  photo of president obama by kevin dietsch pool getty images
