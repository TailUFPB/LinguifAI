vermont senator bernie sanders is in full campaign mode  and it shows  he s also having a high old time trolling house speaker paul ryan  who is under a seemingly crippling amount of stress due to his own party s buffoonish nominee  donald trump earlier in the week  ryan spoke to a group of young republicans in his home state of wisconsin  and had dire warnings regarding what could happen if democrats take back the senate  that their worst nightmare would come true  and bernie would be heading up the budget committee  ryan said to the university of wisconsin students  if we lose the senate  do you know who becomes the chairman of the senate budget committee  a guy named bernie sanders  you ever heard of him  ryan s remarks were not missed by bernie  he tweeted  i heard what  speakerryan said  if the gop loses the senate  i ll be the budget chairman  sounds like a good idea  here is the tweet i heard what  speakerryan said  if the gop loses the senate  i ll be the budget chairman  sounds like a good idea  https   t co   bernie sanders   berniesanders  october    from the obvious trolling  the best thing about the tweet is that it links to an opportunity to donate to democratic candidates for the united states senate  this is entirely possible  since democrats only need to pick up five seats to take the senate   four if we take the white house  since the vice president is the tie breaker in votes hopefully  donald trump continues to tear the gop apart  and paul ryan s warning becomes a glorious reality for democrats and assorted left wingers everywhere featured image via darren mccollester getty images
