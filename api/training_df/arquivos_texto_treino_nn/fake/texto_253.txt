donald trump kicked off hispanic heritage month on friday during an event at the white house  he did this after his thoroughly embarrassing tour of hurricane devastated puerto rico in which he lobbed rolls of paper towels at victims of the hurricane and that was after he blamed the island for the natural disaster  puerto ricans are very proud people  but trump tried to diminish them trump spoke on different topics during his speech  from the economy to the las vegas massacre  then he addressed puerto rico which is now in crisis after hurricanes maria and irma devasted the u s  territory  we are also praying for the people of puerto rico   trump said while using an exaggerated spanish accent  we love puerrrrtoooo ricooo   he continued  again with the accent   puerto rico   he said again at that point  a woman yelled out    we love you   and trump then said  and we also love puerto rico   but this time  the fake president dropped his fake accent watch trump says puerto rico in an affected spanish accent three times in a row   via cbs  pic twitter com fopavnlqay  kyle griffin     october     the audience laughed because haha  we re used to this  president  offending every single group of americans across the board  perhaps a better way of honoring puerto ricans would be to not try to cover up his own misdeeds in handling the humanitarian crisis  on oct    half of the residents in puerto rico had access to clean water and  percent of the island had electricity  according to the federal emergency management agency website  however  by oct    fema had removed statistics on puerto rico s water and power supply from its website  so now we have no idea of what the island is dealing with and what they need to survive  the only thing fema left on its site was good news  not the real news which is very bleak information on water access and electricity on the island is available only on a website maintained by the office of gov  rossell   statuspr  according to the website    percent of the island has power and   percent of people have some form of drinking water but trump says he  loves  puerto ricans as he mocks their accent image via screen capture
