last year  trump claimed he was succeeding at saving manufacturing jobs by making individual deals with individual companies  like carrier in indiana  at the time  people pointed out that he was boasting about the carrier deal while totally ignoring another indiana company  rexnord  that was likewise shipping its jobs to mexico and now  rexnord has done so  nbc news did a report on the plant s closure  which trump must have watched because he felt the need to lay the blame for this on obama shortly after it aired rexnord of indiana made a deal during the obama administration to move to mexico  fired their employees  tax product big that s sold in u s   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    funny thing is that if he hadn t been bragging about how great he was at saving manufacturing jobs the instant he won the election  and threatening companies who were trying to outsource  he might actually have a case to make  but he promised to save these kinds of jobs and implied that he would do it company by company if he had to all he did with rexnord was tweet at them  which did nothing to sway their decision  and their employees feel as though trump failed them  as one employee said  in the long run  he s done forgot about us  cause he s moved on to bigger and better things  perhaps this little plant was just too little for trump to bother with  the move will save rexnord tens of millions of dollars  because they can pay mexican workers   per hour vs  the   per hour they were paying their american workers  regardless  this is what trump said back in december  shortly after claiming victory with both ford and carrier rexnord of indiana is moving to mexico and rather viciously firing all of its  workers  this is happening all over our country  no more   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    our knowledge  trump never even tried to save these jobs despite calling this company out and threatening them with huge tariffs should they actually do this  this is on his head  not obama s  you can t brag about how you ll save all these jobs and then blame your predecessor when it doesn t happen watch nbc news  report below featured image by olivier douliery pool via getty images
