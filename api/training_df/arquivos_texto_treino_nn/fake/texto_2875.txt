many people have long suspected that trump is abusive  if for no other reason than he s outwardly abusive to so many people  his twitter feed alone is rife with abuse  he seems to take pleasure in hurting people  and that appears to include his family  because abusers abuse everyone in one form or another during his inauguration  as he stood facing melania  he apparently said something extremely hurtful to her  she s smiling and  if you look at his cheeks  he seems to be smiling too  and then suddenly  his smile disappears and he turns pointedly away from her  you can see from the change in her expression that whatever he said just crushed her watch below wouldn t he want the world to see how happy the two of them are  even if it is a fa ade  what could she have possibly done to warrant this  anyway  say she really did do something worthy of rebuke   he could have  and should have  waited until they were alone to say something to her  the way he did it wasn t just crushing to her  it was probably also humiliating for her that wasn t the only time he was demeaning  either  when he greeted the obamas prior to his inauguration  he left her behind in the car  and then left her behind again to walk into the white house  it was president obama and michelle who actually escorted melania inside but that s where trump gets satisfaction   in shaming and humiliating people as much as possible for even the slightest transgressions  typical emotionally abusive behavior  some may say she knew what she was getting into when she got involved with him  but that s victim blaming  and it comes from those who don t get it it s extremely unlikely melania deserved whatever he said to her  or his self satisfied  deliberately supercilious manner when he turned his back on her featured image by kevin dietsch via getty images
