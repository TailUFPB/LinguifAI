amid allegations of russian interference with our elections  republicans are scrambling  trying to defend the leader of their party  the latest defense  which comes from lindsey graham and sort of from paul ryan  is that trump is too stupid to collude with the russians after former fbi director james comey testified in front of congress  that yes  trump did ask him to drop the investigation into former national security advisor michael flynn  the best defense house speaker paul ryan could come up with was that trump is new at this  he simply didn t know it wasn t cool to pressure the head of the fbi  the president s new at this  he s new to government  so  he probably wasn t steeped in the long running protocols that establish the relationships between doj  fbi and white houses  he s just new to this  pushed further by cnn  ryan said   i m not saying it s an acceptable excuse  it s just my observation  he s new at government  and so therefore i think that he   he is learning as he goes   ryan said source  cnnteenagers  try that argument next time you get pulled over while driving  on second thought  don t now  sen  lindsey graham has taken that argument a step further and said that trump is too incompetent to have colluded with the russians  he doesn t believe he did anything wrong with the russians and i tend to believe him   graham said on cbs  face the nation   he can t collude with his own government  why do you think he is colluding with the russians  source  think progresswhat graham is ignoring is that the fact that trump is incompetent is likely what made him the most desirable for russians  russian journalist mikhail fishman says this about russian president vladimir putin s opinion on trump they re quite obviously playing trump  they consider him a stupid  unstrategic politician  putin is confident that he can manipulate trump to his advantage  and he should be in other words  trump s a useful idiot to them exactly  the kremlin is limited in their knowledge about what s going on in washington  but they see the chaos and the confusion in trump s administration  they see the clumsiness  the inexperience  naturally  they re working to exploit that of course  graham and ryan know this and that s what s most dangerous of all  while trump might be too stupid to know that he is a stooge  the republican party s cavalier attitude about the fact that russia might have installed our incompetent commander in chief is perhaps the most treasonous part of all of this
