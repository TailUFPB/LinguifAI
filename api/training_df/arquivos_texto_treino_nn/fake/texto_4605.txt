president  zero f cks left  obama strikes again donald trump addressed his leading role in the birther conspiracy regarding president obama s birth certificate on friday  but president obama isn t impressed on thursday  the republican nominee refused yet again to answer whether he believes that president obama was born in hawaii  telling the washington post   i ll answer that question at the right time  i just don t want to answer it yet  following the interview  trump s campaign issued a disgusting statement making donald trump look like a hero while painting hillary clinton as the villain in the story  in   mr  trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling president obama to release his birth certificate  mr  trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that hillary clinton and her team first raised  the problem is that hillary and her campaign had nothing to do with the birther conspiracy  as politifact pointed out when it debunked trump s claim last year  it was a mere volunteer who started the conspiracy via email  no campaign official  nor hillary clinton herself  ever questioned president obama s citizenship donald trump  however  engaged in a vicious racist witch hunt over president obama s birth certificate  trump constantly claimed that president obama was not an american and that he was born in kenya  of course  trump was utterly humiliated by president obama when he released his full birth certificate to the public for all to see  even though he did not have to do so but trump has refused to personally acknowledge that president obama is the legitimate commander in chief and has never apologized for his attacks on friday  trump finally acknowledged that president obama was born in america  but still didn t apologize  president barack obama was born in the united states   trump said before adding   period  but it doesn t matter what trump says because president obama doesn t give a damn about what trump has to say when asked about trump s upcoming announcement prior  president obama slammed trump and his birtherism  i m shocked that a question like that would come up at a time when we ve got so many other things to do   well  i m not that shocked actually  it s fairly typical  we got other business to attend to  i was pretty confident about where i was born  i think most people were as well an my hope would be that the presidential election reflects more serious issues than that  here s the video via twitter obama   i was pretty confident about where i was born  i think most people were as well   https   t co  https   t co hclwvwzyzw  cnn   cnn  september    s not enough for donald trump to acknowledge the truth  he needs to man up and apologize for leading a persecution effort that did much damage and divided this country  especially if he wants any african americans to even consider voting for him in november featured image via pete souza white house
