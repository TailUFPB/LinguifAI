it s official  donald trump is literally trying to murder the american people as humans  we need clean air and clean water to survive as a species  without them  we would suffocate or die of thirst  crops and livestock also require clean water and clean air to produce our food supply this is basic stuff  but donald trump doesn t care about the needs of human beings  he only cares about corporate greed and that greed is going to kill millions trump has already launched an all out assault on the environmental protection agency  which works every day fighting for clean water and clean air for the american people the agency has been ordered to freeze grants and contracts which has halted air and water quality tests but now trump is looking to chip away at the bedrock of what the epa exists to do according to vox jonathan swan of axios got a look at an  agency action  plan that trump s advisers have written up for the epa  among the initiatives they plan to target   clean air act greenhouse gas regulations for new  nsps  and existing  esps or the  clean power  plan  coal and natural gas power plants    standards   clean water section   waters of the u s  rule  wetlands    tmdl  total maximum daily load  for chesapeake bay  by attacking the clean air and clean water acts  trump would be sentencing america to a deadly polluted future the likes of which have not been seen since the epa was created americans look at beijing in horror as china allows the air in that city to be so thick and poisonous that people need to wear gas masks every day if they go outside here s an image of new york in  before the epa aggressively fought for air standards via the national archives and here s one of los angeles if trump has his way  american cities will once again be choked by smog and our air quality with significantly decrease  one wonders if trump has investments in gas mask companies fresh water has also been a worry among millions of americans over the years as republicans continue to make decisions that allow companies like koch industries to pollute our waterways  trump s executive order to let the keystone xl pipeline move forward is a direct threat to the ogallala aquifer  which provides water to millions of americans in the midwest and is responsible for creating what is now called  america s breadbasket  the washington post reports in some places the aquifer is buried   feet deep  but in many places it is at or very close to the surface  often less than five feet below ground that s where concerns about the keystone xl came in  its original route traversed  miles of the sand hills and the ogallala  transcanada  which said it would bury the pipeline at least four feet underground  could in many places be putting it in water transcanada submitted a revised route to the state department  bypassing the sand hills but still passing over some parts of the aquifer should a massive oil spill occur  it could seep into the aquifer and poison it  and that would be a disaster even bigger than the lead poisoned water in flint  michigan because it would literally affect every american across the country and these spills can contaminate water for decades  the reason why flint s water supply was tainted with lead is because republicans decided to save money by switching the city s water from lake huron to the flint river  which was contaminated by lead decades ago  which is why flint got it s water from lake huron  this is public knowledge  but republicans ignored that and switched anyway trump also wants to expedite oil and gas permits and open up pristine natural lands to fracking and mining  which threatens habitats and our water supply  as we should all know  fracking has already poisoned water supplies in places around the country  some people can even light their water on fire because of the chemicals fracking companies use  that will increase under trump republicans now control congress  so they will likely help trump weaken the clean water and clean air acts no matter how much the american people protest so by letting trump and the republicans remain in office we are letting them kill us  literally featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
