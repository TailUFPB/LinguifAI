economists  even conservative ones  have severe problems with trump s economic policies  they re unrealistic  and he doesn t know what he s talking about according to both liberal and conservative economists  trump has made a point of not listening to the experts  but the experts know what they re talking about far better than trump ever will stan veuger  from the conservative american enterprise institute  was very forthright in his opinion of trump s ahem economic policy  he doesn t really know what he s talking about  and his policy platform is so incoherent that he has to make claims like that  it sounds like veuger thinks trump is making grandiose promises specifically to cover up the fact that he doesn t have a sane economic plan  knowing trump  that s exactly what he s doing  it also sounds like veuger finds it frustrating that trump won t listen to any experts mark zandi  chief economist at moody s analytics  and someone both trump and hillary have claimed is batting for  the other team   gave the hill his own summary of his analysis of trump s plan  saying  his growth expectations are not realistic  the economy s potential growth is  percent  and to get stronger growth will require immigration reform that provides a path to legalization for the undocumented and a significant increase in skilled legal immigration  he is strongly opposed to this  trump has bragged that he can increase our gdp from its current   percent to    or even  percent  which is just flat ridiculous  he s also adamantly opposed to giving undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship and  in fact  wants to create a deportation force to get rid of them  he thinks that will open up jobs for americans and get our economy booming again  but that s a pipe dream his strong nationalism has made him opposed to allowing more immigrants in  even legally  he believes they ll take americans  jobs  and he s afraid they could be dangerous  too trump believes that the economic growth he s promising will pay for the tax cuts he s promising  but it won t happen that way  zandi says that these plans will cripple the economy and federal revenue  of course  trump won t listen  because reasons  what s clear  though  is that the experts who know better than trump are growing bolder in trashing his concept of economics featured image by spencer platt via getty images
