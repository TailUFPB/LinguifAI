we all know the feeling of dread that takes over when you see someone in public that you would really rather avoid  that frantic moment when you look around for somewhere  anywhere  to hide  well  apparently former fbi director james comey felt that way about donald trump  not that you can blame him the new york times reports that comey was once so desperate to avoid dealing with trump that he tried to blend in with the curtains to avoid him  make no mistake  comey is not a little guy  he stands    tall  so he tends to stand out  but brookings institution fellow benjamin wittes said that comey was hoping that if he stood close enough to the dark blue curtains of the white house blue room in his suit  that was an almost perfect match   maybe he could go unnoticed  he thought he had gotten through and not been noticed or singled out and that he was going to get away without an individual interaction   wittes told the times but no such luck  trump spotted comey and made a big production out of it  he called comey out of the curtains  noting that he had become  more famous  that himself and then proceeded to hug comey   against his will comey said that as he was walking across the room he was determined that there wasn t going to be a hug   wittes said   it was bad enough there was going to be a handshake  and comey has long arms so comey said he pre emptively reached out for a handshake and grabbed the president s hand  but trump pulled him into an embrace and comey didn t reciprocate  if you look at the video  it s one person shaking hands and another hugging  lucky for us  this classic moment was caught on video  featured image via joe raedle getty images
