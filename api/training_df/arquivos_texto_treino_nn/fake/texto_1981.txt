when donald trump fails  his team sure doesn t help make it any better on monday  white house press secretary sean spicer decided to pour salt in the gaping wound that was left when trump and the gop suffered a massive failure in gaining approval for their disastrous plan to repeal and replace obamacare  the american health care act  also known as trumpcare  not only failed to get enough votes  but trump pulled it from the house floor because it was such an obvious  humiliating defeat in speaking to reporters during his daily briefing  spicer likened trumpcare to a  bad deal    which was a pretty odd thing to say  considering how much trump has bragged about what a good negotiator and dealmaker he is  to diss something that trump supported full heartedly is definitely not going to make trump happy  spicer said  the president also recognizes that when there s not a deal to be made  when to walk away  it s not just about making deals  it s knowing when to walk away from deals and knowing  when there s a bad deal  that s the only solution  i think the president understood that where we were  that while you can get a deal at the time  that sometimes a bad deal is worse than getting a deal  and i think he smartly recognized that what was on the table was not going to be keeping with the vision that he had  and so he decided that this was not the time and that a deal was not at hand  really  who needs critics when you have spicer  it should also be noted that even after the bill failed  trump was still praising the gop s awful plan  stating that it just needed some improvement  yet spicer pretty much trashed trumpcare  and said that the gop s plan to do away with obamacare  which they ve been bragging about for the last seven years  was a devastating fail  looks like trump really doesn t have a talent for making deals after all featured image via ninian reid   flickr
