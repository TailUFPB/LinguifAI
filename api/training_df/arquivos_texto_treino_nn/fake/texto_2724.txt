donald trump s screaming banshee kellyanne conway went on fox news to whine about democrats on thursday morning and failed to recognize the hypocrisy throughout   senate republicans blocked president obama s nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court despite the fact that garland was a qualified judge who previously received praise and support from the gop  garland is considered a moderate jurist who would have sat at the ideological center of the high court in a completely unprecedented move  republicans refused to even give garland a confirmation hearing and left the supreme court one member short on the bench out of petty hatred of president obama on tuesday  donald trump chose conservative judge neil gorsuch for the supreme court  in response  democrats have vowed to retaliate against republicans by blocking trump s nominee  republicans  however  are now whining because democrats are treating trump s nominee the same way republicans treated obama s mitch mcconnell has repeatedly complained about democratic obstruction of trump s nominees  conveniently ignoring his own party s obstruction of president obama for eight years  obstruction that he personally ordered and now kellyanne conway is whining about democratic obstruction as well during an appearance on fox   friends  conway called democrats  a bunch of crybabies who say they are going to oppose supreme court nominees before they even know the person s name and his academic credentials and impeccable judicial record  that sounds a whole lot like what republicans did last february while justice scalia s dead body wasn t even cold yet  obama picked garland a few months later and his academic credentials and judicial record were even more impressive than gorsuch s  this obstinance and obstruction is the modern democratic party   conway cntinued  again failing to recognize the hypocrisy of her claims   i think it s going to cost them because they re hysterical about everything now  there s no gradation of hysteria  everything makes them cry and scream  here s the video via youtube seriously  do republicans really think the american people are stupid  for nearly an entire year  republicans acted like petulant children by refusing to even grant garland a hearing  yet they are bitching about democrats for blocking trump s nominee republicans are hypocrites and they only have themselves to blame for creating a new precedent when it comes to supreme court picks  they were the ones who blocked president obama s rightful pick for a year  they literally stole a supreme court seat from president obama  who was the legally elected sitting president at the time  and it should be pointed out that president obama s election victories were bigger than trump s by a wide margin  until republicans give garland the fair hearing he deserves  democrats should block trump s nominees indefinitely  it s nothing less than what republicans deserve  they started it  now they get to reap what they sowed  turnabout is fair play featured image via screenshot
