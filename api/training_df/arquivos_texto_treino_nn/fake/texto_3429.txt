it s finally over  now that donald trump has been kinda sorta elected president by a historic minority of voters and a system put in place thanks to lobbying by slave owners  republicans have decided that a headline grabbing fake investigation into hillary clinton just isn t necessary anymore in multiple desperate attempts to blame the tragic benghazi terrorist attacks on hillary clinton and barack obama  republicans spent years betraying taxpayers by knowingly wasting millions of their dollars doing their best not to uncover the truth  but to turn public perception against the president and the former secretary of state  principled  conservatives and other stupid people rallied around the cause as trump and stein supporters  unable to tell fact from fiction  used benghazi and any other fake scandal they heard about on infowars to demand that clinton be jailed or even executed for imagined crimes yes  it was propaganda   it was effective taxpayer funded propaganda  but it s over now  trump will be our next president  the committee has lost interest  and  most importantly    the truth of the millions of dollars worth of investigations is laid bare  it was all an effort to hoodwink voters  every  single  bit  of  it while the panel s chairman  trey gowdy  loudly trumpeted every facet of this witch hunt at every step of the way  the final report was added to the official house record without so much as a peep from him  the reason  he d accomplished his purpose  there s no longer any need for him to abuse his position to play politics now that the game he was playing is over  usa today has a nice rundown of the damage that was done the special committee was created in may  to investigate the terrorist attacks at the u s  compound in eastern libya where four americans died  including ambassador christopher stevens in june  the benghazi committee report was endorsed by the republican committee members but not the democrats  it severely criticized military  cia and obama administration officials for their response as the attacks unfolded and their subsequent explanations to the american people  it accused the government of incompetence at various levels  including a failure to deploy needed military assets  cia intelligence reports that were  rife with errors   and misguided planning even in the midst of the violence  the report did not single out wrongdoing by then secretary of state hillary clinton  although some republicans on the panel alleged that overall concern for her political future influenced and hampered some of the decision making surrounding policy in libya clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state was revealed as part of the benghazi investigation  but the committee did not investigate whether the setup led to improper handling of classified information  the fbi declined to pursue criminal charges regarding the email system  but it was a major issue in the  presidential election gowdy on monday called the report the  final  definitive accounting  of the benghazi attacks  the committee is proud to have been able to tell the story of the ingenuity and bravery displayed by our nation s heroes in benghazi  who banded together to save one another when no other help was ever on the way   gowdy said when asked about the report  but rep  elijah cummings  the panel s batman to gowdy s aryan joker  was quick to call it what it was  republicans voted on this partisan report five months ago  but delayed filing it and completing the committee until after the election   cummings says   republicans promised a process that was fair and bipartisan  but the american people got exactly the opposite  if any republican mentions any aspect of the benghazi investigation to you ever again  be sure to point out that conservative  principles  only exist long enough for them to work to someone s political benefit  then they just disappear like this investigation did after trump  won  and ebola after the midterms featured image via getty images mark wilson
