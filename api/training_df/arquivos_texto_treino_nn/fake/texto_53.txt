just in case you needed any more proof that donald trump s racist tweets were a thinly coded message to his alt right  anti muslim  and white supremacist followers  a former grand wizard of the kkk has jumped on board today in praise of president hates a lot it wasn t enough that the kkk endorsed trump during his campaign to stop his multitudes of followers from voting for him  so it s hard to say whether duke s full throated endorsement of today s disgusting display of racism will be any different  but for the average american  seeing the former klan leader get behind trump so vigorously should make them more than a little sick to even go to duke s page on twitter is to subject yourself to a blinding cover photo  all white  with a blue eyed  aryan  baby in the upper corner  and the words  it s okay to be white  across the middle  the phrase is part of a hate campaign that  doctor  duke has been pushing across america  a play on the notion that there is some kind of war on white people happening but the tweet itself is disturbing trump retweets video of crippled white kid in europe being beaten by migrants  and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death  he s condemned for showing us what the fake news media won t  thank god for trump  that s why we love him   david duke   drdavidduke  november    invoking god in his message  duke is trying the age old tactic of pretending that white supremacy has its roots in christianity  an angle that kkk members have tried to use for generations sadly  it works on some followers of both duke s and of donald trump s  it seems there s quite a bit of crossover between the two racist groups  that s no surprise  the kkk were absolutely instrumental in getting trump elected the bottom line is  both men know exactly what they re doing when they send messages like that to their followers  trump s racist retweets were already disgraceful enough  but continuing to leave them on his twitter feed even after seeing praise from a loyal white knight like david duke is just rubbing salt in the wound featured image via william thomas cain getty images
