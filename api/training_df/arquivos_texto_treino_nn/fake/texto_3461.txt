throughout his campaign  trump repeatedly told anyone he could brainwash that the u s  doesn t win at anything anymore  supposedly  we used to be the perennial powerhouse of the entire world  like duke  north carolina or arizona are perennial powerhouses of ncaa basketball   but we ve fallen from that status  and now we don t win anything like the number of games we used to in other words  we used to be able to tell the world what they would do  and they would do it  now they don t  so trump promised our working class that he would change that  and bring their jobs back  and make us so prosperous that those jobs would never disappear again and everyone would be begging to trade with us so they could have a tiny slice of our awesomeness whether trump actually knows the truth or not is anyone s guess  he s too focused on  winning   and he s told our suffering working class particularly blue collar workers whose jobs are disappearing that the reason their jobs are gone is because we ve given too much to countries that don t deserve our largesse or whatever  he s convinced half the country that the  percent tariff he wants on imported goods from china  and the  percent tariff on goods from mexico  will keep companies from outsourcing manufacturing and the people who bought that are the ones who will hurt the worst from trump s actual trade policies the economist pointed this massive problem with trump s rhetoric out with a single chart  we have free trade agreements not just with two countries  but with   those  countries represent a third of our imported goods  yes  but they also represent half of our exported goods image via the economistexport is one of the major drivers of our economy  and our dear mr  trump conveniently forgets that part of the equation when he rails against china  mexico  and everyone else in the chart above  the dark blue  on both sides  represents our trade due to nafta  we do an awful lot of exports to both mexico and canada  in addition to imports  it s not quite equal  but it s also not so disparate that we re at the horrible disadvantage that trump claims we are with nafta  millions of american jobs actually depend heavily on nafta remaining intact as far as china  yeah  we seem to be at a big disadvantage  however  it actually balances out pretty well when we factor in our trade with other countries  china isn t raping us the way that trump claims they are in short  when you look at imports versus exports  we re not getting robbed at nearly the rate that trump would have us believe  to listen to him talk  we only import foreign goods and we export nothing  if that were true  then yes  our trade agreements would be destroying american jobs the way he claims  the problem with that attitude  though  is not only that it s false  but it also shows that trump s protectionist policies will destroy american exports and thus  american jobs that  in turn  will further destroy the american working class   the very class that believes trump will save them  their jobs  and their dignity from the evil  horrible  liberal democrats that want to assassinate them  we wish these people knew how to look at this  but they don t  they re virtually killing themselves in their blindly staunch defense of trump because they either can t  or won t  educate themselves education is for liberal elites anyway  so they shun it do we import more than we export  yes  but imagine if some countries decided to stop accepting our products in retaliation for our not accepting theirs without a huge penalty attached  our exports would fall off drastically  and thousands more americans would lose their jobs  even with trump s one by one coercion of companies looking to outsource seriously  trump does not seem to understand any of this  we have a fucking president who doesn t get this and won t listen to the people who do because he thinks he s this amazing business genius and everyone else is just jealous  or something he doesn t have to listen to anyone because he already knows everything  in other words if he starts a trade war  which is what his trade policies would do should they actually be implemented  the working class he s claiming to protect will die an even more horribly painful death as countries retaliate against us for our unfair trade tactics the global economy is far more complex than trump and his idiotic  entitled  hypocritical  privileged  rich family and friends understand  we can t just implement protectionist policies  bring back those millions of lost manufacturing jobs  and give the world the finger  it does not work that way  it will never again work that way  here s hoping that congress can understand how he ll destroy us on trade and refuse to put it into action featured image by drew angerer via getty images
