trump s attorney general jeff sessions is as furious as trump is over the blocking of an executive order that would have denied muslims entry into the united states  rather than reassess their own morality  the islamophobic tag team has gone after the judges who have pointed out their plans are unconstitutional  for trump  a former reality tv star and current  year old fox news viewer  the inability to understand the basics of america s justice system is pretty much a given  but his attorney general seems just as clueless   and it s literally his job to understand the law highlighting his sheer incompetence to perform the job he was handpicked to do  sessions  formerly an alabama senator best known for being a racist  slammed the state of hawaii and discounted its importance in the united states with a shocking rant during an interview with right wing conspiracy theorist mark levin  we ve got cases moving in the very  very liberal ninth circuit  who  they ve been hostile to the order   sessions said   we won a case in virginia recently that was a nicely written order that just demolished  i thought  all the arguments that some of the other people have been making  we are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the supreme court  if not the ninth circuit  so this is a huge matter  i really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the united states from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power  that judge  sitting on an island in the pacific  sessions was so quick to dismiss  he s a federal judge working in a federal court in the u s  state of hawaii  hardly a random nobody as ever  the trump administration s go to defense of their badly botched policies is to attack the critics for not letting them do whatever they want  trump s so called  travel ban  would have overtly banned many muslims from entering the united states based exclusively on their religion and ethnicity  the constitution is pretty clear on that  the ruling was so straightforward that it was actually confirmed by several other federal judges before trump announced that he was dropping his stab at it and starting over and given sessions  track record  it is a bit more odious that he would choose to go after the  island in the pacific  populated by a diverse group of americans  racist dog whistles aren t supposed to be this loud update  as reporters have pointed out  sessions  smear on judge derrick watson is even more obviously partisan because he actually voted for him fyi jeff sessions voted to confirm derrick watson  the federal judge he s now attacking as  a judge sitting on an island in the pacific   pic twitter com   kyle griffin     april    image via mark wilson getty images
