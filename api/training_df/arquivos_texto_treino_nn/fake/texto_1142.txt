in the wake of a mass shooting that left a republican member of congress and several others injured  many on both sides of the aisle are asking that the partisan rhetoric on both sides cool down a bit  it s an admirable goal and one worth reaching for  however  it s also worth noting that the very same republicans now suggesting liberals are inciting violence don t seem to have the same concerns about their own side the calls to  cool down partisan rhetoric   ironic as it may be  seem to be entirely partisan  one side   and it rhymes with treepublicans   aren t pulling their weight  the story unfolds each time this happens like clockwork  liberals join with conservatives in condemning hate on both sides  conservatives fall silent when right wing extremists go on violent rampages  repeatedly failing to police their own a prime example of this disconnect is sen  rand paul  he was at the baseball practice when shots began to ring out  he was unharmed  but experienced the horror  however  his understandable desire to condemn political violence is not reflected in his twitter history  just last year  while a democrat was still president and during the deeply heated election  he passed along a message of encouraging political violence  quoting a fox news guest  paul wrote   judgenap  why do we have a second amendment  it s not to shoot deer  it s to shoot at the government when it becomes tyrannical   senator rand paul   randpaul  june     he never bothered to delete the tweet   we took screenshots in case he decides to now  the political climate of june  was  in some ways  even more heated than it is now  by that point in obama s presidency  it had become clear that the right s boogieman was not going to be impeached and that his two terms in office had been overwhelming successful  confronted with that reality  conservatives grew hysterical  even in the months before he left office  obama was being labeled by right wing media as  tyrannical  here s how the federalist  a so called  intellectual  right wing outlet  was describing obama just months before rand s tweet the year before  sen  ted cruz and texas governor greg abbott were seriously suggesting that obama might invade texas and enact a martial law program named  jade helm  to confiscate texans  guns  the allegations were patently absurd  but they riled up many conservatives who suddenly became terrified that the government was about to round them up and put them in detention camps   trump s friend alex jones helped promote the idea  going so far as claim to have identified several locations where the military was setting up internment areas  rand paul isn t the only one to blame here  fox news  which today is making blanket  factless statements about the  violence  of liberals  was responsible for the original comment by judge napolitano  a longtime contributor to the network and full time nutjob  nobody batted an eye when he encouraged people to lash out at the  tyrannical  government with guns  fox was being viewed by millions of people a day  all being told relentlessly that obama was acting like a dictator  they could connect the dots in conclusion  spare the indignation  conservatives  while we can all agree that violence has no place in the political discourse  that only works if both sides are operating in good faith  so far  republicans have not shown an ability to condemn their own violent extremists the way they have asked liberals to do  without that equal shouldering of the responsibility there can be no true change in the political climate featured image via alex wong getty images
