donald trump s first debate against his democratic rival hillary clinton went just as poorly as we thought it would   and conservatives know it  it s never been more clear that trump doesn t even deserve to be on the same stage as clinton  and all the holes in his campaign are being exposed effortlessly  between the fact checking and not having any real policies or plans in place  trump is f cked big time  luckily  fox news is coming to the rescue with some  truly awful  somewhat hilarious  advice for the inexperienced man baby fox news host charles krauthammer thinks that trump s greatest chances of succeeding during sunday s second presidential debate will rely on trump s amazing ability to lie about everything  basically  krauthammer thinks trump can win if he can  deny it ever happened  and  ignore the fact checkers   the fox host pointed out where trump had gone wrong during the first debate  i think the most important thing here for trump is the morning after  he might have lost the debate  it was pretty close  it was not the rout that people say it was  but he really threw it away the morning after when he went after   he went down the rabbit holes on the miss universe and all the other stuff  and that s happened to him before  krauthammer then tried to give trump some pointers on how to beat a far more experienced  qualified clinton  i think he can hold his own  he just needs to be   to ignore  as everybody here has said   ignore the bait  he should just dismiss all the quotations that he hears  the way that pence did  deny it ever happened and then ignore the fact checkers the next day  it is hilarious that anyone would suggest that trump can  ignore the bait   trump is a loose cannon with the temperament worse than a toddler  literally every time he gets baited  even by clinton herself   he cannot resist taking it and making a bigger ass out of himself  krauthammer is basically begging trump to keep his ego in check  even though he s proven that he s incapable of doing that  conservatives need to start accepting that trump is going to blow this debate just like the first one  no matter how hard they try to guide him you can watch krauthammer try to help trump below featured image via ethan miller   getty images
