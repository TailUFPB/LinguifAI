when a donald trump minion whined about hillary clinton referring to trump supporters as a  basket of deplorables  krystal ball was there to destroy her with the truth during a face off between ball and scottie nell hughes on cnn on saturday  hughes threw a hissy fit because hillary dared to slam trump s racist hateful supporters and called her  desperate  the problem is that trump s supporters are exactly what hillary called them  they are deplorable racists who have stooped to bottom of the barrel politics  they have called for killing or imprisoning hillary and have committed violence against black people at trump rallies all while disparaging latinos and calling president obama a terrorist and krystal ball had no sympathy for hughes considering everything trump supporters have said and done over the last year  to be honest with you  the truth hurts  i don t know that it s half of trump supporters  but you can t deny the fact that you ve got the david dukes of the world in his camp backing him strongly  you can t deny the fact that if you go on white nationalist website stormfront  they love their glorious leader donald trump  you can t deny that when you go to his rallies you hear the n word thrown around casually and hillary clinton referred to as the b word so  he has tapped into this very ugly stream in america i think it s frankly important to point out the kind of company you re keeping if you re going to back somebody like donald trump  and ball is right  trump s campaign is a sea full of racist bigots who hide under white sheets  think we should persecute muslims  and think women should submit to the will of men in fact  polling data backs up hillary clinton s remark according to thinkprogress  polls show that two thirds of trump s supporters think president obama is a muslim  which is not only islamophobic  it s racist  too furthermore   percent of trump s supporters think black people are  lazy  and another  percent think black people are more violent than whites  one third of them think putting japanese americans in internment camps was a good idea   percent think lincoln should not have freed the slaves and  percent of trump s fans in south carolina want to ban gay people from living in the united states so when hillary clinton said that half of trump s supporters are deplorable she was damn spot on but hughes continued to whine  and not only did she defend white supremacists  she oozed hypocrisy  i don t agree with what krystal said about those different groups  i think that it once again is just hillary clinton trying to divide  she doesn t want to unify would you like me to sit there and say that hillary clinton is accountable for cop killings  or for communism or anarchism or all of the crazy fringes that exist on the left right now  here s the video via youtube except that trump and his supporters already regularly accuse hillary clinton of being a communist and have repeatedly blamed her and president obama for the deaths of police officers  and unlike donald trump  hillary clinton has never called for the assassination of her political opponent it should also be pointed out that in addition to hillary slamming trump s deplorable supporters  she did express empathy for trump supporters who have legitimate concerns   people who feel the government has let them down  the economy let them down  nobody cares about them  those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well  featured image  screenshot
