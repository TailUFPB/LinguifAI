while science doesn t quite have the technology to give donald trump the ability to read our minds  his justice department is doing the next worst thing  they are asking for ip addresses of every single person who visited a website that organized inaugural protests  there s a good chance they re after you and me the website  which coordinated protests across the nation on inauguration day  is hosted by dreamhost  and thankfully  they are fighting the warrant from trump s justice department  the request from the  demands that dreamhost hand over   million visitor ip addresses   in addition to contact information  email content  and photos of thousands of people   in an effort to determine who simply visited the website   dreamhost said in monday s post    that information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the constitution s first amendment  that should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone s mind  source  buzzfeedthat kind of data mining would have made joseph mccarthy drool  it s clearly an attempt to gather evidence against trump s opposition  even if that opposition is just regular citizens it s not the first time they have tried going after protesters through internet history   people were arrested during the january  protests and prosecutors have tried to go through facebook to get information about those people federal prosecutors have sought a range of electronic information related to the jan   arrests  including defendants  social media accounts  in a mostly sealed case that the electronic frontier foundation and other digital rights groups believe is related to the jan   arrests  facebook is fighting an order blocking the company from alerting users about search warrants for account information  that case is before the district of columbia court of appeals  the city s highest local court this is all a disgusting violation of privacy  visiting a legal website is evidence of nothing  yet it s clear that trump is gathering a list of people who disagree with him  what he will do with that list is still a mystery  but remember  it wouldn t surprise me if people on that list started seeing letters from the irs or one of our law enforcement agencies at the very least  this as an attempt to control dissent and perhaps make people afraid to organize online  which is by far the most effective way to organize  just like his attempt to gather voter data from states is an attempt at making people afraid to register to vote featured image via pool getty images
