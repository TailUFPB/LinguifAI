since   the united states has been a crucial member of the united nations  and a leader on the world stage  if republicans have their way  however  that will end republicans in congress have been whining about the united nations for decades  and now that donald trump has taken over the white house  they are starting the process to force american withdrawal from the peacekeeping organization why because trump and republicans are mad that the united nations condemned israel for building illegal settlements on palestinian land  in other words  republicans are whining because they think the united nations works for the united states instead of the entire world  just as trump thinks everything is about him  republicans think international relations should be all about the united states so  gop rep  michael rogers has filed the american sovereignty restoration act of  to formally withdraw the united states from the united nations  which would effectively create a power vacuum within the international body that the russians and chinese will seek to fill without american influence  which we have had since the organization s founding  we will be left behind as the world moves on without us  either that  or international cooperation will collapse entirely and throw the world into chaos as nations follow the united states and adopt isolationist policies that will ultimately lead to global wars  the united nations was created to prevent such large scale conflicts in the first place  which is why we have avoided a world war iii the bill specifically directs trump to  terminate all membership by the united states in the united nations  and in any organ  specialized agency  commission  or other formally affiliated body of the united nations  and that means the united states would also be withdrawing from the world bank  the international court of justice  the world health organization  the international monetary fund  the united nations educational  scientific and cultural organization  unesco   and the international atomic energy agency  among many others not only would america be going it alone  withdrawal would affect our ability to keep wannabe nuclear powers like iran in check without starting a war  our withdrawal from international financial institutions could have a devastating effect on the world economy  including our own the united nations would also have to move headquarters out of the united states  which would be a humiliating loss of international prestige for decades  the world has looked to the united states for leadership and cooperation  but republicans apparently want america to withdraw from the world stage   a move that would erase all the progress made over the last seven decades  and tarnish our reputation forever this cannot be allowed to happen  this country has worked too hard to bring democracy and peace to the world to quit now  we should be leaders on the world stage  not isolationists featured image via wikimedia
