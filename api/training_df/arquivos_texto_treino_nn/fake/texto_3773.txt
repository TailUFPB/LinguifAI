donald trump was right about one thing  the election was  rigged  and in more ways than one  from wackyleaks interfering to hackers to exit polling contradicting election results to voter suppression to fbi director james comey s bizarre and vague letter he sent to congress just  days before voters cast their ballots trump s former presidential campaign manager admitted late wednesday that the president elect won the keys to the white house because the fbi renewed its examination of hillary clinton s private email server  according to the hill  with eleven days to go  something amazing happened   corey lewandowski said  the telegraph reports  the fbi s director james  came out on a friday and he said they may be reopening the investigation into  crooked hillary s  emails   he said  what that did was remind people that there are two different rules in washington   those of the elites and the privileged  and those for everybody else   he continued  when comey moved forward with that investigation  it allowed the campaign a little spring in their step  and for them to redouble their efforts   he said  in those last last eleven days mr trump was exceptionally disciplined  he used a teleprompter  he said  without one bit of irony  trump blasted others for using a teleprompter then used one  himself  and then  donald trump won the election campaign by the largest majority since ronald reagan in    lewandowski added without noting that hillary clinton s lead in the popular vote could reach more than  million votes after comey sent congress the letter  he took until two days before election day to say his bureau would not change its earlier conclusion  in other words  comey s assertion that something  pertinent  might be in anthony weiner s emails was a big fat lie  comey did that to interfere with our country s election process  the fbi director was blasted by democrats and some republicans as well  it was a stunningly obvious tactic to put donald trump into power corey lewandowski is expected to be offered a key position in the trump administration yes  the election was  rigged  photo by drew angerer via getty
