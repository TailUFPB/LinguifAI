it s well known by now that trump unsuccessfully pressured comey to end the fbi s investigation into michael flynn and russia  many might think that his attempts to pressure authorities to end that investigation ended with comey  or maybe attorney general jeff sessions  they didn t  a new report from the washington post details how trump went after his newly confirmed director of national intelligence  daniel coats  on this same subject   then started complaining about the fbi investigation and comey s handling of it  said officials familiar with the account coats gave to associates  two days earlier  comey had confirmed in a congressional hearing that the bureau was probing whether trump s campaign coordinated with russia during the  race  the interaction with coats indicates that trump aimed to enlist top officials to have comey curtail the bureau s probe  after that  trump spoke to coats again and asked him to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion between his campaign and russia  he made a similar request of mike rogers  the director of the national intelligence agency  both of them refused to do what trump wanted them to do trump is likely upset that he can t control every part of the executive branch like he no doubt thought he would  nominating and confirming people who have a modicum of integrity  as well as knowledge of how the intelligence community and white house should behave with respect to each other  has only served to push trump into a very uncomfortable corner while trump and his allies continue to deny that anything ever happened  up to and including lying through their teeth  we have to ask one question  if trump knows he s innocent  why try to interfere in the investigations this way  why behave like there s a cover up  once again  none of this is the behavior of an innocent man  it s the behavior of someone with something to hide featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
