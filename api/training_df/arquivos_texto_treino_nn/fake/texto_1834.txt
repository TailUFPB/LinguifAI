let s face it  if it weren t for gerrymandering  russian interference and straight up lies  republicans would never hold another majority again and they d certainly never hold the presidency  unfortunately  that s not our reality and republicans in iowa are so desperate that they are turning to lies to keep people from voting iowa s secretary of state  paul pete  wants to pass stricter voting restrictions in an effort to keep undesirables  democrats   especially democrats of color  from voting and he s lying to justify it to substantiate his argument  pate s office drafted a statement for a reporter from the local gazette newspaper  noting that in iowa it appeared  felons had cast ballots and that more than  election day voter registrations  or edrs  had bounced back  the draft statement included the caveats that the irregularities  do not necessarily constitute fraud  and that the state would have a more complete picture of election data come march  pate urged his staff to release it  we need to release info and these stats are public already  when an auditor turns them over to the county attorney or sheriff for action that pretty much makes it public  am i missing something    he wrote in an email source  huffington postin a state of three million people   felons voting doesn t exactly seem like a reason to change voting laws for everyone  but even that paltry number is vastly misleading  according to pate s deputy  carol olson  i do not believe that we should say that  felons illegally cast ballots  we encouraged them to use provisional ballots  so that would feel a little like we baited them to do something illegal   she wrote   and it s risky to label it  illegal  because we don t know the circumstances  it might be illegal  but  might not be  if someone really believed their rights were restored  we can report the number of felons voting  but let s not call it illegal   she wrote olson noted that some of the statistics suggested something nefarious when it could simply be attributed to human error  i m also really reluctant to say that  edr s  sic  from  counties bounced back  in the context of a discussion on election fraud  it sounds like we are suggesting that  bounce backs  are fraud or likely to be fraud   she wrote   first  it s only a partial report  what about the other  counties  how does this fit into the overall process of edrs  the vast majority of these  bounce backs  are sloppy addresses from voters in too much of a hurry when they register at the polls  that s a real reason to discourage edr and a real reason to have pollbooks  but it s not an indicator of illegal activity  regardless  it s likely the bill  that will require voter ids  will pass  nearly ensuring that the state  which has long been a red leaning swing state  will become a red state featured image via alex wong getty images
