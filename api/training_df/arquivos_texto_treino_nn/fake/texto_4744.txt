if there is one thing the  election has shown  it s that there is no such thing as a liberal media bias  from free air time for donald trump to ridiculous  over sensationalized bad press for hillary clinton  the media conglomerates have shown there is a preferred candidate  and it certainly isn t the liberal one not only has broadcast media shown itself to be completely inept and biased in favor of donald trump  but print and digital media  which younger voters rely on more heavily than anyone else  has shown its true colors as well  it is not liberal  but it does have a bias  and it certainly isn t in favor of hillary clinton it all stems from when the associated press released shock waves through the political establishment when it  reported  on the clinton foundation s alleged pay for play  hinting that hillary clinton used her power as secretary of state to give preferential  special treatment to donors and heads of state involved with her family foundation  similarly  the new york times and boston globe picked up the story with eerily similar tones  calling on the clinton foundation to be shutdown  clinton herself investigated  and castes doubts on her ability to be  ethical  not surprisingly  republicans pounced on the story  but even liberal hacks like vice s michael tracey and ibt s david sirota  who are openly to the left of mrs  clinton s political leanings  were calling for the secretary s head on a silver platter  once again  the seeds of distrust among liberals were sown well  then the truth came out and it turns out the ap botched the story  as pointed out by americablog news editor john aravosis the ap incorrectly reported that half of those who met with clinton as cabinet secretary gave money to the clinton foundation  the associated press gave the number as  out of  people it doesn t take a genius to see the one glaring giveaway  does anyone really think that clinton  who was secretary of state for four years and had the record travel mileage and country visitation  met with only  people during her tenure  the fact is this  clinton met  personally  with over   people as secretary of state  of which then only  were foundation donors  which equals a measly  percent aravosis also points out that the ap blew their  smoking gun  claim when referring to muhammed yunus  a major donor of the clinton foundation who was able to meet with secretary clinton herself  considering yunus has won an nobel peace prize for his tireless efforts to reduce global poverty  and banking empowerment for poor people  it would seem almost normal for him to meet with clinton  who made global poverty alleviation a staple in her smart diplomacy agenda at the state department  my god  hillary clinton  whose job it is to work with other countries to tackle global issues  which includes alleviating poverty  met with a world renowned philanthropist who happened to give to her foundation  which also works to alleviate poverty   unheard of optics has apparently taken over true investigative journalism so even with these shoddy examples provided by the associated press  that didn t stop the other  liberal  outlets like the new york times from telling clinton to sever ties with her foundation  and boston globe from calling on the foundation to be shutdown outright and while all this was going on  it was actually discovered that only one candidate running for president of the united states was found to have engaged in an actual pay for play scheme with their foundation  donald trump according to reports  donald trump s foundation illegally bribed florida attorney general pam bondi with    to drop a lawsuit pertaining to trump university  the irs fined the trump foundation    for the act yet can anyone recall hearing about it  which was blasted more all over the news  the  alleged  pay for play from clinton that is not based on evidence  or the one where the irs fined trump for actually engaging in pay for play did the new york times call on trump to shutdown his foundation  did the boston globe call on trump to sever ties with it  did anyone  from cnn to fox news cast any doubt on trump s unethical  and illegal  behavior of bribing an elected official no  they did not  even though the evidence is concrete  mainstream media will still use the word  allegedly  when pertaining to trump  but will continue to call on clinton to be investigated even with no evidence and with that  the new york times  associated press  boston globe  and other media elites should apologize to clinton  denounce trump  and move on unless any new evidence contradicts clinton s claims  so far  nothing has  featured image via justin sullivan getty images
