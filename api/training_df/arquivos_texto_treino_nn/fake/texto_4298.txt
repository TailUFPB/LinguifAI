as the deseret news said on saturday  they haven t endorsed a candidate in  years  but they made it clear who shouldn t be president in a damning editorial trump supporters are going to hate  we are neutral on matters of partisan politics   the editorial began   we do  however  feel a duty to speak clearly on issues that affect the well being and morals of the nation  accordingly  today we call on donald trump to step down from his pursuit of the american presidency  unlike some evangelical conservative  christian  leaders like tony perkins and ralph reed  who still support trump even after his lewd comments about groping women dropped like a bombshell on friday  the mormon owned newspaper roundly condemned trump and called for him to resign his candidacy  citing his lack of character the idea that women secretly welcome the unbridled and aggressive sexual advances of powerful men has led to the mistreatment  sorrow and subjugation of countless women for far too much of human history the notion that strength emanates from harsh  divisive and unbending rhetorical flourish mistakenly equates leadership with craven intimidation the belief that the party and the platform matter more than the character of the candidate ignores the wisdom of the ages that   when the wicked beareth rule  the people mourn    proverbsthe editorial pointed to trump s history of making misogynistic comments about women and said that trump has failed time and time again to demonstrate the  ethical behavior  that presidents need to govern a nation with compassion  understanding  and respect  and then the editorial took aim at trump s supporters in the face of these revelations  it is disheartening to see otherwise decent individuals now attempting to defend trump s talk  dismissing it as mere  locker room  bravado  at the time of the audio recording  trump was not a hormonal teenage athlete  but rather a  year old husband of an expectant mother and the father of four children america s locker rooms deserve better the deseret news concluded by calling on trump to resign but if he doesn t  americans need to stand against him in november this is one of those rare moments where it is necessary to take a clear stand against the hucksterism  misogyny  narcissism and latent despotism that infect the trump campaign even as we hope for a more auspicious future of liberty  prosperity and peace for the nation and it looks like the people will have to take that stand in november because donald trump has vowed to stay in the race  let s just hope voters reject him by a landslide so that republicans are never stupid enough to nominate someone like him ever again featured image  jessica kourkounis getty images
