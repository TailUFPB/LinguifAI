donald trump is dangerous as president  anyone who has been watching this trainwreck first in campaign mode  and then during transition  and now during the actual presidency  knows this  unfortunately  the republicans in washington who are in a position to actually do something seem to be completely ignoring the fact that trump is completely out of his mind  has shown himself to be a dangerous authoritarian  and  most troubling of all  seems to have some very scary ties to russia and its autocratic leader  vladimir putin well  there is one person on television who isn t going to mince words when it comes to trump  bill maher  host of hbo s real time  on friday night  maher really let trump have it  he lit into the disastrous insanity that was trump s first solo press conference as president  and then went on to blatantly call trump a nutcase  he even said that in some ways  trump is actually worse than german dictator adolf hitler  you know your facebook friend who said he thought trump was hitler  he was optimistic  what we have here is a mental patient who thinks he s hitler  the kid in the youtube video who is high from the dentist made more sense  maher then went on to remind his audience not to get distracted by smaller outrages so that we take our eyes off the really dangerous happenings within the trump white house  and indeed  with trump himself  while you re watching the clown screw the pony  they re breaking into your car  at the end of the day  there s just too much goodness and vital truth in this monologue to even begin to do it justice  all i know is that bill maher will be a very important voice when it comes to helping america make it through this presidency with our sanity intact watch the brilliant video below featured image via video screen capture
