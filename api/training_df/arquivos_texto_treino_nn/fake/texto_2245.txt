donald trump screwed himself over by letting his tiny little hands go twitter happy over the weekend  just because he was pissed off over jeff sessions  recusal  trump failed to manage his emotions like an adult and couldn t keep his temper tantrum in check  america watched on  horrified  as the current potus accused former president barack obama of wiretapping his phones in the trump tower on saturday morning  and now  he s facing severe consequences as people want answers it is already highly probably that trump has zero evidence to back up his accusation of obama  mostly because he frequently lies and spreads false information based on his emotional state  trump has also repeatedly been asked to provide concrete proof that obama tapped his phones  and hasn t been able to show anything that would make his inappropriate accusations believable  even trump s fellow republicans are demanding answers to such a ridiculous attack  one of them being sen  john mccain  who has been a critical conservative voice against trump since his presidential campaign on monday  mccain demanded that trump release evidence to support his allegations  and also trashed the white house for not being able to provide more information about trump s claims  mccain argued that americans have a right to know on what basis the president of the united states said that his predecessor had broken the law by wiretapping trump tower  clearly shocked by the whole matter  mccain admitted to reporters   i haven t seen anything like this   noting that the trump administration  should answer questions   mccain said  the american people should demand it  the dimensions of this are huge  mccain went on to say just how shocking trump s weekend tweets had been  mccain admitted that when he saw trump s first tweet against obama on saturday morning  his first reaction was  intense curiosity  this is unprecedented  i have never heard of a president of the united states accusing his predecessor or any other president of the united states of violating the law  trump had given america many firsts over the past year or so  and none of them were good  that is something we all can agree on  regardless of party affiliation  mccain s comments prove that even the gop is regretful and fed up of trump s behavior featured image via alex wong   getty images
