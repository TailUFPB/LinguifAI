i will confess  i belong to a faction of the left that hates war in any context  i turned  during the brief skirmish known as operation desert shield  and even then  i wasn t skipping school to go to the mall  i was spray painting anti war slogans on every concrete surface in my little town i could get away with okay  i was going to the mall too that last part is important because what i mean to convey is that while i have always opposed war in every way  i was also a pretty realistic kid  even then  i understood that my complaints lodged in krylon  on the side of a bridge were mostly meaningless  in that context  i approach the left who are even further to the left than me  yes  we are embroiled in the longest war in the history of the united states in afghanistan  yes  we are  fighting  an invisible war on terror  yes  i hate those things  i also understand that the complaints i now lodge in facebook posts  tweets  and these articles are like colored mists on the bridges and walls of war in the end  the fury of war can only be mitigated by absolutely minimizing the innocent victims of it  but how can that be accomplished in a war against isis  an enemy that recruits civilians  uses them as human shields and otherwise disregards humanity in the name of jihad there are those on the left that condemn president barack obama for increasing the number of drone strikes initiated by the united states in the middle east and south asia  and those on the right simply condemn him for existing  so i will stand with whoever has identified with me so far here and give credit to our  president for mitigating the level of civilian deaths in those ongoing wars using tactical precision i like to think that barack obama opposes war in the way that i do  absolutely  but if it is happening  it must be done in a way that keeps the most civilians safe by contrast  donald trump does not understand war  he certainly does not oppose it  i believe that he sees it only in the abstract  an ongoing effort to  win  at all costs  like everything in his life  almost like war is a jacket and hat you put on for the cameras the numbers bear this theory out  according to airwars  a uk based  transparency project  that has tracked the number of civilians killed since the us led coalition formed in october  to combat isis  there is a disparity between obama s direction and trump s that cannot be reconciled any other way our minimum estimate of civilians likely killed by coalition since  is now     with   of deaths occuring under trump s leadership pic twitter com   airwars   airwars  august     barackobama s  months at helm of isis war we tracked  alleged civilian casualty events which likely killed   civilians pic twitter com   airwars   airwars  august     realdonaldtrump s first  months as president  we tracked   alleged incidents in which we assess at least     civilians died pic twitter com   airwars   airwars  august    deaths in war cannot be avoided  that is a simple fact  but even if you go back to the new york times link i provided above   the number of drone strikes    you can see that precision can mitigate them  bush ordered  drone strikes which killed  terrorists and  civilians   a   civilian casualty rate  under obama  the strikes went up  but the casualty rate went down  ten times as many strikes  more than ten times as many dead terrorists  but less than twice as many civilian casualties  just over    at the time of that report like his presidency  trump s war is messy  more than half of all civilian deaths in the war against isis have occurred in the  months since donald trump was inaugurated that s not opposition  that is an embrace of war featured image via mark wilson getty images
