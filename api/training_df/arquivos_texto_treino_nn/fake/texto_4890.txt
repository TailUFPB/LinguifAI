this might shock you  but in their clumsy and pathetic efforts to smear hillary clinton as a ku klux klan supporter because she considered democratic senator robert byrd a  friend and mentor   conservatives leave out a lot of relevant information clinton s opponent in the  presidential race  donald j  trump  is pretty much the  kkkandidate   not only do white supremacists hang on his every word as he promises to build a wall to keep brown people he calls  rapists  and  murderers  out of the country and to force muslims to wear special little badges to identify them  not to mention the national muslim registry and concentration camps   but he has been endorsed by numerous kkk members  both past and present  this  of course  includes david duke  who is no longer a member of the klan but is involved with white supremacist group  the naawp  the national association for the advancement of white people hillary clinton s recent campaign ad points out these associations  showing clips of actual klansmen praising donald trump   and trump and pals are just desperate to find something   anything   with which they can distract from the very real  verifiable fact that trump is the official klandidate the very flimsy thread upon which they depend to make this case is robert c  byrd  unlike duke  who is an unabashed white supremacist  byrd s time with the klan was short lived  ultimately  as a thinking and learning human being he dropped out of the klan in   saying  after about a year  i became disinterested   quit paying my dues  and dropped my membership in the organization  byrd spent much of his  years in congress repeatedly apologizing for his involvement with the klan  i know now i was wrong  intolerance had no place in america  i apologized a thousand times   and i don t mind apologizing over and over again  i can t erase what happened  in other words  byrd learned from his mistakes  in fact  after he passed away  the naacp issued a statement in  honoring him the naacp is saddened by the passing of united states senator robert byrd  byrd  the longest serving member of congress was first elected to the u s  house from  in  and was elected senator in   byrd passed away this morning at the age of   senator byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation   stated naacp president and ceo benjamin todd jealous   senator byrd went from being an active member of the kkk to a being a stalwart supporter of the civil rights act  the voting rights act and many other pieces of seminal legislation that advanced the civil rights and liberties of our country  senator byrd came to consistently support the naacp civil rights agenda  doing well on the naacp annual civil rights report card  he stood with us on many issues of crucial importance to our members from the reauthorization of the voting rights act  the historic health care legislation of  and his support for the hate crimes prevention legislation   stated hilary o  shelton  director of the naacp washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy   senator byrd was a master of the senate rules  and helped strategize passage of legislation that helped millions of americans  he will be sorely missed  you don t exactly see the naacp praising duke or trump  do you nevertheless  republicans have been accusing the media of  ignoring  this association between clinton and byrd  circulating a photo of this man the naacp points to as an example of the  transformative power  of the united states  the ability for people with rather abhorrent prejudices to change their viewpoints  kissing clinton on the cheek and  of course  there s her praise of byrd after his passing robert byrd was not a perfect man  but he was always eager to learn from and make up for his mistakes  he spent most of his career tirelessly working to atone for the hate that once consumed him  to those who are not complete idiots  the story of robert byrd is one of healing  one of redemption  and certainly not a can of worms republicans would want to open if they  like byrd  were thinking individuals capable of change unfortunately  they are not  it s not the  anymore  how many times must they be reminded of this featured image via facebook
