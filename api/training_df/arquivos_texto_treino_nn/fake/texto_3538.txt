donald trump and all his cohorts are exalting him as a master of business following his deal with carrier to keep roughly   jobs in indiana  while still moving more than half to mexico anyway   he did it by giving them a whopping   million tax break and other incentives  which told the rest of the corporate world that if they want more tax breaks  they should threaten to send jobs out of the country so this might have saved some americans  jobs  and in the short term  that s a good thing  however  there s a catch  carrier has announced that it will raise its prices in january  a death spiral can begin with that  and it appears that it s something trump only fleetingly considered carrier insists that their decision to raise prices has nothing to do with their decision to keep some jobs here  indeed  they did announce their price increase a week before trump reached a deal with them  the problem is that  if their prices go up and competitors  prices don t  they ll find themselves at a disadvantage if they find they actually need the price increase to offset higher manufacturing costs  then those saved jobs could disappear anyway there are also global forces that have taken manufacturing jobs away from the u s  that we can t stop no matter how many individual deals trump manages to strike  carrier  and others  may find themselves not just at a disadvantage with each other  but at a severe disadvantage with foreign competitors  even if trump tries to slap a tariff on those imports  which won t work  as many people have noted  striking deals with companies one by one is not the way to improve our jobs market or our economy  and economists all over the political spectrum believe this is a seriously bad idea   they destroy an economy from the inside out  even sarah palin recognizes this as crony capitalism  and sarah palin is about as dense and clueless as they come  the government is not a business and trump needs to stop acting like it is besides all that  other companies that game trump to get bigger tax breaks could still raise their prices  and still basically do what greedy corporations do to enrich themselves and fuck the rest of us sideways with rusty chainsaws  we need broad economic policy and overhaul  not individual deals with manufacturers and huge tariffs on companies that offshore jobs whether carrier was already going to raise prices or not  this little announcement shows one of the many dark sides of trump s approach to saving jobs  in the end  it s not likely to work featured image by tasos katopodis via getty images
