there are only three things for certain in this world  death  taxes  and trump golfing every weekend  today featured all three in a way two days ago  trump spent around   million in tax dollars to bomb an empty airbase in syria  the symbolic attack did little to stop the syrian government s ability to bomb its citizens   bombers were reportedly back to using the airstrip just hours later   but it had the effect of inflaming already high tensions between the united states and supporters of the syrian regime in russia and iran so covering death and taxes  trump moved onto golf the fact that he would go on vacation just days after creating an international crisis was so painfully obvious that protesters planned for it  when trump s motorcade was spotted on route to his golf course in florida  the signs came out to greet him  according to reporters riding with trump  the stuff trump saw should put to rest any notion that he isn t aware that much of the country despises him pool  motorcade passed  group of about a dozen protesters w  signs reading  resign    loser   and  impeach trump  outside the golf course    kyle griffin     april    s not clear yet whether trump plans to lie about his golf outing as he s done in previous weeks  by a rough count  trump has golfed around  times since becoming president  weeks ago  many of those vacations were done in secret  with his staff covering for him with claims that he was in  meetings   inevitably  pictures of trump in golf attire hitting the links turn up online exposing just how shameless this administration is the fact that protesters can be so certain that trump will be golfing   even after committing america to a possible war in syria   is incredibly disheartening  you can plan your day around the assumption that the most powerful person in the country will be slipping into golfing shoes every single weekend  hilariously  this criticism was most clearly leveled by one of trump s biggest defenders  sean hannity in   hannity hypocritically slammed obama of playing golf during the syrian civil war the war in syria rages on but so far hannity hasn t complained about any one of trump s  golf outings  odd  and further undermining hannity s complaint  trump has spent so much time golfing that he s now spent a quarter of obama s total cost in travel expenses in just his first  weeks  by the end of his first year  he will have cost the american taxpayer over   million report  obama s travel expenses were   over eight years  trump is at   in  wks https   t co   brandon pope tv   bpopetv  april    image via  ian macnicol getty images
