trump s department of justice has finally figured out they re stupid in one instance  at least  back in january  a member of code pink named desiree fairooz laughed during jeff sessions  confirmation hearing  was charged with disorderly conduct  found guilty  and faced up to a full year in prison for it  a d c  court tossed out her conviction and set a new trial  but now the doj has dropped the case entirely here s the justice department s notice it s dropping charges against woman who laughed at jeff sessions during his confirmation hearing  pic twitter com   dominic holden   dominicholden  november     own reaction to the news says it all about the stupidity of this endeavor just received this   governments notice of nolle prosequi  what a relief  guess they ve got enough  laughing  matters to deal with   desiree fairooz   desireefairooz  november    laughed because she felt senator shelby s overly syrupy remarks about sessions alleged record of treating everyone equally were as ridiculous as they sound  sessions treats people anything but equally and he has a long track record of that  code pink s campaign director said fairooz  laughter was a reflex action more than anything  which actually does make a lot of sense  fairooz herself didn t mean to actually laugh  but she did say  i felt it was my responsibility as a citizen to dissent at the confirmation hearing of senator jeff sessions  a man who professes anti immigrant  anti lgbt policies  who has voted against several civil rights measures and who jokes about the white supremacist terrorist group the ku klux klan  that s the whole problem  though  the trump administration doesn t want dissent  and while it s true that fairooz had several prior arrests for protesting  the number of cases publicly brought against dissenters of this administration is absolutely astonishing  this is a victory for all who stand for what s right which is the opposite of what trump s administration stands for featured image via alex wong getty images
