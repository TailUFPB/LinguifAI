while the president of the united states seems to be very  very confused about how racism  violence  and bigotry should be dealt with  many americans are not  in response to the horrific white supremacist rally in charlottesville  virginia  numerous politicians and companies have raised their voices and taken a stand against white supremacy in a way that donald trump has not  one of the best responses so far has come from online dating site okcupid  who responded perfectly when it discovered that neo nazi chris cantwell was one of its members cantwell recently got his  minutes of fame when he was seen in a viral video crying about being arrested by police after the charlottesville attack  once okcupid was alerted that cantwell was a member on the dating website  the company worked quickly to show that white supremacist values would not be tolerated  in response   white supremacist chris cantwell  has been banned from okcupid   for life  this is the perfect response to a hateful imbecile who stated publicly in the viral video that neo nazis like himself were  not nonviolent  and we ll fucking kill these people if we have to   okcupid made an entirely appropriate move to not only protect its other members from dating a dangerously unstable psychopath like cantwell  but to also show that these attitudes should not be tolerated in any degree to add an extra sting to the end of cantwell s dating life  especially after he looked so pathetic in that video   okcupid followed up their banning announcement with this perfect tweet bravo  we certainly hope this will encourage more companies to handle intolerant individuals in the same way  when we can t count on our president to do what should be morally obvious  we must count on each other to uphold the true values of this country featured image is a screenshot
