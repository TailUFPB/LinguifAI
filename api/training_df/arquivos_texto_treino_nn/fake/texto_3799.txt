during an interview  steve bannon  who is the new white house strategist under donald trump  just referred to left wing women as  a bunch of dykes  steve bannon was recently appointed as a senior adviser for trump  but he is not a good fit for the job  he s just an egotistical blogger  as chairman of breitbart news he is known for his right winged bias  which is quite clear here  in this interview he says right wing women  are of the highest moral character  while on the left we vilify women  incredible that he would say this  and then less than a minute later  refer to them as  a bunch of dykes   you can listen to that irony right here there will always be some friction between the right and left  but referring to our liberal women as dykes is a little over the line  especially for the senior adviser of the white house  then again  look who he advises  donald trump  who is well known for degrading women  it s sad to see men like this controlling our government photo by chip somodevilla getty images
