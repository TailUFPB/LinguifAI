this should concern every single american in january   trump was in the middle of trying to secure the republican nomination when he praised north korean dictator kim jong un s deadly strategy of maintaining his power  if you look at north korea  this guy  he s like a maniac  ok  and you ve got to give him credit  how many young guys   he was like  or  when his father died   take over these tough generals  and all of a sudden   you know  it s pretty amazing when you think of it  how does he do that  even though it is a culture  and it s a cultural thing  he goes in  he takes over  he s the boss  it s incredible  he wiped out the uncle  he wiped out this one  that one  this guy doesn t play games  and we can t play games with him  and trump still admires that strategy more than a year later  only this time  trump is in the white house during his interview with john dickerson on sunday  trump once again expressed his admiration of the north korean dictator s use of execution to remain in power  people are saying  is he sane   i have no idea but he was a young man of  or  when he took over from his father  when his father died  he s dealing with obviously very tough people  a lot of people  i m sure  tried to take that power away  whether it was his uncle or anybody else  and he was able to do it  so obviously  he s a pretty smart cookie  here s the video via cbs this should scare americans  especially since it appears trump is employing other strategies that tyrants use to consolidate power so far  trump has used threats  intimidation  hate  and fear as tools to expand and consolidate his own power  he has attacked the media and the first amendment  he is so paranoid that he even conducts witch hunts throughout his administration to find and fire people who leak information to the media  anyone who criticizes him also gets fired  as one of ben carson s aides found out in february and kim jong un isn t the first dictator trump has praised  he praised philippine leader rodrigo duterte last year and has invited him to visit the white house  trump has openly praised vladimir putin  and he shook hands with egyptian dictator abdel fattah al sisi a president taking the step of executing people may sound like an impossibility  but trump exhibits most of the traits of being a fascist  he has already flouted the laws of our country and ignored the constitution  republicans in congress have demonstrated that they really don t care how trump uses his power  which means he can abuse it  and he has already done so repeatedly  trump colluded with russia to steal the election and he has openly accused a former sitting president of a felony  and that s on top of a mountain of lies that trump has been telling since his inauguration  trump has also urged his followers to beat up protesters and has made it clear that he considers americans who oppose him as the enemy trump s praise of kim jong un s use of executions should make americans scream even louder for his impeachment or resignation  there s a pattern here and americans need to recognize it because we are only  days into a four year term  and it could only be a matter of time before trump takes his desire to be a dictator to the next level featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
