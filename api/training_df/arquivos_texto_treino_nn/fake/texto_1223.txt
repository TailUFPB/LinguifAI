this last week has been an seemingly unending stream of terrifying  disturbing news about trump and his administration  adding to the mental instability and emotional immaturity of trump  republicans have renewed their push to strip  million americans of healthcare  so it is with great relief that we can take a breather from all the terror to enjoy a moment of national unity  in laughing at ted cruz the texas senator and one time republican presidential candidate was attending the conservative  faith and freedom coalition conference   he was not the headliner  that distinction went to the man who once called his wife ugly and suggested he had dirt on her that he would leak to the press  the headliner was also the guy who once accused ted s dad of helping assassinate john f  kennedy  the headliner was the guy ted cruz called a  pathological liar  and a  sniveling coward    and the same guy who cruz eventually endorsed for president cruz had to play second fiddle to trump but cruz s humiliation at the faith and freedom event was only getting started  during what was meant to be a fiery speech  cruz was starting to hit his stride when suddenly  the announcer broke in  applause broke out  and a new speaker walked on to the stage  cruz  looking confused and slightly hurt  was literally played off stage to music cspan  the government provided channel not known for its humor  even caught the moment and blasted it out to twitter  signalboosting cruz s embarrassment sen   tedcruz is cut off in the middle of his remarks at the  faithandfreedom coalition conference  full video here  https   t co  pic twitter com   cspan   cspan  june    result was nothing short of incredible  giving humanity the precious gift of this incredible moment as cruz wandered slowly off stage  the next speaker just moved on without even addressing the awkwardness  cruz  robbed of yet another moment to shine  had to watch in the wings for the next hour or so until the headliner came out onto stage featured image via c span
