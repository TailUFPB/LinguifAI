with the inauguration fast approaching  donald trump is trying to prove to himself that he is actually liked by the american people  and after pretty much every singer or performer of high recognition and notoriety wants absolutely nothing to do with him  he now has a singer from the  s reality tv show america s got talent not to knock the singer  however  jackie evancho is extremely talented  however  no one really knows who she is  yet  she did decide to do the inauguration  so  for whatever reasons the  year old decided to perform  more power to her putting the talent of evancho aside  trump seems to be taking credit for her success  because  well  that s what he does trump tweeted  jackie evancho s album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance some people just don t understand the  movement jackie evancho s album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performance some people just don t understand the  movement   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     trump supporters everywhere probably have been buying her album  and since no one really was before  it likely did quadruple her sales  and good for her however  this tweet isn t about evancho at all  it s about the fact that trump is trying to stick it to every performer who turned him down  he s basically trying to say   look what you could have had   which  by the way  i doubt beyonce  justin timberlake  elton john  etc  are really blinking an eye at trump can t handle people not liking him  so he says things that try to make it appear that this is what you could have if you liked him  but guess what  he said he didn t need those performers when hillary clinton had them  so why  after all that  would he be surprised that people want nothing to do with him trump is just a thin skinned man with an extraordinarily fragile ego who tries to overcompensate wherever and whenever he can  sad featured image via scott olson getty images
