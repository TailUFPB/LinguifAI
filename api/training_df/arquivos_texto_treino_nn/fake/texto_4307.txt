robert de niro was supposed to appear in a non partisan public service announcement for the get out the vote organization  vote your future  but the actor had a difficult time staying on script  instead  he used the opportunity to go off on trump in one of the most passionate anti trump videos to date  he s so blatantly stupid   the video beings   he s a punk  he s a dog  please don t insult dogs  robert   he s a pig  he s a con  a bullshit artist  a mutt  again with the dog insult  who doesn t know what he s talking about  he doesn t do his homework   de niro continued   doesn t care  he s gaming society  doesn t pay his taxes  he s an idiot  colin powell said it best   he s a national disaster  he s an embarrassment to this country   it makes me so angry   added de niro   that this country has gotten to this point that this fool  this bozo  has wound up where he has  he talks how he wants to punch people in the face   a visibly angry de niro said vote your future chose not to include the video in their campaign  since they are non partisan  oddly  though  fox news  megyn kelly did air the segment  in fact  it was giving specifically to her  here it is the video was recorded before friday s game changing video of donald trump talking about groping women  but the timing coincided very well  you can be sure that de niro s opinion hasn t changed is the fact that kelly  on fox news  was the person to release this video a sign that fox news is turning on the gop candidate or is this just another shot in kelly s war against trump as for de niro  bravo  although it s not a huge risk to turn on trump these days  everyone in hollywood  from republican politicians to evangelical christians  are turning on trump  the only remaining mystery is why people still support this narcissistic  thin skinned  racist  nationalistic  misogynistic monster featured image via kevin winter getty images
