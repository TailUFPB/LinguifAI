many americans have been begging donald trump to delete his twitter account for the sake of the country s reputation  and twitter might have actually found a way to make him quit the social media platform for good in an effort to combat  fake news   twitter is developing a feature that will allow its users to flag tweets that contain false or harmful information   which pretty much describes every tweet that trump posts  twitter s vice president of policy  colin crowell  stated that twitter is working hard to detect spammy behaviors we ve been doubling down on our efforts  this feature is currently in the prototype phase  and is being noted as twitter s most aggressive attempt yet to maintain the integrity of the content that appears on its platform  according to the washington post  this feature would work as a small tab in a drop down menu next to tweets  according to two anonymous sources  twitter is still testing and researching this function carefully  as there are concerns that legitimate information could also be censored if this feature could be manipulated this might not only kill trump s tweets  but it will also have a major effect on his audience  trump loves to brag about how big his following is on twitter  yet third party service twitter audit states that over half     of trump s audience is comprised of fake accounts or bots while this feature is very much in the early phases and there is no guarantee that it will definitely be implemented  this is big news for trump s presidency  and while the company hasn t said anything about targeting trump with this initiative  one can only wonder as we recall the words of twitter s co founder  evan williams  it s a very bad thing  twitter s role in that  if it s true that he wouldn t be president if it weren t for twitter  then yeah  i m sorry  featured image via joe raedle   getty images
