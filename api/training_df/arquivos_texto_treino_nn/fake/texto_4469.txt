former new york city mayor rudy giuliani decided to weigh in on future president hillary clinton s ability to perform as president in a worse way than trump s  stamina  remarks at the first presidential debate  according to giuliani  the fact that clinton is strong enough and loves her husband enough to make things work after he was unfaithful to her is actually a sign of weakness that disqualifies her from being president just as much as that one time she coughed and her almost superhuman ability to work hard and power through pneumonia for days before she finally collapses from the unnatural amount of strain she put on her body  the president of the united states  her husband  disgraced this country with what he did in the oval office and she didn t just stand by him  she attacked monica lewinsky   giuliani said following monday s debate   and after being married to bill clinton for  years  if you didn t know the moment monica lewinsky said that bill clinton violated her that she was telling the truth  then you re too stupid to be president  bill clinton didn t actually  violate  anybody  he fooled around with a woman  who was an adult and consented to everything they did  behind his wife s back  while she certainly had the right to be angry  and americans absolutely have the right to criticize him  he was wrong  but it didn t affect his ability to run the country   to say that she is a weak person for staying with him is absolute bullsh t  clinton s strength is in her ability to forgive  to think of the bigger picture  to make her marriage work in spite of a very  very public affair of course  this is the sort of thinking that can be expected from a guy who was mayor when the planes hit the twin towers on september     yet recently completely forgot about those attacks while he was criticizing president obama  who paraded his mistress around for all to see  and who told the media he was divorcing his wife before he informed her or their children  under those eight years  before obama came along  we didn t have any successful radical islamic terrorist attack inside the united states   giuliani said in a speech in youngstown  ohio earlier last month  they all started when clinton and obama got into office  watch it below https   twitter com asvokos status  video  image via screengrab
