concerns about trump s conflict of interest reached a new level with the announcement that the national park service is finalizing plans that will give one of his companies   million in tax subsidies for the hotel he put in d c  s old post office building  while it s true that he spent the morning tweeting about getting out of his business entirely  he will very likely get this break  which puts those millions in his pockets  before he actually divests  if he actually divests  trump  ivanka  and his two sons together own trump old post office  llc   and the tax break comes from the  historic rehabilitation tax credits  program  which provides breaks to companies and investors that rehab historic properties ordinarily  this would be something we might mutter and mumble over  because really  does trump need a tax credit of any kind  we might have muttered and mumbled a little louder if this had happened before he was elected  too  but now  with him actually being the president elect  and the park service technically working for him even if not officially  there s a major problem they just gave their new employer a break on his taxes trump s lease on the old post office strictly prohibits  any elected official of the government of the united states   from participating  the general services administration would be wise to break their contract if trump doesn t disappear from that hotel post haste a professor of government procurement at the george washington university school of law agrees that this is a massive conflict of interest  this is a classic or textbook example of a conflict of interest  the decision maker here  the national park service  works for the party that stands to benefit from a favorable decision  trump s announcement that he s going to divest himself of his business interests entirely does little to change this  because he s still insisting that his kids will run his empire for him  generally  placing assets in a blind trust means turning them over to someone who has no direct involvement with you  let alone the relationship of parent and child divesting means getting out of them completely trump doesn t seem to have any intention of doing either  given that his children are top members of his transition team  he does plan to hold a news conference in two weeks where he ll supposedly give details of his divestiture  that will also give them time to actually figure out how to extricate him from all his businesses that doesn t stop the fact that he s set to get a massive tax break very soon  possibly before he s fully divested  if that s even his plan     million is not pocket change to the average american taxpayer  and it doesn t look good going into the president s own pocket featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
