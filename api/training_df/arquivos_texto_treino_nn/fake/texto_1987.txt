this is what being pathetic looks like house speaker paul ryan was so desperate to secure republican votes for his disastrous healthcare bill that he literally got down on his knees to beg one lawmaker for his support as we all know  the floor vote was canceled on thursday after it became clear that not enough republicans were willing to support the bill donald trump even met with and threatened republicans with consequences if they didn t fall in line  but the meeting backfired as even more republicans leaned against the bill after hearing trump speak the cancellation of thursday s vote infuriated trump  who proceeded to demand a vote on friday and republican leaders reluctantly caved and so  paul ryan spent time fruitlessly begging his republican colleagues to throw their support behind a bad bill that would have stripped healthcare from over  million americans and caused the cost of healthcare premiums to skyrocket one lawmaker ryan approached was alaska rep  don young according to the washington post  ryan actually got down on one knee to beg young to endorse the bill leaders continued to plead with individual lawmakers to support the measure well into thursday night  with the house rules committee slated to meet early friday morning to consider the proposed changes ryan got down on a knee to plead with rep  don young  an  year old from alaska who is the longest serving republican in congress and remains undecided but young ignored ryan desperate plea and remained in opposition and even praised the cancellation of friday s vote a  victory for alaska  my job is to represent those people in that state  and i think we did this this week   young told alaska dispatch news   i work with  house speaker paul ryan   don t get me wrong   the speaker talked to me quite a bit  but it didn t come to a point where i could support this bill  he needed my vote  yeah  he needed it so much that he begged for it on bended knee  sad featured image via mark wilson getty images
