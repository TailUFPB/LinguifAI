poverty is a moral failure  don t you know  being born rich is the only thing that washes away all sins  or is it that rich people are born without sin    at least that s the attitude of modern republicans  kentucky s governor  though  has a solution for that  like a child earning an allowance  governor matt bevin devised a chart where people can earn points with good behavior and those points would help them cover health care costs the plan  which sounds more like a virtual punch card you might use at a marriott  rather than one for attaining healthcare  is called  myrewards account   myrewards account is a list of hoops that poor people have to jump through before they earn enough points to get dental or eye exams  bevin is selling it as an expansion of benefits  when in reality  it s a humiliating way to make the most basic human right of healthcare as a carrot with a huge stick attached to it the biggest change is bevin s proposal to charge premiums for medicaid and impose an annual    deductible before the program covers beneficiaries  health care costs  those are big price hikes for people who can t afford them  similar policies have driven down insurance rates and harmed public health outcomes in other states already source  think progressthe plan would give petty sums of money to be used toward healthcare benefits that kentuckyians currently enjoy for doing things like try to find a job  when in fact  most medicaid recipients do have jobs  it also rewards people for not smoking or for having  no inappropriate er visits   you d better hope that isn t really indigestion before claiming you might be having a heart attack credit  kentucky health program requirements specificationobviously  this intrusive and completely unjust plan has more than a few critics  including anyone who cares at all about personal liberties  isn t that what these ayn rand humpers are all about   this requires building a massive database about people s individual behaviors  and then keeping it up  never mind that it s massively expensive  it also feels very invasive   former centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms  administrator andy slavitt said in an interview   i m not sure the government should be tracking if i put on five pounds  or if i m advancing in my job  or what grade i got on my ged exam  the party that doesn t seem concerned at all that their president hasn t even provided his tax returns see no hypocrisy in their insistence that the poor live under a microscope  the poor are not children who need constant suprevision  they are adults are deserve to be treated as such  remember  christians  jesus was poor featured image via scott olson getty images
