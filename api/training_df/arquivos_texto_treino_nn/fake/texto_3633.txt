there are all kinds of pushes designed to stop trump from officially taking office in january  there s a petition on change org with over four million signatures calling on electors to make hillary president  a recount effort is underway in three crucial battleground states  there are calls for investigations into his conflicts of interest  which could be unconstitutional and could prevent him from legally taking office and now  a group of electors has gotten together to start raising money for  a three week mad dash to stop donald trump s election   it s true that these are democratic electors  but their goal is to successfully lobby enough of their republican counterparts to put someone ahem sane into the white house the group is calling itself the hamilton electors  presumably after founding father alexander hamilton  hamilton described both the need and the purpose of the electoral college in  federalist no    as the following   affords a moral certainty  that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications  trump is eminently unqualified for the office of the president  and yet he won the necessary electoral votes  therefore  if we look at what hamilton said  our electors are obligated to reject donald trump and choose someone else it s not yet clear what the hamilton electors will actually do with the money they raise  but their endgame is clear  stop trump in any legal way possible  they have already registered a  non profit organization  and colorado democratic elector michael baca and his compatriots are looking to replace trump with a more mainstream republican wait  what  why a mainstream republican  because as much as it should go to hillary given the popular vote totals  the electors they have to convince to reject trump are never going to do it if their alternative is a democrat  and especially if it s hillary  a mainstream republican  such as john kasich  is an alternative that many republicans could probably get behind  this  however  means convincing democratic electors in addition to republican electors someone like kasich could do a lot to halt the progress we ve made over the last  years  but he s sane  at the very least  he also won t be flying off the handle on twitter at every single last perceived slight  he has his problems  but at least we can be reasonably sure the country will survive to see  under trump   there s a lot less of a guarantee  especially with congressional leaders signaling that they re ready to work with him  and  as some are pointing out  the electors have an obligation to ensure that we don t put a demagogue into the white house  and there is currently no law or precedent preventing the college from choosing its own candidate there have been no overt signs that republican electors will get behind the hamilton electors  however  the democratic coalition says they re getting through to at least some of them  even a split vote  where trump doesn t get  electoral votes on dec    might help because that would send it to congress and they d have the final say unfortunately  they d probably choose trump anyway if someone else  like kasich  mitt romney  or another mainstream republican managed to get  electoral votes  there would likely be some serious problems  that s particularly true for trump voters  the rnc  and congress  the chances that the hamilton electors will succeed in their efforts are slim  but at least we have a group in the electoral college that s trying featured image by drew angerer via getty images
