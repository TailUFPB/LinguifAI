the wall street journal is anything but liberal  and most of its columnists are likewise anything but liberal  but this not at all liberal publication does have writers  reporters and columnists who can see reality  and one sees the reality of trump s deteriorating mental state to the point where he actually called it out  yes  a wall street journal columnist literally went there on the state of trump s mind bret stephens  the columnist in question  asked twitter something interesting  when will republicans acknowledge that the president of the united states is mentally ill  he then linked to a wsj story about trump s latest tantrum  which includes accusing former president obama of wiretapping him during his campaign  he likened the activity to both watergate and mccarthyism  but failed to produce any evidence  it s illegal for the president of the united states to order wiretaps   in fact  the fisa court  which grants or denies warrants for just such surveillance  very likely would not go along with a presidential  order  to grant a warrant for tapping someone he also called obama a  bad  or sick  guy   for it how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    quickly drew the ire of republicans and democrats alike with that  and many are rightfully calling on him to produce his evidence or shut the fuck up  stephens  fed up  was essentially doing the same thing  but he caught a lot of flak for saying trump is mentally ill without a degree in psychology or evaluating trump himself  that perpetuates the stigma against mental illness because of that  he later deleted his tweet  but screencaps live forever  the truth is that we do need an answer about trump s state of mind soon  how stable is donald trump  his behavior does suggest a serious problem  there are any number of things that this could be  that may or may not be mental illness   but nobody can address this without knowing what it is featured image by jim lo scalzo via getty images
