donald trump has once again showed why he will only have white  male support  in a recent  shakeup  which entails  staying on script   the gop nominee made his much anticipated pitch to african american voters and just as one would expect  it went horribly  horribly wrong trump actually said no joking around   that black people should vote for him because they have nothing left to lose  what do you have to lose  you re living in poverty  your schools are no good  you have no jobs  fifty eight percent of your youth is unemployed  what do you have to lose  this speech was delivered in a community   lansing  michigan   which is  percent white and less than one percent black  if trump is serious about courting black voters and sympathizing with their struggles  he should go to harlem  chicago  new orleans  detroit  and other areas where the black population is at least above  percent after telling black voters that their livelihood sucks and that they all belong in low income socio economic conditions  trump made the bold prediction that he  with less than three months to go until election day  would win  percent of the black vote  the sheer arrogance and misguided gobbledygook espoused out of his mouth should alone be the disqualifying factor trump is polling at  percent with black voters  in less than three months  he s going to have to convince  percent of the black population he s  with  them  like everything else  trump is setting himself up for failure the man who has been sued for housing discrimination against blacks is now all of a sudden going to be their savior  just like middle class america s  the man who pointed to a random black man and screamed  look at my african american  is the one who will  produce  for the black community trump missed one very key  and detrimental  point in his speech  not every black person is in poverty  not every black person goes to a broken school  not every black person is unemployed  the dog whistle stereotypes that trump perpetuated were not meant to showcase black plight   it was political red meat for his racist base of support and to answer trump s question of  what do you have to lose   the answer is quite simple  everything with his candidacy breathing new life into the white nationalist movement  anybody who isn t a white  christian male has something to lose from a trump presidency  and that especially includes african americans the clinton campaign commented swiftly on trump s racist  offensive and misleading remarks  saying donald trump asks what the african american community has to lose by voting for him  the answer is everything from a man who questions the citizenship of the first african american president  courts white supremacists  and has been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color  trump painting the entire community as living in poverty with no jobs continues to show he is completely out of touch with the african american community trump may have just cemented his losing streak with black voters featured image via joe readle getty images
