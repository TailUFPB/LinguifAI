donald trump s muslim ban is proving to be a lot more difficult and a lot less constitutional than his followers hope  while two courts in a row have struck trump down  even mitch mcconnell is seeing the writing on the wall  he said on sunday that the senate will not defend trump s questionably constitutional muslim ban on cnn s state of the union  mcconnell was asked about a couple of trump s latest  including trump s defense of russian president vladimir putin s record of assassinating his political enemies  to which trump essentially shrugged his shoulders and said that the united states does it too  mcconnell called putin  a thug  and then  without a shred of irony in his voice  complained that putin wasn t legitimately elected the subject then turned to trump s claim that he only lost the popular vote because more than  million undocumented people voted  while mcconnell didn t exactly deny this baseless claim  he did say that  election fraud  wasn t significant enough to have swayed the election and that any investigations should be left up to the state then it turned to trump s latest priority  which is his muslim ban  while trump hasn t yet lashed out at the second court to put a halt to his ban  trump did have a twitter meltdown toward the first  who is a conservative george bush sr  appointee the opinion of this so called judge  which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country  is ridiculous and will be overturned   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    the ban was lifted by a judge  many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country  a terrible decision  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart  bad people are very happy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    s jake tapper asked mcconnell if congress would be willing to make the ban law  which would make the legality at least a bit less questionable  mcconnell wanted nothing to do with it  i don t know that that s necessary   mcconnell told cnn s jake tapper on  state of the union  sunday   i mean  the courts are going to decide whether the executive order the president issued is valid or not  and we all follow court orders  here s the video in its entirety mcconnell is sending a clear message to donald trump and it s one he won t like  even in our hyper partisan congress  mcconnell is not willing to step out on a political limb just because trump is a republican  this isn t exactly bravery on mcconnell s part  but it does show that perhaps impeachment might not be far behind  mcconnell would much rather work with a president mike pence featured image via video screen capture
