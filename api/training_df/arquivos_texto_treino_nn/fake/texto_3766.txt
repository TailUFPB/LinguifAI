the more unsavory people donald trump appoints  the angrier americans will get if trump truly wanted unity in the country he would not have appointed racists like steve bannon and jeff sessions to positions in his administration sessions  who once called the naacp  un american  while expressing his fondness of the kkk  is trump s pick to be the attorney general  who leads the justice department bannon s ties to white nationalists is also concerning since he is now trump s chief policy strategist and former general michael flynn and admirer of vladimir putin is now trump s national security adviser clearly  trump is placing insane right wing extremists in high government positions  which is only scaring millions of americans even more and even joe scarborough is getting concerned that if trump doesn t stop putting crazy people in positions of power that he s going to cause the country to have a  full blown meltdown  if you re going to get a couple loyalists that have said some crackpot things in the past  you better have some steady hands at state  at defense  and at treasury or this goes into a full blown meltdown   scarborough said during friday s edition of morning joe before adding that trump better  listen to them   too here s the video via youtube  scarborough s comments is at the   mark indeed  and seeing as how trump is meeting with mitt romney to discuss the secretary of state position  it sounds like trump may finally be ready to appoint a sane person to a key position  romney may be a flip flopper but he s way more moderate than trump or anyone else on his team and won t say or do things that pisses off the world also  as the morning joe panel pointed out  romney would be a voice of reason in an administration that is full of unreasonable people thus far the only question is whether trump would actually listen to anything romney has to say or will he just ignore romney in favor of the extremists around him featured image  screenshot
