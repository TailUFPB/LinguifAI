donald trump gave his first press conference since being elected today  he stood on that stage and told the american people yet again that mexico was going to pay for the wall he wants to build along our southern border  but at the same time  the president of mexico was insisting once more that they aren t paying for trump s stupid wall speaking to a group of mexico s ambassadors and consuls on wednesday  mexican president enrique pe a nieto said that mexico has  some differences with the next government of the united states  like the topic of the wall that mexico of course will not pay for  pe a nieto said that no matter what trump may say  mexico isn t going to foot the bill for the wall  he also said in no uncertain terms that mexico s  basic principles  and  sovereignty are simply  not negotiable  in addition  pe a nieto added that if there are to be any negotiations between the united states and mexico there has to be a concerted effort to stop the illegal arms and money that are flowing into mexico from the united states meanwhile  trump was saying this on live television  we re going to build a wall  i could wait about a year and a half until we start our negotiations with mexico   he said  but  i don t feel like waiting a year and a half  i want to get the wall started  i don t want wait a year and half to make a deal with mexico  trump now says that the american taxpayers are going to be the ones who will actually fund the building of the wall  but he says he has a great plan  the best plan  to bully mexico into paying us back trump has been told repeatedly that mexico is not going to pay for his wall  but he just can t seem to get that through his thick orange skull  he thinks he can bully anyone into anything  but it doesn t look like mexico is planning to bow down to trump anytime soon  and in case you didn t catch it  they most certainly aren t going to pay for that damn wall featured image via drew angerer getty images
