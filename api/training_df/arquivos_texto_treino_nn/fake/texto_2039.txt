donald trump at this point is known for spewing crazy statements  but in an interview with time  the donald somehow managed to outdo himself in attempting to defend some of his more batsh t insane lies asked about his claim that president obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at trump tower  the donald explained that he has  articles saying it happened   the random  word salady string of words trump threw together to support this one is so impressively moronic that sarah palin seems like a genius by comparison  no  i have  look  i have articles saying it happened  but you have to take a look at what they  they just went out at a news conference  devin nunes had a news conference  i mean i don t know  i was unable to see it  because i am at meetings  but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance  now again  it is in quotes  that means surveillance and various other things  and the new york times had a front page story  which they actually reduced  they took it  they took it the word wiretapping out of the title  but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping  and a lot of information has just been learned  and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time  we will see what happens  look  i predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of time  here  headline  for the front page of the new york times   wiretapped data used in inquiry of trump aides   that s a headline  now they then dropped that headline  i never saw this until this morning  they then dropped that headline  and they used another headline without the word wiretap  but they did mean wiretap  wiretapped data used in inquiry  then changed after that  they probably didn t like it  and they changed the title  they took the wiretap word out  devin nunes did indeed have a  news conference  in which he did attempt to push trump s lies by pointing out that many of the donald s associates had been caught up in perfectly legal  incidental collection  while the fbi and other agencies were looking into foreign suspects  nunes  a prominent member of trump s transition team  also completely skipped telling his fellow russia investigators of this development and ran directly to mr   with the information though nunes has previously said there is no evidence that obama  tapped  trump s  wires   the donald took the incidental collection of information   a term he admits he does not understand   as proof that he was correct about that dastardly president obama  well  he just got this information  this was new information  that was just got  members  of  let s see  were under surveillance during the obama administration following november s election  wow  this just came out  so  ah  just came out  trump also told time that he will be  proved right  about his wacky claim that three million undocumented immigrants voted for his opponent  swinging the popular vote in hillary clinton s favor  despite the completely false nature of trump s allegations  he says he s  forming a committee on it  and it may be  more than  three million   a  serious problem  asked about his completely unfounded claim that thousands of muslims celebrated in the streets of new jersey after    trump claimed that it was in the washington post  this claim has been disputed by literally everyone with any sense trump even defended his blatantly incorrect claim that ted cruz s father helped kill jfk by saying it was in a  newspaper   it wasn t  but that didn t stop him from lying again  well that was in a newspaper  no  no  i like ted cruz  he s a friend of mine  but that was in the newspaper  i wasn t  i didn t say that  i was referring to a newspaper  a ted cruz article referred to a newspaper story with  had a picture of ted cruz  his father  and lee harvey oswald  having breakfast  in fact  according to the donald  he is not responsible for any of his lies because someone else made the numerous false claims elsewhere and he simply repeated them  why do you say that i have to apologize  i m just quoting the newspaper  just like i quoted the judge the other day  judge napolitano  i quoted judge napolitano  just like i quoted bret baier  i mean bret baier mentioned the word wiretap  now he can now deny it  or whatever he is doing  you know  but i watched bret baier  and he used that term  i have a lot of respect for judge napolitano  and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right  i don t know where he has gone with it since then  but i m quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks  this is perhaps the most insane interview conducted with the president of the united states  you can read the whole thing here featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla
