donald trump threw a temper tantrum on saturday morning because states are refusing to cooperate with his bullshit  voter fraud  panel as you may recall  trump created the panel in response to losing the popular vote  which he insists he won because he claims nearly  million people voted  illegally  even republican secretaries of state know trump is full of shit  but that s not stopping him from pursuing an investigation anyway but so far  the panel has turned up nothing  that s because voter fraud is exceedingly rare in this country  in fact  the panel has so little to do that members are requesting that the panel take a look at russian interference in the  election  the same russian interference that helped trump win and as it turns out  states are not enthused about handing over voter information to a panel designed specifically to persecute people in fact   states are refusing to cooperate with the panel s request for the information according to the hill  a letter  signed by commission vice chairman and kansas secretary of state kris kobach  r   asked for names  addresses  birth dates and party affiliations of registered voters in each state  it also sought felony convictions  military statuses  the last four digits of social security numbers and voting records dating back to   that s a hell of a lot of information that most voters would see as a violation of privacy if the information were to be released  it seriously sounds like such information would be used to target democratic voters the refusal to cooperate sent trump into a hissy fit in which he actually had the gall to refer to the panel as  distinguished  and accused the  states of having something to hide  this coming from a man who is desperately trying to stop the russia investigation and has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished voter fraud panel  what are they trying to hide   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    users were quick to humiliate trump for this tweet trump thinks he could just add the word  distinguished  to a tweet and make it so  there is nothing distinguished about this panel  it s bs   theomnipotentjake   jakevandyne  july    one wants to give up their personal information to an incompetent government  nicetrytrump  val broeksmit   bikinirobotarmy  july    very distinguished  makes it sound like you are talking about a nigerian prince selling viagra via email   dani bostick   danibostick  july    verydistinguished like a pathetic man on a gold plated toilet  phone in hand   pepper   juliefromnc  july    are trying to keep your corrupt administration away from their voter data so you and putin can t do even more harm   khary penebaker   kharyp  july    how quickly republicans forget about states  rights when they control the federal government   tony webster   webster  july    do know that many republican controlled states are refusing to turn over data right   jonathan boucher   jonbouch  july    s panel is nothing more than a joke designed to stroke his own ego  he lost the popular vote by nearly  million votes  he s a loser and he needs to get over it featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
