donald trump once said that he loves  the poorly educated   and he skips his intelligence briefings regularly  so it is reasonable to assume that he is not a fan of  intelligence  in any form  but on thursday  the donald took to twitter to assure everyone that this isn t true   and to backtrack on his agreements with julian assange so fast that one is forced to wonder what information he learned about russia s hack of the election in the past  hours  the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange   wrong  i simply state what he states  it is for the people   trump tweeted  apparently forgetting that his vapid  meth addled nazi followers prefer him to use the word l genpresse   to make up their own minds as to the truth  the media lies to make it look like i am against  intelligence  when in fact i am a big fan the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange   wrong  i simply state what he states  it is for the people    donald j

realdonaldtrump  january    hacked emails were not just distributed by assange  who is currently hiding out from rape charges in an embassy  but by  guccifer    and  dc leaks  as well   two web sites run by actual  bona fide  russian agents  nevertheless  though he admits he doesn t look into who gives him information  assange claims that he didn t receive the emails  from russia   on wednesday  trump mindlessly parroted the claim because it supports his nonsensical decision to spend every waking moment doing the twitter equivalent of dropping to his knees in front of putin and  well  you get the idea in his nonsensical morning tweet  wednesday edition  trump informed the world that his  intelligence   yes  he put the word in quotes again  had been delayed by a few days and attacked  intelligence agencies   he could have meant any of the more than a bakers  dozen who say that russia absolutely hacked us  and putin led the operation  but he seems to mean the cia   this was a lie he followed that up by spreading assange s nonsensical claim that their friend vladdy poot didn t give him the information and by attacking the dnc for getting hacked but even though the donald regularly tweets out agreements with assange   including the false claim that russia had nothing to do with the hack  something he would know if he actually attended intelligence briefings    he says his tweets should not be construed as agreement with the sexual predator behind the release of some of the hacked documents russian hackers stole  naturally  twitter stepped in and did the online equivalent of beating trump with a broom handle  realdonaldtrump only you would use  intelligence  in quotes as if it s always theoretical  pic twitter com   kristina wong   mskristinawong  january

january     in   trump didn t agree with assange so much as he wanted to have him murdered  you see  before russia and wikileaks teamed up to hack and release information about his opponent in what the intelligence community agrees was an effort to install him in office  the donald said that assange is  disgraceful  and that  there should be like death penalty or something  for his new rapist friend putin  on the other hand  trump has just always loved  a few years back  the donald tweeted that he hopes the brutal russian dictator becomes his  new best friend  it s nice that we re all friends now  and that assange and trump are bonding over the  dishonest press   but if trump is getting his  intelligence  from russia and some rapist  it s time we talk about peacefully removing him from the white house and   what was that thing he wanted to do to his opponent  who had legitimately not committed a crime  oh  yes   locking him up  featured image via getty images  christopher
