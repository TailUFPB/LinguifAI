keith olbermann doesn t mince words  and when it comes to donald trump  he doesn t just avoid mincing words  he lights into him  trump and his minions keep saying that the muslim ban is necessary to protect us from terrorism  a lawyer from the department of justice even made that claim in court and got promptly smacked down by the judge  olbermann took to his show   the resistance   to flay trump open again over the effects of his racist ban first off  olbermann says that trump is aiding our enemies with the ban  and indeed  he is  the first  perhaps the only international organization of any kind to congratulate trump on his muslim ban in sheep s clothing was so called islamic state  isis  the terrorists  it sent him no bouquets  it issued no press releases  it did not have to  it has been celebrating him and this plan  which will almost certainly instigate the deaths of american citizens since the night of the election  trump is alienating muslims  making people in america fear muslims  and that makes muslim americans ripe for radicalization  it also pisses off muslims elsewhere and makes them ripe for radicalization  but olbermann postulates that this might be what trump wants  since  is the greatest possible gift to isis for recruitment  for confirmation  for rationalization  for instigating terrorist acts  maybe here in america  it must either be that trump does not understand what will almost inevitably follow  or that he does understand what will almost inevitably follow  why would an american want that  not an american president  why would any american deliberately do anything to give terrorists a rationalization to commit terrorism in america  well  olbermann says if we look back to the bush administration following sept    they used that as an excuse to attack iraq  as well as to roll back privacy laws and other freedoms in the name of keeping  the homeland  safe  sowing fear to justify all of that  of course  was how republicans kept their hold on the white house in  after explaining all that  olbermann paints a possible  and terrifying  motive for trump instigating terrorist attacks  watch the whole episode below blaming a judge for a hypothetical terror attack  when he is doing the recruiting work for isis  the threat is trump pic twitter com lsgcrtrglh  keith olbermann   keitholbermann  february    image via screen capture from embedded video
