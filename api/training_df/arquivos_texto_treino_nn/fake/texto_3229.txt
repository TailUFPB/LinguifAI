kellyanne conway is not taking russian interference in our political process seriously  so cnn host kate bolduan called her out for it during an interview on thursday night  bolduan asked conway about donald trump s reaction to president obama slapping sanctioned against russia  including the expulsion of  russian diplomats  in retaliation for hacking the dnc and meddling in the election on trump s behalf trump insisted that we move on and blamed computers instead of the russians for the attack because  computers have complicated our lives greatly  conway  as usual  brushed off the question and began whining about the new york times and hillary clinton all while once again claiming that trump won a huge victory  she also accused president obama of hitting the russians with sanctions as a political maneuver against trump let s not forget that clinton won the popular vote and trump electoral win is one of the smallest margins of victory in the last  years but while president obama s actions against russia may make it harder for trump to kiss putin s ass  it s hardly politically motivated  the cia and  other intelligence agencies agree that russia interfered in our election  and there needed to be consequences because trump sure as hell was not going to do anything about it himself conway  however  continued her obsession with talking about hillary clinton to dodge bolduan s questions and whined about people questioning trump s legitimacy  which forced bolduan to call conway out for not taking the russian hacking seriously  this is serious   bolduan said   this is about a foreign country hacking into the united states electoral process  regardless  it doesn t even have to do with the result  even  it is more that they tried to and did  conway replied by blaming the dnc for the hack instead of the russians who did the hacking and then proceeded to accuse the intelligence community of trying to interfere with the election results here s the video via youtube it sure sounds like there will be a lot of friction between trump s team and the intelligence community  and frankly  they should tell trump he s on his own  because you know he s going to blame them for whatever happens anyway featured image via screenshot
