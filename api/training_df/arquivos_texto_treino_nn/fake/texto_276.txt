some are saying that trump has not botched the relief effort in puerto rico  newsflash  he s botched it horribly   but even if that were true  he s doing worse than botching the pr for it  hurricane maria hit puerto rico on sept    on the   he decided to go golfing for four days  and rage tweeted at the nfl the whole time  then he rage tweeted at the  ingrates  in puerto rico who aren t showing him the proper appreciation for what he s not doing  today  he was at the presidents cup golf tournament  avoiding real work and participating in the trophy presentation instead and while he was there  he decided to dedicate the trophy to the victims of hurricanes harvey  irma and maria  according to steve kopack of cnbc  trump said that conditions in texas  florida and puerto rico are  really under control   and that he was dedicating the trophy to victims of storms for those asking  president trump was speaking on  golfchannel s coverage of the presidents cup trophy presentation   steve kopack   stevekopack  october    are his own words  on behalf of all of the people of texas  and all of the people   if you look today and see what is happening  how horrible it is but we have it under really great control   puerto rico and the people of florida who have really suffered over this last short period of time with the hurricanes  i want to just remember them and we re going to dedicate this trophy to all of those people that went through so much that we love   a part of our great state  really part of our great nation  because a trophy is seriously what they need right now  forget disaster relief funds  forget personnel and equipment  forget food  water and medicine  forget restoring electricity and communications  what they really need a participation trophy  which is what this amounts to for all the good it ll do the relief effort is disastrously inadequate in puerto rico  where people are starting to suffer from dengue fever  viral conjunctivitis and zika  they re at increasing risk for cholera due to the lack of clean drinking water  in fact  the number of people without access to clean drinking water has shot from  percent to  percent between wednesday and yesterday  and will continue to rise until we actually get our butts moving with the relief effort there furthermore  the contaminated floodwaters are putting puerto ricans at risk for hepatitis a  meningitis and salmonella  even if they don t drink it this isn t just a meaningless gesture  it s damned insulting  you don t dedicate a goddamn trophy  presented at a tournament full of wealthy people who are safe in their well moneyed cocoons  to hurricane victims  you just don t  it wouldn t be surprising to start hearing more outcry from homeless  sick  and suffering puerto ricans   people who are already angry at the lack of response from trump s administration and his characterization of them as lazy all over twitter featured image via elsa getty images
