nobody can accuse fox news of being sane most of the time  particularly when it comes to some of their talk shows  take fox   friends  for instance  their hosts have extremely poor analytical skills and extreme conservative tunnel vision  but they press on with their bullshit anyway  today is the  anniversary of the sept   attacks  so fox   friends is talking about it  but they obviously can t do it without politicizing it  and they ve done so in an extremely disgusting way they voiced their problems with the ongoing removal of confederate statues from public spaces  and decided to try and appeal to people s emotions about them by complaining that  once liberals are done removing confederate statues  they ll go after things like   memorial statues and monuments no  really  they did that speaking to interior secretary ryan zinke  who was talking about the memorial of united flight  on the show  host brian kilmeade actually asked this question  do you worry that  years from now someone is going to take that memorial down like they are trying remake our memorials today  because the people who stopped terrorists from flying flight  to its target are totally the same thing as people who advocated for the continued ownership of african american  of fellow human beings  the passengers on that plane died intentionally to prevent further tragedy  the confederacy sought to preserve a tragedy that had already endured for thousands of years big difference  guys and a horrifically insulting and inappropriate comparison to boot  kilmeade might as well have tried to claim that the passengers of flight  acted out of a desire to see the terrorists win  zinke seemed uncomfortable with the question and tried to stumble his way out of it  and ultimately failed  i m one who believes  you know  that we should learn from history  and i think our monuments are a part of our country s history  since we don t put up statues of jesus  everyone is going to fall morally short  i think reflecting on our history  both good and bad  is a powerful statement and part of our dna  i m an advocate  again  of learning from our monuments  understanding the period they were made  he ended with saying that  regardless of our differences  whether we re republican or democrat  monuments are a tribute to all of us oh  please  just when we thought the entire administration had hit bottom  we find yet another freaking shovel with an order to start digging again  zinke s complicit in this vile comparison now  watch the entire shameful exchange below featured image via video screen capture
