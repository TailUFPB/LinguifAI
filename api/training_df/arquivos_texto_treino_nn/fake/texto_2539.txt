michael flynn s sudden resignation in the wake of a growing scandal that he was in contact with russia over the sanctions we slapped on them probably surprised absolutely no one   except perhaps those who think donald trump is perfect  flynn recently admitted that he  may have  discussed those sanctions with russia  and then  with the news that the justice department had already warned the trump administration about him  everything just blew up fox news  of all outlets  published his resignation letter in its entirety  and it s not the letter of someone who knows he screwed up  it s the letter of someone who s still hoping that the white house will give him some favorable treatment  it s the letter of someone who s sucking up majorly in the wake of his fuck up it s the letter of someone who won t admit he was wrong in any way  shape or form  after claiming that his talks with russia and other countries were simply to make the transition of power as smoothly as possible  he said  unfortunately  because of the fast pace of events  i inadvertently briefed the vice president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the russian ambassador  i have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president  and they have accepted my apology  leave out the  fast pace of events   and  i inadvertently   and you ve got an admission of wrongdoing  otherwise  he s basically saying   yeah  i lied  but it wasn t my fault i lied  then he says it s been his honor to serve the american people  in such a distinguished way   after talking about his  integrity  in performing his duties throughout a  year long military career  his career is distinguished  yes  but it s been forever tarnished by his behavior  even if he isn t willing to acknowledge that in his resignation the end of the letter  though  is nothing but one big  long  sloppy kiss on trump s ass  i am also extremely honored to have served president trump  who in just three weeks  has reoriented american foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore america s leadership position in the world as i step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity  i wish to thank president trump for his personal loyalty  the friendship of those who i worked with throughout the hard fought campaign  the challenging period of transition  and during the early days of his presidency i know with the strong leadership of president donald j  trump and vice president mike pence and the superb team they are assembling  this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in u s  history  and i firmly believe the american people will be well served as they all work together to help make america great again  yeah  that really sounds like he s hoping they ll give him some kind of favorable treatment down the road instead of cutting him loose and disavowing him  or something  it is  in its way  a good resignation letter  but it just reeks of ass kissing and  this wasn t my fault  flynn is  we hope  just the first domino to fall in a corrupt administration that s intent on selling us out to one of our greatest enemies  goodbye  and good riddance  sir  read his full letter here featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
