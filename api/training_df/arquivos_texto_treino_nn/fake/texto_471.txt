remember how sarah palin sued the new york times for mistakenly saying that a concrete link had been established between her facebook post that featured crosshairs over former arizona congresswoman gabrielle giffords  district and jared loughner s decision to open fire on her  well  that didn t work out so well  don t retreat  reload   palin famously posted on facebook along with an image depicting gun sights over various states whose legislators she was  targeting   shortly after  loughner shot giffords in the head and pumped bullets into numerous others  killing six and wounding thirteen others no concrete link between the two has been established   though it is reasonable to assume palin s encouragement played a role in the shooting speaking of shooting  district judge jed rakoff  shot down palin s frivolous lawsuit against the times on tuesday  nowhere is political journalism so free  so robust or  perhaps  so rowdy as in the united states    judge rakoff wrote in his  page decision  but if political journalism is to achieve its constitutionally endorsed role of challenging the powerful  legal redress by a public figure must be limited to those cases where the public figure has a plausible factual basis for complaining that the mistake was made maliciously  what we have here is an editorial  written and rewritten rapidly in order to voice an opinion on an immediate event of importance  in which are included a few factual inaccuracies somewhat pertaining to mrs  palin that are very rapidly corrected   rakoff wrote  negligence this may be  but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not  judge rakoff s opinion is an important reminder of the country s deep commitment to a free press and the important role that journalism plays in our democracy   a spokeswoman for the times said   we regret the errors we made in the editorial  but we were pleased to see that the court acknowledged the importance of the prompt correction we made once we learned of the mistakes  this is  of course  bad news for palin and her ally donald trump  who wants to  open up  libel laws to make it easier to people like palin to file frivolous lawsuits against journalistic institutions for every little mistake even if a correction has been made lately  the right has been practically masturbating over the idea of bullying anyone who reports something they don t like with expensive lawsuits as an attempt to keep criticism to a minimum this is bad news for anyone who has recently filed a frivolous lawsuit against journalists  including  alt right   a term employed by nazis as a form of rebranding  journalist cassandra fairbanks  who sued a fusion reporter for correctly reporting that she had made a hand gesture that had been adopted by the  white power  movement during a visit to the white house fortunately  judge rakoff  refused to allow palin s farcical lawsuit to get off the ground  hopefully  this sends a message to the right that bullying journalists with lawsuits will not go well for them featured image via screengrab
