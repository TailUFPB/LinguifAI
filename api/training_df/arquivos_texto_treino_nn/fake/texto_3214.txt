cnn host kate bolduan sat quietly as a conservative radio host lied his ass off during an interview and then humiliated him so bad he was nearly speechless on friday  jan chamberlin released a statement announcing her resignation from the mormon tabernacle choir she loved for many years  i have highly valued the mission of the choir to be good will ambassadors for christ  to share beautiful music and to give hope  inspiration  and comfort to others   she wrote  explaining why she refuses to sing for donald trump on inauguration day  i ve tried to tell myself that it will be alright and that i can continue in good conscience before god and man  but it s no use  i simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events  i could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect  i also know  looking from the outside in  it will appear that choir is endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man  tyranny is now on our doorstep   she continued   i only know i could never  throw roses to hitler   and i certainly could never sing for him  predictably  conservatives threw a collective hissy fit and have sent threats and hateful messages to chamberlin and right wing radio host ben ferguson threw his own temper tantrum on live television ferguson smeared chamberlin as a hypocrite and claimed that she sang with the choir at president obama s inauguration  and viciously criticized her throughout his rant  was the choir endorsing abortion when they sang when barack obama was inaugurated   he began   because he s in favor of abortion  i think that would be something  obviously  she just stepped out from if she s going to claim this holy high ground now  this is nothing but a grandstanding individual who doesn t get her way so she says i m going to walk away  there are  people in the choir  not all are going to be traveling  more importantly than that when it comes to religion you would think she may actually want to have influence over people that are about to run the government and have peace and harmony which is what the tabernacle choir claims to be about  this is nothing but self righteous grandstanding from a crybaby who never grew up  and guess what  not everyone believes everything you believe in  it seemed like bolduan had just let ferguson get away with slandering chamberlin and the mormon tabernacle choir  in fact  the segment continued as symone sanders defended chamberlin against ferguson s attack but his blatant lie remained unchallenged but at the end of the segment  bolduan finally pounced and informed ferguson that the mormon tabernacle choir never actually performed at president obama s inauguration clearly busted  all ferguson could manage to utter was   well  there you go  here s the video via youtube it s not enough to call out lies  it s time to punish pundits who blatantly lie on the air like ferguson did  facts matter and if we want to make sure facts continue to matter  we need to pressure the media to keep people who lie off the air  if they can t be bothered to tell the truth  they have no business being given a platform to spread their bullshit featured image via screenshot
