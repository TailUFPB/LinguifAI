trump s loyalty to vladimir putin is being tested like never before  on one hand the donald really wants a war with north korea  on the other  both russia and china have told him to back the f ck off   and the associated press reports that these warnings are becoming more forceful after trump s navy sent a destroyer into the korean peninsula china and russia have dispatched intelligence gathering vessels from their navies to chase the uss carl vinson nuclear powered aircraft carrier  which is heading toward waters near the korean peninsula  multiple sources of the japanese government revealed to the yomiuri shimbun it appears that both countries aim to probe the movements of the united states  which is showing a stance of not excluding military action against north korea  the self defense forces are strengthening warning and surveillance activities in the waters and airspace around the area  according to the sources china and russia  which prioritize stability in the korean peninsula  showed concern over the tough u s  stance  with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the issue should be resolved peacefully through political and diplomatic efforts the dispatch of the intelligence gathering vessels appears to be partly aimed at sending a warning signal to the united states recently  donald trump stopped calling china a  currency manipulator  after his companies were granted  lucrative trademarks in the country  including for an escort service   as for russia  we all know what putin s people did for the donald at this point  it is surprising that the united states has any allies left given how trump has treated them  and countries like russia and china with whom we enjoy a shaky relationship at best  especially when the former recently committed numerous acts of war against the u s  during the election   and trump is testing our bonds with every single friend and frenemy we have as trump pushes us toward war with north korea  he fails to consider that both russia and china are likely to step in if he goes all rambo on the tiny island dictatorship featured image via screengrab
