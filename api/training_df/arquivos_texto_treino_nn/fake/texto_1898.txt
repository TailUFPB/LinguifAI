fox news is now probably regretting their decision to keep bill o reilly instead of megyn kelly earlier this week  it was revealed that bill o reilly and the conservative network have paid off several women to stave off sexual harassment lawsuits in all  five women have been paid   million of what amounts to hush money to stop them from publicly hauling o reilly s ass to court for years  o reilly s behavior toward his female colleagues at fox has drawn criticism and outrage  especially since he remains employed by the network o reilly and fox previously settled a lawsuit filed by former fox host juliet huddy and a lawsuit filed by andrea tantaros is still ongoing  the worst part of my job is being a target for those who would harm me and my employer  the fox news channel   o reilly pathetically claimed in his defense after the new revelations came to light o reilly is trying to portray himself as the victim  but if that were true he would have fought the charges in court to clear his name rather than pay the women off fox news recently renewed o reilly s contract because his show makes the network a lot of money  but that is all changing now because advertisers are dumping o reilly according to cnn mercedes benz  hyundai  bmw of north america  constant contact  ainsworth pet nutrition  untuckit and sanofi are pulling ads from  the o reilly factor  in a statement  hyundai said they would rather seek partnerships with companies that don t condone sexual harassment we had upcoming advertising spots on the show but are reallocating them due to the recent and disturbing allegations  as a company we seek to partner with companies and programming that share our values of inclusion and diversity  we will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation as we plan future advertising decisions mercedes benz said the same thing the allegations are disturbing and  given the importance of women in every aspect of our business  we don t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now in addition  lexus and jenny craig appear to be leaning toward also removing their ads from o reilly s show since they have condemned sexual harassment and promised to monitor the story as it unfolds o reilly may be fox s cash cow but if more companies pull advertising money from his show they will likely be forced to reexamine his worth to the company  after all  fox news has spent millions of dollars paying off his victims and paying legal expenses  if the company starts losing millions of dollars from advertisers they ll have to conclude that o reilly is too much of a financial liability to the company to keep around any longer and that could finally put an end to the career of one of the most sexist and racist loudmouths in all of cable news history featured image  screenshot
