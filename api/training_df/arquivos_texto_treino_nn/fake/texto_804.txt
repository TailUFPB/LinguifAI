as donald trump s legal team tries to dig up leverage to use against investigators and researches his pardon power  kellyanne conway is busy smearing anyone who is involved in the investigation the russia investigation has been heating up in recent days as more information continues to be revealed about trump jr s secret meeting with russians and special prosecutor robert mueller and his team start looking at trump s family finances  which will likely reveal all of trump shady connections and dealings with russian oligarchs obviously  trump is very nervous about mueller s investigation  he even warned mueller not to look at his business dealings  which basically gave mueller a reason to look there during an appearance on fox   friends on friday  conway began laying the groundwork for trump to have an excuse to fire mueller and derail the investigation against him she began by whining about how taxpayers are funding the investigation  which is hypocritical considering republicans wasted millions of taxpayer dollars investigation benghazi  a real witch hunt that lasted longer than even the   investigation  where is this going   conway whined   are americans comfortable with that  with the taxpayers funding this with this going off of all types of chutes and ladders  then she accused mueller and his team of being democrats and hillary clinton partisans  not only did these democrat  presumably  lawyers donate a lot of money to the left side of the political aisle  one of them actually was a lawyer for the clinton foundation   conway said of course  trump ass kisser steve doocy jumped in to claim that there are all sorts of conflicts of interest and that members of mueller s team should be forced to resign conway then launched a rant about how the  swamp  is out to get trump and stop him from bringing  transparency  and  accountability  to washington even though trump has never been transparent and has never held himself accountable for anything he has ever said or done  steve  here s the relevance of that   people should at least know it  donald trump went to washington to disrupt and expose the system  just to blow that secret door off of its hinges and have more accountability and transparency in a system that thrives on the opposite  so the same applies here  let s at least  you know  you re saying put on pressure   let s have a disinfectant  let s at least let the transparency and accountability speak for itself  it s relevant that people know what the motivations are  and that is not an attack on the team  that is what s fair is fair  seriously she then went on to accuse top democratic members of the house and senate investigations of spending more time on television than in hearings here s the video via fox news if donald trump fires mueller he would be obstructing an investigation and telling the world that he has something to hide that he doesn t want investigators to find  he would basically be admitting that he s guilty  of course  if trump truly believed in accountability and transparency  he would admit that his campaign colluded with russia and resign immediately featured image  screenshot
