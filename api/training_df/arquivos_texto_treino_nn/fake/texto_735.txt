donald trump s approval rating continues to plummet in its downward spiral  and it seems to be getting lower by the week  the latest bad news for the man baby in the white house will be that more americans disapprove of trump s job performance than approve in  states across the country  here s the real kicker   this includes  states that he d actually won in november it turns out  not even trump s most supportive audiences are willing to stand by him after watching him try to burn our country to the ground on a weekly basis  the states that have changed their minds about trump include pennsylvania  wisconsin  michigan and florida  ohio  iowa  north carolina  georgia  arizona   and two states that shocked everyone   indiana and texas you can check out how the states are rating trump below trump has been setting records left and right during his presidency   and almost   of it is negative  over the last three months  gallup noted that the disgraceful potus  approval rating   percent  has set records lows for a president in his second quarter when many of those states might have supported trump last year  it seems they re running in the opposite direction now  in texas and indiana  there is now a major difference between the states  approval of trump in november  and how the american people feel about him now  for example  in indiana  where vice president mike pence hails from   trump had won that state by  points in november  less than a year later  he is now one point underwater  in texas  trump had won by nine points last year  now  he s nine points under in that state this is not looking good for trump at all  as he is consistently failing in each of these once pro trump states what this tells us is that even trump s supporters are getting tired of his bullsh t and are regretful that they didn t put their vote behind a real presidential candidate  any republican who wanted to give trump the benefit of the doubt is certainly having second thoughts now to a normal leader  this would be devastating  any respectable president would be panicking and consumed with how they are going to turn this around  but not trump  last week  trump said that his ridiculously low approval rating of almost  percent was  not bad at this time    even though he d set a record low featured image via win mcnamee getty images
