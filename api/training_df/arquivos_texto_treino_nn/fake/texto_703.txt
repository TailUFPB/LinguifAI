rep  steve king  r iowa  is the most insane if not the most offensive of all of the knuckle dragging republicans in congress  so it makes sense that he s a fan of donald trump  he is scrambling so hard to cover trump s alleged crimes that he s made a pledge to waste taxpayer money investigating pretty much everyone who s identified as a democrat in a press release  king called for investigating president obama  hillary  and probably bill  clinton  james comey  george soros  loretta lynch  my fingers are getting tired   huma abedin and anthony weiner king  who is a proud white supremacist  as seen in this video  argued that obama should be investigated because he interfered with an election in israel  that was a debunked conspiracy theory he also wants liberal bogey man who most liberals have never heard of  george soros investigated for a russian based conspiracy theory saying soros funded election manipulation in the balkans he wants to investigate huma abedin and anthony weiner for improper use of classified emails  even the right wing blog the blaze admits that that s  to quote trumpsters  a nothing burger of course  he wants to open the gazillionth investigation into hillary clinton s emails  something she s been exonerated for multiple times then there s loretta lynch  who happened to talk to bill clinton on a tarmac  that has to mean something unseemly was happening  right  by the way  even if it was somehow an attempt to sway the election  it didn t work  but it did cause james comey to go public with hillary s emails  which surely helped her lose the election  despite it also being a  nothing burger  and then there s comey  who apparently didn t try hard enough to make clinton lose the election that she won lost none of the people king wants to investigate currently hold a political office  yet he wants to continue beating a dead horse to keep eyes off the real  and possibly treasonous  scandals in washington featured image via scott olson getty images
