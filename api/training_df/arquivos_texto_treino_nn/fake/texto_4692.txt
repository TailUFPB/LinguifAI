the gop has  more or less  gotten into the habit of putting forth lukewarm defenses of donald trump and his many ahem problems  or just staying silent altogether  they re more vocal in their opposition to hillary  however  her running mate  tim kaine  has senate republicans in an uproar   because they love him and believe they can actually work with him  kaine is something of a throwback to a chummier era of senate politics   says politico on this story  they mean that his ways of working are a throwback to a time before toxic  extremist tea party politics began eating the entire republican party from the inside out  like really nasty parasites that eventually kill their hosts  senate republicans are hoping that he ll use his relationships and ability to work with them as an asset should hillary get elected and their praise is pretty lavish  particularly for the opposing vp candidate at the height of a presidential election cycle  politico spoke to a dozen gop senators about this  sen  bob corker  r tn   who serves with kaine on the senate foreign relations committee  said  he understands the issues  he cares about having an outcome and i think he could be very effective with working with people here  susan collins  r me   who admittedly can be a bit more moderate than many of her colleagues  said  if we do end up having hillary as our president   he will be a good influence as far as relationships with congress   and getting away from the incivility that has marred the past decade  sen  jeff flake  r az  has made no secret of the fact that he can t vote for trump  and he s said he won t vote for hillary  either  however  he  too  sees kaine as an asset to hillary  i don t know anybody on the republican side who has a bad thing to say about him  he doesn t go out of his way to go after people politically and he s all about policy  flake also said  i m not going to concede the election  but if he s in that position then hillary clinton will be well served  sen  john cornyn  r tx  seems to like that kaine is playing up democratic policy proposals rather than attacking incumbent republicans while stumping for them in battleground states  i haven t seen anything yet that he s done  that would damage his ability to work with republicans  and lindsey graham  r sc   said of kaine awhile back  tim would be a good steady hand for   he d be well received on our side of the aisle if he s an emissary from the president  sens  john mccain  r az  and lamar alexander  r tn  both praised his bipartisanism  hell  even the north carolina republican party gave him an unqualified apology after mistaking a blue star service pin  which he wears to honor his son on active duty  for the flag of honduras and posting about it on twitter there are parts of the gop that would have just quietly deleted that tweet and hoped the outrage would quickly die  lest they appear to actually  gasp   respect a democrat it will likely be up to the senate to try to pull the house in line should hillary get elected  house conservatives  unsatisfied with the previous eleventy thousand investigations against hillary  are talking about launching another one in a desperate and sorry attempt to find something on her that means they can unequivocally work against her  and thus  america  because reasons with the strong possibility that kaine can broker more bipartisan legislation and improve relations between democrats and republicans in the senate  though  then there s a slight possibility that the house may eventually fall in line  when the senate sends bipartisan legislation over to the house that they won t even look at  they look like the sulky  peevish little kids who can t play nice that they are kaine could easily be the direct line to senate republicans that hillary needs to actually get stuff done  and senate republicans are loving it featured image by justin sullivan getty images
