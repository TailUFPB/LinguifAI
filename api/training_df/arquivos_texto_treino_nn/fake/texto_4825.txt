donald trump has a new fundraising scheme  he s raffling off lunch with his son eric and a tour of the trump campaign headquarters  while this is pretty standard political fundraising fare  it does show how ridiculous and disingenuous trump s latest attacks against hillary clinton actually are the latest  revelation  about clinton is that as secretary of state  she sometimes held meetings with donors to the clinton foundation  she also often ignored the requests for meetings  which is completely overlooked by the right wing press trump has taken the report and run with it  calling it  pay to play   and noting that it s illegal  a couple of very bad ones came out  and it s called pay for play   he said   and some of these were really  really bad and illegal  if it s true  it s illegal  you re paying and you re getting things  source  politico paying and getting things   isn t illegal  that s called capitalism  paying government officials to get things that only government officials can give   that s called pay to play and yes  that is illegal  there s no evidence that hillary clinton did that  unless you count an occasional meeting as  getting things   ask absolutely anyone in hollywood what a meeting means  hell  ask donald trump what a meeting means  and you d find that with successful people  a meeting is as much a way of shutting people up as it is an exchange of ideas  let alone favors  meetings never have and never will imply obligation now  let s talk about actual pay to play  the highly illegal type  donald trump has actually bragged about bribing politicians and judges  that s unethical at best and illegal at worst  i was a businessman   trump smarmed at a debate earlier this year  he was being pressed about the piles of dough he has deposited in democratic coffers through the years   for his pals the clintons  including the clinton ca ching foundation   schumer  reid  pelosi  cuomo  rahm  and the rest of the gang  i give to everybody  when they call  i give  you know what  when i need something from them  two years later  three years later  i call them  and they are there for me        and that s a broken system  source  national reviewyes  that is a broken system   one trump is happy to keep broken oh  but it gets worse  trump also allegedly bribes people  as he allegedly bribed people involved in the trump university case the trouble started in june  when the associated press reported that bondi  personally solicited a political contribution from donald trump  in  right around the time she was deciding whether or not to investigate alleged fraud at trump university  trump university  of course  is the controversial for profit school owned by presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump it was only four days after bondi announced she might join an investigation into trump university when a trump family foundation gave    to a political group supporting bondi s re election  after that money came in  bondi said she would not pursue a lawsuit against trump university  two years later one day before florida s crucial primary election bondi endorsed trump for president source  think progressthat  if it happens as alleged  is pay to play  holding meetings with donors is not  whether the meeting is with secretary clinton or eric trump featured image via alex wong getty images
