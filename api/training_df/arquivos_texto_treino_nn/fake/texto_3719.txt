one of donald trump s biggest ideas and a way he hopes to peel off support from some democrats is to propose a big infrastructure bill  trump and his team believe that positioning infrastructure as an investment in america that would also employ people will get democrats to budge but senator bernie sanders  i vt  is now loudly pointing out that the trump infrastructure idea is just another in his long line of  scam  proposals bernie sanders called donald trump s infrastructure plan a  scam  that only helps large companies and wall street billionaires on monday trump s plan gives giant tax credits for private companies that invest in projects  lowering the cost of financing the project significantly  sanders took issue with the tax loopholes afforded by the plan  trump would allow corporations that have stashed their profits overseas to pay just a fraction of what the companies owe in federal taxes   he wrote   and then he would allow the companies to  invest  in infrastructure projects in exchange for even more tax breaks  trump s plan is corporate welfare coming and going  other influential voices like new york times columnist paul krugman have also pointed out the attempt at graft and greed that would no doubt be present in a trump infrastructure proposal democrats hoping to regain power will be tested to stand up to attempts to schmooze them from trump and a compliant media eager to give the incoming president a  win   they hope to maintain opposition to trump in the same manner that republicans in the house and senate have refused to work with president obama since they took power some conservative democrats have indicated that they want to consider trump s proposals  that includes sen  jon tester  mt  and sen  joe manchin  wv   but both men come from states that went heavily for trump and a lot of their rhetoric can be chalked up more to craven politics and fear of the right wing than actual principles and values featured image via flickr
