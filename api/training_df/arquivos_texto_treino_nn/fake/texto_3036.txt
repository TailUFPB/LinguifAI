in a bit of irony  the inspector general  who investigated clinton s use of a private email server  will now be conducting an investigation of james comey and the fbi to determine if the damaging letter sent to the house oversight committee in october of last year was mishandled and unfairly influential some outlets  including fivethirtyeight  vox and al jazeera  contend that comey s letter inflicted a fatal blow to the clinton campaign in the last week of the election  allowing donald trump to clinch a surprise win the justice department and inspector general s office say that the move comes as pressure mounts from members of congress and the public that the releasing of the letter was politically motivated and intended to hurt the clinton campaign michael horowitz  the inspector general  also said the fbi would be focused on a slew of other issues pertaining to the email controversy  including if any members of the doj gave information to the campaign and if an agent  whose wife was running for congress on the democratic ticket  should have recused himself from the initial email investigation horowitz also told ranking members of congressional committees that the incoming investigation will not change the outcome of the initial clearance of hillary clinton of any criminal wrongdoing  and that the white house had no role in pressuring for the incoming probe the inspector general also did not say how long said probe would take to complete perhaps justice will be served   although the election cannot be undone   comey will resign in shame  and hillary clinton will once again be vindicated in the court of public opinion  that is  everyone will see that trump was illegitimately elected and thus is an illegitimate president james comey single handedly had the biggest influence on the outcome of the election  he arrogantly told members of the senate intelligence committee that he cannot comment on a pending investigation  for which independent senator angus king rightfully called him out for it if that s comey s contention  then the probe will most likely prove as fatal to his career as it did to hillary clinton s featured image via alex wong getty images
