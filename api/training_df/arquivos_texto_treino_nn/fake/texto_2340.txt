trump s newly minted attorney general  jeff sessions  is apparently just another liar who s looking out more for himself than he is justice  as the head of the department of justice  he should be the last person who would ever even consider lying under oath  yet  lie he did  and now it s coming back to bite him  democrats are all over him for it  and trump s white house was forced to issue a statement on this the thing is  though  that the trump administration is wholly incapable of admitting wrongdoing in any way  shape or form  so their statement says nothing about sessions  lies  and instead  blames one of trump s old foes  the democrats themselves wh blames sessions story on democrats trying to damage potus after speech to congress  pic twitter com   jim acosta   acosta  march    this is the latest attack against the trump administration by partisan democrats   oh please  if sessions had  in fact  met with russian diplomats in his official capacity as a member of the senate armed services committee  then why wouldn t he just say so  who lies when they re sure they were well within the law and their rights to do something seriously  records literally show that sessions spoke to the russian ambassador to the u s  twice during trump s presidential campaign  nobody would lie if they truly believed they were within their legal rights  and the capacity of their job  to speak to anyone  even an enemy the only conclusion we re left with is that sessions lied  just like the disgraced general  michael flynn  lied  the white house s statement on this is typical   blaming the opposition for everything that goes wrong  including catching people committing perjury  when was the last time we had an administration lie with such impunity  some will say obama did  but he didn t  trump s administration started off with lies  and it s continuing under lies  sessions must either resign or be indicted  and trump himself must be impeached the treason of this administration must stop now featured image by zach gibson via getty images
