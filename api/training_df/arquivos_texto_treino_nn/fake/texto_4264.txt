if you wanted to see how low the trump campaign would go to win  look no further than the stunt they pulled at the second presidential debate  for weeks the trump campaign had been hinting they would invite bill clinton s alleged  victims  to the debates  but they teetered when gop establishment shut them down well  at the second debate  they did just that  they invited four women  including paula jones and juanita broaddrick  to sit front and center as the two candidates squared off one victim  however  wasn t a victim of bill clinton  she  kathy shelton  was the victim of thomas alfred taylor  a rapist hillary clinton was assigned to represent in the  clinton represented her client  begrudgingly and reluctantly  but had to uphold her oath as an attorney to represent her client to the best of her ability  it worked yet shelton still blames clinton  accusing her of crossing the ethical boundaries beholden to an attorney  she didn t   or she would have been disbarred   so what did the trump campaign do  they paid shelton    to record an in depth interview with her regarding her experiences with hillary the money was funneled by roger stone  the insane and graphically vile trump ally  through his pac  committee to restore america s greatness so now the trump campaign is buying off hillary haters and coordinating directly with pacs according the associated press stone has arranged to pay other women critical of the clintons earlier this year  stone sought to raise money to pay off the mortgage of kathleen willey  who accused bill clinton of making unwanted sexual advances toward her during her time as a volunteer in his white house in the   stone claimed in an online video interview that trump had personally contributed to the fund trump s campaign has not endorsed stone s political action committee  and has sent the group a cease and desist letter  the campaign has denied that trump gave money to willey s mortgage fund classy  republicans  real classy  buying victims of childhood sex abuse to smear a qualified woman while their own candidate admits  on tape  to sexually assaulting women  republicans have forfeited the right to call themselves the party of family values and morality kathy shelton is once again being victimized  this time by a national political party who can t win on ideas  so they have to win on disgusting tactics like this how much lower will they sink featured image via scott olson getty images
