marlee matlin may have had no comment on thursday when it was revealed that donald trump called her  retarded  because she is deaf  but she destroyed him on friday for it  recent media reports have circulated that donald trump allegedly referred to me as  retarded   the academyaward winning actress wrote on twitter   the term is abhorrent and should never be used  the fact that we are talking about this during a very important moment in u s  history has upset me deeply  trump used the term during matlin s stint on celebrity apprentice back in   during filming on the  boardroom  set  the republican nominee wrote down a question on a piece of paper asking if matlin is  retarded   he also often mocked her voice and insulted her face to face and behind her back matlin continued her condemnation of trump by pointing out that there are millions of americans who are hearing impaired and said she plans to use her voice to vote against him in november  i am deaf  there are millions of deaf and hard of hearing people like me  in the united states and around the world who face discrimination and misunderstanding like this on a daily basis  it is unacceptable  so what s my response  it s not about insults or taking each other down  as a person who is deaf  as a woman  as a mom  as a wife  as an actor  i have a voice  and i m using that voice to make myself heard and vote  my response to recent media reports   marlee  pic twitter com   marlee matlin   marleematlin  october    trump has alienated just about everyone in america except racist white guys and he should pay the price for that on election day  there is no excuse for trump s behavior  he is simply a despicable human being who should not be allowed anywhere near the white house  he owes marlee matlin and the rest of america a sincere public apology featured image  wikimedia
