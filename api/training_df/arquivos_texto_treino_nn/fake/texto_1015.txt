ever since same sex marriage became the law of the land  bible belt states have been pushing back on it  of course  we all remember the kim davis fiasco  where the rowan county  kentucky county clerk went to jail rather than issue marriage licenses to same sex couples  now  we have something similar happening in arkansas  where the state was refusing to put the names of same sex parents on their children s birth certificates  however  the supreme court handed down a decision forcing the state of arkansas to treat same sex couples just like they treat opposite sex couples the decision that was handed down was    with justices clarence thomas  samuel alito  and neil gorsuch dissenting  this comes as no surprise  since those are the three most conservative justices on the court  further  it gives us just a taste of what we are in for with trump s new justice  and it isn t good  the case reached the highest court in the land as the result of two women who filed a suit against the state when they insisted that it was not a right to have both parents listed on their infant s certificate of birth  first  the arkansas supreme court ruled in favor of the state  so the case went to the supreme court  where it was struck down luckily  this is a   ruling  so it s not on a razor s edge  like some rulings in favor of equality have been   including obergefell v  hodges  the case that legalized marriage equality nationwide  with talk of the potential retirement of justice anthony kennedy  who is usually the swing vote on the court  there could be a lot of anti equality rulings if trump puts another right wing asshole up for consideration  the last great hope is that the democrats are able to take the senate back in   and justice kennedy will wait until then to retire  for now  we can be happy that the court did the right thing in this case featured image via alex wong getty images
