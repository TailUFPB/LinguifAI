north korea has been launching  intermediate range  ballistic missiles into the sea of japan for awhile now  and  of course  it would be a good idea for us to have an administration that will actually speak out against this potential threat  yet the trump administration  for all trump s bluster about obama s  weakness  on syria  just issued a statement on their latest launch that should make everyone s jaws drop  rex tillerson literally just said  north korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile  the united states has spoken enough about north korea  we have no further comment    this is rex tillerson s statement on north korea s missile launch pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  april    s the best he can come up with  does tillerson have no idea what he s doing  probably not  no  north korea just fired a missile into the sea of japan  which one of our own allies considers a threat  back in february  they launched a missile into the same area and trump had a pow wow over it with japanese prime minister shinzo abe at mar a lago  prompting tons of questions about the security of the place  now we have no comment at all why it s possible it s because trump s both hoping and expecting china to take care of the problem so he doesn t have to  in fact  he sent chinese president xi jinping a message that  the clock has run out on north korea   and if they decide not to help   it won t be good for anyone   the funny thing is he s all bluster here  he s being a peacock about it and hoping that china will see his feathers and decide it s in their best interests to help us with pyongyang in ways they ve never done before and then we won t have to do very much  we can t take unilateral action against north korea and hope that china will fall in line  because we can t really take such action  china knows that  so what s tillerson doing here  making trump look as weak as rotted wood on north korea now but trump will use a gas attack on innocents in syria as an excuse to blast obama for being too weak  good job being a world leader  trump  you and tillerson sure showed them featured image by olivier douliery pool via getty images
