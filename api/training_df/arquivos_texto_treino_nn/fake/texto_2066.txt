donald trump s two month old presidency has been so disastrous  the only things we know he s doing  besides working to strip health care from millions of americans and humiliating the country  is play golf and watch television  a lot of television pretty much everything trump has tweeted or referred to in interviews has been influenced by something he watched on tv   fox news in particular  trump s obsession with cable news and the way he s being portrayed is an all consuming hobby for the narcissistic potus  and he s taken it to a truly disturbing level apparently  according go new york magazine reporter gabriel sherman  trump records news shows all throughout the day so he can watch how different networks have covered him right before he goes to bed  he does this every single night  in an appearance on slate s trump podcast  sherman said  people in trump world say basically a lot of fox  but the other thing he does  from a source close to the white house told me that he does dvr basically all of the cable news  it s kind of remarkable when you think about it  that someone would actually want to watch cable news on recording  donald trump  apparently he does  and when he goes back up to the residence at the end of the day  i ve been told does spend a lot of time flipping through cable networks  including cnn  and catching up on the way that he s been covered  this is a man whose validation is cemented by how the media covers him  so he sort of obsessively monitors his media coverage  so basically  trump s unhealthy obsession with television is just another way that he caters to his monstrous ego  this makes perfect sense  especially since sherman stated that trump s primary source of live information  was fox news  one of the only networks that routinely speaks of him favorably  it would be nice if  for a change  trump would stop watching television  especially the highly inaccurate fox news  and actually do his job for once featured image is a screenshot
