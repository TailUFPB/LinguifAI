donald trump s relationship with the press is problematic  to say the least   and he only has himself to thank for that  thanks to his abrasive  immature nature and his nonstop lies and  alternative facts   trump has made the political news environment extremely tense  prompting the press to push back every time he goes off the rails or puts the american people at risk  and to people in other countries  this is absolutely baffling earlier today  trump met with saudi arabian deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman and pretty much ruined the meeting by trying to impress the prince  desperate for approval and a good first impression  trump decided to make a sarcastic remark and throw the press under the bus  and he humiliated himself when it failed to have the desired effect in the oval office  trump and the prince sat down for a photo op with reporters and photographers  in the footage  trump is seen looking nasty and pissed off for the cameras  visibly irritated by something  finally  he breaks his scowl  turns to the prince and points to members of the press corps and sarcastically remarks  very nice people  trump probably thought he was so cool and clever  until his  joke  feel flat  the prince didn t get trump s weird  awkward sense of humor and instead of joining in on the insult like trump probably hoped he would  the prince let out an uneasy laugh  tilted his head and said  we hope so  the prince didn t know it  but it was the perfect response to shut down trump s bullying of the media  and apparently  people are loving every second of this on twitter  trump embarrassing himself in front of other world leaders has now become the norm  and america s reputation continues to deteriorate every time he fails to act presidential  we could hope that this awkward moment with the prince might teach him a lesson  but that s just wishful thinking at this point featured image via sean rayford   getty images
