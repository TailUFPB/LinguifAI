the  law and order candidate  broke the law again donald trump recently declared that he would reverse president obama s deal with cuba to reopen diplomatic relations between our two nations after  years  all of the concessions that barack obama has granted the castro regime were done with executive order  which means the next president can reverse them   trump said earlier this month   and that is what i will do unless the castro regime meets our demands  those demands include freeing political prisoners and expanding religious liberty that s funny  because the republican nominee certainly didn t give a shit about either of those things when he violated the united states embargo against cuba back in  a newsweek investigation revealed a company controlled by donald trump  the republican nominee for president  secretly conducted business in communist cuba during fidel castro s presidency despite strict american trade bans that made such undertakings illegal  according to interviews with former trump executives  internal company records and court filings trump s company spent a total of    for the trip to meet with government officials  bankers  and businessmen in order to gain a foothold on the island just in case the american government ended the embargo  but trump broke the law and he tried to cover up his crime by funneling the money to a consulting firm and making it look like a charitable effort in   trump traveled to miami for the first day of his presidential run as the reform party candidate and hypocritically told the cuban american crowd that he would keep the embargo in place because any money spent there  goes to fidel castro  he s a murderer  he s a killer  he s a bad guy in every respect  and  frankly  the embargo must stand if for no other reason than  if it does stand  he will come down  and so  donald trump admitted that he gave    to  a murderer  and  a killer  who is  a bad guy in every respect  now to make things clear  president obama only reopened diplomatic relations with cuba  which is within his executive power  the embargo is still in effect  but republicans have whined about obama s cuba policy ever since so what will they say about trump s blatant violation of the embargo itself and the fact that he spent    on the trip  money that dictator fidel castro must have appreciated if republicans don t condemn trump for this they will be committing hypocrisy at the highest level  it will make it clear for every american that they don t care about law and order as much as they care about power  donald trump broke the law and tried to make a deal with fidel castro s cuba and he was merely a businessman  just imagine what laws he could violate and get away with as president featured image via spencer platt   getty images
