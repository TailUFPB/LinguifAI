yes  you read the title correctly  trump s pick for attorney general has seriously said that children with disabilities attending public schools are the problem with america s education system in may   sen  jeff sessions  r ala    gave a speech about the individuals with disabilities education act on the floor of the senate  he argued that one of the main reasons public schools in america are failing miserably at educating our children is because kids with disabilities have been mainstreamed  we have created a complex system of federal regulations and laws that have created lawsuit after lawsuit  special treatment for certain children  and that are a big factor in accelerating the decline in civility and discipline in classrooms all over america  i say that very sincerely   sessions said sessions insisted that he had received letters from teachers all over the country who said they weren t allowed to properly discipline troubled or disruptive students because of the disabilities education act  we have children we cannot control because of this federal law   he said as the huffington post explains  the law  which passed in   was enacted to protect children with disabilities from the school administrators that sessions cited  it required schools to grant students with disabilities an education in a general classroom when possible  and encouraged the parents of those children to be more intimately involved in their education  the legislation  which has been reformed various times since  is credited with providing millions of children with mainstream public school access and support  sessions could care less that education advocates  even from his own state  have made it clear that the only way they have been abe to get fair treatment for disabled students is through federal regulations and the threat of lawsuits according to candace aylor  a veteran parent advocate and appointee to texas  health commission s behavioral health advisory committee  session s arguments are not only nauseating  they are heartless and misguided  if he doesn t recognize the need for schools to be required to provide a free and appropriate public education to all students regardless of disability what kind of society does he intend for us to live in   she said   what should we do  should we put them in asylums again  how far back in history should we go  are they not worthy  are they defective in his mind  it isn t likely that trump gives a hoot that his choice for attorney general thinks we should keep children with disabilities hidden in a back room and not waste our precious time educating them  after all  trump himself thinks it is perfectly acceptable to mock people with disabilities featured image via active for life
