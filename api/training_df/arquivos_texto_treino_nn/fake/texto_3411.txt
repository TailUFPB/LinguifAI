conservatives are lying when they claim banning abortion is necessary to protect women s mental health for years  conservatives have used that excuse to justify jamming anti abortion legislation down women s throats now a new study just proved that conservatives are full of shit between  and    women were recruited from  abortion clinics across  states to participate in a comprehensive study over the course of five years  the women included those who were able to get an abortion and those who were not able to get one  the purpose of the study sought to discover the mental effects of having an abortion or being denied an abortion the results of the study will likely cause conservatives to throw temper tantrums as it turns out  women suffer worse mental health consequences when they are denied the abortion they are seeking in short  conservatives are lying when they claim that abortion causes long term psychological problems dr  diana greene foster  the co author of the study  said that  mental health improves over time regardless of the outcome but the conservative claim that abortion is harmful to women s mental health is factually false  eight days after seeking an abortion  women who were denied an abortion reported significantly more anxiety symptoms and lower self esteem and life satisfaction  but similar levels of depression  as women receiving abortions  outcomes improved or remained steady over time   the study concluded  abortion denial may be initially associated with psychological harm to women and findings do not support restricting abortion on the basis that abortion harms women s mental health  at the time we started  there was a lot of debate and very little data about the actual mental health consequences from abortion   foster said   there was a public dialogue that abortion hurt women  but not much evidence  and even the best of studies didn t have a comparison group  so much of our debate is ideology with no factual reference to real women s experiences   foster continued   what this study does is give an objective look at what real women making this decision and living their lives experience  of course  conservatives are just going to deny the facts anyway because facts and evidence get in the way of their agenda to control women and their bodies featured image via cagle
