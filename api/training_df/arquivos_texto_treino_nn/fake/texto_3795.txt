racists and confederate flag worshipers may be celebrating now but director rob reiner just informed them that trump s victory will be their last on monday while promoting his film  lbj   which follows president lyndon johnson s effort to secure passage of the civil rights act of   reiner declared that trump represents the final battle of the civil war  which ended in  and was responsible for the deaths of   americans  the way i look at it  if you are trying to take an overview   the holistic approach   we are fighting the last big major battle of the civil war   reiner said  pointing out that people are protesting trump for the opposite reason why southerners protested abraham lincoln when he was elected in   there s only been two times in the history of america where upon the election of a president  the people en masse took to the streets   reiner said   one was abraham lincoln  and the other was donald trump  and for obviously  you know   degree different reasons  but both based on race  indeed  the south hated lincoln because they wanted to keep the institution of slavery alive  anti trump protesters hate trump because they don t want america to be a haven for racists who want to go back to the days of slavery or segregation millions of americans fear that trump will reign over an era where racism and discrimination is acceptable and is propped up by the federal government  to me  the scariest part of what we saw with donald trump was not understanding how much racism still existed in this country   reiner continued   it was kind of papered over for a while  i mean  we had the civil rights act  we had the voting rights act and then in the   we had  all in the family  started shining a light on racial unrest  and then we had a lot of enormous success by african americans in the media  in the news and so on  and then culminating with an african american president  so we thought  ok  we are moving in the right direction  everything is moving  but what we didn t realize that this undercurrent of racism was still there  virulent and kind of down  suppressed  but now the media is largely to blame for giving donald trump and his deplorable supporters a platform to bring the cause of white supremacists into the mainstream  and reiner blasted them for it  i don t know if you saw leslie stahl last night   reiner said in reference to trump s  minutes interview on sunday   it s embarrassing  it is embarrassing that somebody who has a national platform would softball this moron  he s a moron  and that man is in the white house now  and the press normalized him  they normalized him for a long  long time  and that s a disgrace  trump may have won by getting more electoral votes  but he lost the popular vote which is a sign that democrats can take back the white house from trump and the republicans in  with a candidate who is more popular and has less baggage  someone like elizabeth warren or kamala harris so while trump and the gop and their racists voters will enjoy their victory now  they have ignited a progressive wave of rage that is going to bury them and drag them kicking and screaming into the future america deserves featured image  wikimedia
