donald trump has made quite the fuss about tapes of conversations between himself and former fbi director james comey  problem is  no one is even convinced that these tapes exist  according to biographer tim o brien  this wouldn t be the first time trump has lied about taping people when he didn t as a method of intimidation o brien authored the book  trumpnation  the art of being the donald  but trump subsequently lost his sh t and filed a lawsuit in  because o brien s book said he was only worth a measly   million  suing ended up being a big mistake  as trump ended up busted for making at least  false statements during a deposition  his loose association with the truth becomes problematic when he s confronted with documents   o brien told cnn host brian stelter during an interview on sunday morning   we ve had decades now of trump frequently lying or exaggerating about a wide range of things  the author also let it be known that trump has a long history of lying to people about tapes of conversations just so he can try to intimidate them into doing what he wants  he s said this over the years to reporters when they go into the trump organization   i just want to let you know that i m taping you right now   o brien said   and he said it multiple times during my interviews with him  he said that into my own tape recorder when i recorded our interviews  but when he sat down for the deposition  my attorney said   mr  trump  do you have a taping system   he added   and he said no  and  said   why did you say this to mr  o brien   and he essentially said   i wanted to intimidate him  o brien s comments make it even more doubtful that trump actually as any tapes of comey at all  which is actually quite disappointing since they would almost certainly show that comey was telling the truth when he testified under oath that trump had tried to get him to drop the russia investigation and pledge loyalty  which is clearly obstruction of justice  what a pity  if there really were tapes we would be that much closer towards getting this moron out of the white house you can watch o brian s interview here featured image via video screen capture
