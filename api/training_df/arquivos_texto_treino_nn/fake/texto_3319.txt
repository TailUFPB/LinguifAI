it s going to be a long four years if donald trump is going to keep threatening anyone who says something bad about him just imagine if president obama had filed defamation lawsuits against every conservative who ever called him the n word  republicans would have thrown a giant temper tantrum but donald trump is apparently going to try to silence people by threatening them with lawsuits  which is something he did to actor tom arnold this week after arnold revealed that he has tapes from celebrity apprentice showing trump calling his own son a  retard  and saying the n word  when the people sent it to me  it was funny   arnold said during a radio show on friday   hundreds of people have seen these  it was sort of a christmas video they put together  he wasn t going to be president of the united states  it was him sitting in that chair saying the n word  saying the c word  calling his son a retard  just being so mean to his own children   oh  this is so funny  this is this guy  now  arnold never actually said that he would ever release these tapes  but that has changed because trump escalated the issue by threatening arnold with a defamation lawsuit arnold revealed on twitter wednesday that someone from trump s team left a message on his voicemail at home wife told me there s house line vm from trump camp about defamation suit so it s on  open apprentice vaults  discovery  miss universe too    tom arnold   tomarnold  december    even though trump is set to take over the presidency in january and the fact that these tapes would do nothing to change that now  trump has such a fragile ego that he s willing to threaten people with lawsuits for simply saying they have video of trump being a complete asshole trump is being petty by threatening arnold  and the fact that trump did so must mean arnold has something on him that he wants to keep buried seriously  it s time for trump to grow the hell up and learn to take criticism  he s about to hold public office now  just running for office in the first place opened himself up to this stuff  so he has nobody but himself to blame featured image  mark wallheiser getty images
