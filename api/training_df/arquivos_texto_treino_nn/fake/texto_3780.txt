in one of his first moves since becoming the president elect  donald trump has chosen one of the worst human beings in the country as his chief strategist  steve bannon was the editor in chief of breitbart news  a site that s popular with white nationalists  democrats in congress have penned a letter asking trump to fire bannon  every single republican sided with the white nationalist  if that doesn t tell you everything you need to know about today s republican party  nothing will why do white nationalists flock to bannon s former site  well  for one thing  the site defends white nationalists  if you want to be creeped out  read this  if you aren t sure what the alt right is  this article will tell you in chilling detail about the pro russian isolationists who believe in studying race differences  with  of course  white christians coming out on top then there are articles blaming african americans  really for nearly everything  but especially for crime in normal times  washington conservatives and the bannon alt right can t stand each other  the alt right is isolationist  washington conservatives are hawkish  more significantly  as the washington post put it constitutional conservatives can t stand the alt right  conservatives   real conservatives   believe that only a philosophy of limited government  god given rights and personal responsibility can save the country  and that creed is not bound to race or ethnicity  broad swaths of the alt right  by contrast  believe in a creed free  race based nationalism  insisting  among other things  that birth on american soil confers superiority  the alt right sees limited government constitutionalism as pass   it holds that only nationalist populism on the basis of shared tribal identity can save the country  it s a movement shot through with racism and anti semitism not this year  donald trump has effectively normalized the underbelly of racism  while congress for years has been hinting at their own racism with their refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of our first african american president  few have admitted their racism  until now if you still aren t convinced  those applauding the bannon appointment include former kkk leader david duke and the chairman of the nazi party  nearly every civil rights group opposed the appointment when democrats wrote the letter  signed by  members of congress  to fire bannon  not a single republican was brave enough or had enough integrity to agree that a white nationalist shouldn t be in the white house here s one of the key passages since the election there have been a number of incidents across the country in which minorities  including muslim americans  african americans  hispanic americans and jewish americans have been the targets of violence  harassment and intimidation  mr  bannon s appointment sends the wrong message to people who have engaged in those types of activities  indicating that they will not only be tolerated  but endorsed by your administration  millions of americans have expressed fear and concern about how they will be treated by the trump administration  and your appointment of mr  bannon only exacerbates and validates their concerns very proud to be leading  members of congress asking  realdonaldtrump to rescind his appointment of alt right leader steve bannon  pic twitter com     david cicilline     davidcicilline  november    is little political fallout from disavowing a white nationalist  at least you d think  but the republican voters have proven that racism and white supremacy no longer belong in the closet  the mostly white republicans in congress might still keep pretending that they aren t as racist as their party s president elect  but their failure to sign this letter was really all we needed to know featured image via scott olson getty images
