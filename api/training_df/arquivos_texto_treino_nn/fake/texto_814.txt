donald trump dropped several shocking statements in his outrageous interview with the new york times yesterday  and his comments about the department of justice were some of the worst parts of it in the interview  trump clearly stated that if he d known attorney general jeff sessions was going to recuse himself from overseeing the russian investigation  he never would have nominated the former alabama senator  trump also warned special counsel robert mueller against investigating his family s financial matters these statements are shocking and extremely unpresidential  but unfortunately we ve come to expect this from trump and his highly flawed administration  but one person  former acting attorney general sally yates  isn t going to let this slide  having experienced trump s wrath firsthand when she was fired by him several months ago for getting in the way of the infamous muslim travel ban  yates has been an outspoken opponent of trump and has been giving him hell ever since in a brutal message posted on twitter  yates trashed trump for attacking a  bedrock principle of our democracy  with his disrespectful comments about the department of justice  she wrote  potus attack on russia recusal reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of doj  a bedrock principle of our democracy  while trump still seems to think he can fire everyone who poses a threat to him  yates is the perfect example that just because trump strips people of their power and positions  he can t get them to shut up and stop exposing him  yates has become a highly respected figure after she was responsible for shutting down trump s muslim ban  and the american people play attention to what she says  if trump thought he could make her fade into the background by taking away her job  yates has just proved him very  very wrong featured image via chip somodevilla and joe raedle   getty images
