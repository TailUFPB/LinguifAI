while donald trump is currently freaking out because he hasn t been able to find anyone to perform at his inauguration  which is just a few short weeks away at this point   master chef anthony bourdain is making sure he rubs salt in trump s open wounds never one to mince his words  bourdain first asserted himself as an anti trump celebrity when he was asked if he d ever dine with trump during his presidential campaign  bourdain s reply was blunt and brutal   he said  absolutely f cking not  and bourdain hasn t changed his tone about trump  not even after the phony business mogul has been elected  in a recent interview with eater s helen rosner  bourdain further confirmed that he is as anti trump as ever  during the interview  bourdain clearly stated that he was concerned about what trump s presidency meant for his daughter   rightfully so  as any parent should be  but while trump s presidency means horrible things for many people who aren t rich white men  bourdain was able to find one silver lining in stating that he would never attend trump s white house correspondents  dinner  bourdain stated that at least trump would probably put an end to it  he said  i doubt there will be another  thank god  that s an institution i d like to see die for years  if there s one good thing to come out of the trump administration  let it be that there will be no more white house correspondents  dinners  it reinforces all the world s worst notions about the hideous  inside the beltway  all in it together culture  it brings honor to no one to have kim kardashian or tara reid sitting there next to a news anchor  what is this all about  f ck that  if i m gonna make fun of you today  i m not accepting your food tomorrow  i had dinner with president obama  but i paid  we were offered air force one  and i said   there s no way  no way  well  he s probably right  not only would there be several empty seats  but the only people who would actually attend would be swamp monsters just like trump  this is surely going to be one sour reminder to trump that he is extremely unpopular and will never be accepted in the way that president barack obama was embraced by most of america  you can read the rest of bourdain s anti trump interview on eater featured image via astrid stawiarz   getty images
