the department of justice is now arguing that the president can take money from foreign governments  why  the doj is arguing for trump because the citizens for responsibilities and ethics in washington filed a lawsuit against trump stating he is violating the constitution by accepting foreign money according to reports  trump is taking money from foreign governments for hotel room fees and golf club fees when traveling to different countries for affairs having to do with our country  however  crew  citizens for responsibilities and ethics in washington  still says trump is violating the constitution by accepting money from different countries when traveling and they say that he should have stopped doing this before he took office although crew filed a lawsuit against the trump administration  the trump administration thinks that crew lacks legal standing even to be able to file the lawsuit in the first place it doesn t matter if the trump team thinks they don t have enough legal standing for this because crew already filed the lawsuit against trump and his team during his first week in office as our president in fact  crew had this to say about the lawsuit that they filed against the trump administration  we did not want to get to this point  it was our hope that president trump would take the necessary steps to avoid violating the constitution before he took office  however  he did not  his constitutional violations are immediate and serious  so we were forced to take legal action  since the lawsuit by crew was filed during his first week in office  there have been several more plaintiff s that have come onboard against trump  some of these new plaintiffs added to the lawsuit against the trump administration include some restaurant associates  restaurant workers  and even a woman who books banquet halls for hotels in washington d c featured image by pool getty images
