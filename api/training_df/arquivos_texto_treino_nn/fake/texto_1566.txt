senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  announced who he has selected to take on crafting the senate version of the house passed american health care act  ahca   but senator dianne feinstein  d ca  is having none of it and blasted mcconnell for not putting any of the female senators in the group feinstein expressed her extreme displeasure with the decision to exclude women from this important panel on meet the press  she told andrea mitchell  i don t know what the  white men  when you have five republican women who are excluded from that  that these  men are supposed to sit down and put something together  one main problem with leaving women off of this key panel is that as passed by the house  the acha drastically changed the way pre existing conditions are treated  under the affordable care act  premiums could not be raised nor could coverage be denied to people with pre existing health issues  while many of these problems can affect men and women  such as depression and acne  some only apply to women  for example  pregnancy and problems with menstruation can be considered pre existing conditions under the house bill feinstein noted that women s health care has to be considered when they draft the senate bill  as for responses to the house bill  the american medical association  the american hospital association  and the national physicians alliance have all come out against the acha   feinstein added  women s health is a big part of this  and women are a majority of the population and their health interests deserve to be contemplated in any reform  i m really very worried that in the rush to judgment  we create a major healthcare problem for people  and we lose a lot of jobs in so doing and we create a whole atmosphere of unpredictability  for an idea of what they may now consider pre existing conditions  this is just the short list of what might force someone to pay more under trump s plan  as passed by the house  by making it legal to charge people more for having these problems  they may not be officially barring them from getting insurance but they will make it too expensive for people to afford it this list is not complete  but you get the gist  barring women from any discussions relating to this new draft for the senate is absolutely absurd and it s just one more reason why we have to keep resisting   they can t be allowed to pass this bill without every voice being heard  call your senators now before it s too late featured image via photo by justin sullivan getty images
