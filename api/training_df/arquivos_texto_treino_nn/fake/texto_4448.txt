while trump crows about all the unscientific  self selecting online polls that were rigged by his followers  the scientific polls with credibility are telling a very different post debate story  one particular poll  which nbc conducted starting from the end of the debate on sept   into sept    shows trump did so poorly that more people said neither candidate won than said trump won according to that poll   percent of likely voters said hillary won   percent said trump won  and  percent said neither candidate won image via nbc newsouch  ouch ouch ouch  for someone who was only able to speak for  percent of the time  compared to trump s  percent  and constant  just shut up because i am god  interruptions   poll numbers like that are pretty astonishing it s about as bad as when candidates finish worse than  none of these candidates  at the ballot box  basically  there is nobody except the trumpkins who believes trump did anything of value monday night  furthermore  just  percent of republican respondents said that the debate changed their opinion of trump for the better  that s a pretty sorry number compared to  percent of democratic respondents saying their opinion of hillary changed for the better some republican lawmakers on capitol hill were disappointed in trump and his performance  too  they wanted him to attack hillary over the dead horse of an email scandal they re so sure makes her unfit to lead the country  and he didn t  others  however  were frustrated with his inability to put forth succinct talking points  i wish that he d say something  stick with it  and then move on to something else instead of saying the same thing over and over and over    salmon said in an interview tuesday without giving specific examples   it was just throughout the entire debate   anyone who tries to read a complete transcript of the debate will have the same frustration  if not worse  trump literally cannot stick to the point  rambles on  talks in circles  etc   and hillary wiped the floor with him in part because of that  the rest of it   well  she s eminently qualified and he isn t  and she proved it the nbc poll was conducted online among a sample of   likely voters  culled from the  million adults who take surveys on surveymonkey every day  the margin of error is   percent  so trump isn t even tied with  neither   for second place  he finished dead last featured image by drew angerer getty images
