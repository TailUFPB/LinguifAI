a microphone guy who worked on the apprentice just came forward to tell the world that donald trump often referred to him as a  f cking monkey  according to buzzfeed news  the sound engineer is white  but he wanted his story to be heard without his name being released  because apparently  trump was quite a monster to him and to many others  including to women whom he sexually harassed he told buzzfeed  micing him was honestly the most abusive  humiliating  experience of my fifteen years as a sound engineer  he treated me like i wasn t a human being  in fact  there were several times trump would refer to him as a  f cking monkey   trump would say  woah  woah woah  who s this fucking monkey  as well as  i m not gonna let this fucking monkey touch me unless he washes his hands  then he would be monitored by trump s assistant to make sure he went and washed his hands he also told buzzfeed  trump just kept calling me a  f cking monkey  over and over  i ve mic d everyone from ben affleck to ren e zellweger  and never  ever in my career have i run into something like that  apparently  working for him was pretty much one of the worst gigs in town  he was a monster to many  many people  including several women he would sexually harass  and after listening to trump on the released access hollywood tapes  that is very  very easy to believe trump is not a person who should be allowed anywhere near the oval office  he s a racist and misogynistic egomaniac who seems to have a short temper while having none of the required experience to be leader of the free world something tells me there will be more and more of these stories coming out as we get closer to election day  and hopefully  it will be the icing on the cake to make sure he s never  ever elected president featured photo by amanda edwards getty images
