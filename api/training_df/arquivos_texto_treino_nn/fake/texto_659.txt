it s no secret that the republican party has never been comfortable with donald trump as the titular head of their organization  they also knew he was unfit to be president  yet they got him elected anyway  because they felt they had no choice  however  seven months into this disastrous excuse for a  presidency   it seems that the gop is coming to realize that trump was a huge mistake  therefore it should come as no surprise that there are already shadow campaigns from several high profile republicans   including trump s second in command  mike pence   underway for the  presidential race the new york times reports that mike pence  ben sasse and john kasich appear to be secretly lobbying gop donors in order to unseat trump should he last his full four year term  of course  the white house is pushing back against these reports  spokeswoman lindsay walters said of these efforts  the president is as strong as he s ever been in iowa  and every potentially ambitious republican knows that  however  according the the new york times  donors  elected officials throughout the republican party  and conservative groups are all saying that they don t even know if trump will be able to run in   and there is definitely support for a primary challenger to trump  of course  many of these people are not willing to publicly criticize a president from their own party  but others are  for instance  john mccain spoke for them  saying that many see trump as weak of course  both ben sasse and john kasich have been openly critical of trump  which has helped both of their public profiles to rise  further  it s pretty obvious that pence took the job as the second man on the trump ticket thinking that trump would not last in the white house  hell  maxine waters even came out and said that pence is planning his inauguration in short  the gop s bigoted base stuck them   and the nation   with trump  but  now that he hasn t been the controllable vehicle to sign their disastrous agenda into law like they thought he would be  they re ready to get rid of him   no matter the cost featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
