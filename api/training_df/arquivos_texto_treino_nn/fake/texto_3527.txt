tina fey put the jokes aside and took serious aim at donald trump in an interview with david letterman for the hollywood reporter  fey talked about human dignity and the struggle to find dignity in trump s america  what do you think is the no   struggle of humanity now   letterman asked  how are we going to proceed with any kind of dignity in an increasingly ugly world   fey responded   in a world where the president makes fun of handicapped people and fat people  how do we proceed with dignity  indeed  donald trump has apparently set his sights on destroying human dignity for the last year and half  reducing many groups of people to outcasts while basically telling white conservatives that they are the only ones in america who matter fey also talked about how women were so close to making their lives so much better  only to watch as america voted for a douchebag who will likely help republicans reverse much of the progress women have made over the last century  it feels like we were on the precipice of things getting pretty good  and now we re in a bit of a throwback moment  i definitely came out of last month feeling misogyny is much more real than two years ago  fey is also concerned about the internet and how trump and his deplorable supporters are using it  but the thing i worry about  than actual human interaction is the internet  because that s just despicable  people just being able to be awful to each other without having to be in the same room  it s metastasizing now  thanks to our glorious president elect who can t muster the dignity of a seventh grader  it s so easy for people to abuse each other and to abandon all civility  elsewhere in the interview  fey commented on trump s twitter tantrums over his portrayal on saturday night live   it just makes me feel sick for the state of the world because it s so beneath a president   she said then she commented on trump demanding an apology from the cast of hamilton for delivering a message of unity and diversity to mike pence  i thought  our president elect is a chump of a manager because don t put yourself in a position where you re asking for something and you re going to be told no you re the president  you demanded an apology that you can t get  bad management skills  tina fey is right  donald trump should focus on the presidency instead of embarrassing himself and the office by lashing out at people on twitter  he has created a toxic atmosphere of hate that has only hurt this country and millions of americans who now face the daily threat of hate crimes and bullying  he should be ashamed and he definitely should not be president featured image  wikimedia
