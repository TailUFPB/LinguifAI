there s a lot of talk that  if mueller indicts friends and associates of trump over the russia scandal  trump will just pardon them and nobody will get punished  least of all trump  there are two problems with that  first  to accept a pardon is to admit guilt  so he d be throwing them under the bus  but secondly  and perhaps more importantly  any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner  according to rep  adam schiff  d ca   his pardoning power is not exactly absolute schiff told abc news  i don t think the president s power is all that absolute  as people have been suggesting the president cannot pardon people if it s an effort to obstruct justice  if it s an effort to prevent bob mueller and others from learning about the president s own conduct  so  there are limitations  this whole thing really took off when mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether trump obstructed justice when he fired james comey  it s true that the constitution does give the president broad power to issue pardons for  offenses against the united states   however  we currently don t have any precedent for a president pardoning people tied to his own campaign  and rumors have been circulating that trump wants to test his pardoning powers to see just how far they actually go that could be part of why the tweeter in chief was panicking so badly on twitter that he screamed   do something   in a rant about hillary clinton and uranium one  he might be aware that not only is mueller getting closer to something that implicates him  which we just can t have  but also that he can t pardon anyone mueller indicts  or perhaps has been strongly warned away from trying  a pardon would require an admission of guilt  but it would also prevent people from flipping on trump and singing out the truth in exchange for lesser charges or a lesser sentence  depending on who s indicted  and what they do  the man who would be king in the white house will find it far more difficult to keep claiming that russia is just a distraction and there s nothing to it and so will all his lackeys too bad featured image via alex wong getty images
