visitors to several government websites may notice that there is an article popping up highlighting mar a lago   which is odd because mar a lago isn t government property  its a private resort owned and managed by donald trump himself  burrowing into the article  a reader may notice that the piece isn t written in a dry  serious tone befitting a governmental agency  its one glorified advertisement for the place trump and his family exclusively profit from which places a positive spin on trump s mar a lago profiteering right from the start  the marketing angle is obvious  it  like trump  insists on calling mar a lago the  winter white house  a term made up by trump to justify his numerous vacations to florida  nobody agreed to label mar a lago the  winter white house  and given its lack of security and the way it profits from trump s access  calling it a white house is in all likelihood illegal  nevertheless  trump and writer leigh hartman insist mar a lago  president trump s florida estate  has become well known as the president frequently travels there to work or host foreign leaders the first meeting between trump and president xi jinping of china will take place april   at mar a lago  which is located at the heart of florida s palm beach community from his base at mar a lago  trump has golfed over a dozen times at a golf course he owns in florida  he does not  by any account  do much  work  while he is there  in at least one example  trump s morning filled with  meetings  turned out to be trump s attempt to bingewatch golf in an empty dining room with two friends someone just posted this on instagram from trump s golf club  potus appears to be watching golf channel with  other people  pic twitter com   steve kopack   stevekopack  march    article only gets more absurd from there after refurbishing the house and adding an events space  trump opened the estate to dues paying members of the public in  as the mar a lago club post s dream of a winter white house came true with trump s election in   trump regularly works out of the house he maintains at mar a lago and uses the club to host foreign dignitaries  dues paying members of the public  is code for  rich people   those members now have untold access to donald trump and many have been seen dining near trump while the president discusses sensitive  sometimes classified information  they giddily share their brushes with trump on social media  including once photographing the military staffer in charge of carrying the  nuclear football   on trump s end  he does much to entertain the people who pay him  before the annual white house egg roll  trump threw a private easter party for rich families at mar a lago the night before vips come first pic twitter com   southpaw   nycsouthpaw  april    in case readers didn t understand why they should pay to go there  here is a fluffy description of the features when socialite and cereal heiress marjorie merriweather post built mar a lago   spanish for  sea to lake    in   she spared no expense  the  room mansion sits on  hectares of land  with the atlantic ocean on one side and an inland waterway on the other the ornate jazz age house was designed with old world spanish  venetian and portuguese influences and decorated with post s personal collection of antiques it s baffling to think why this advertisement for mar a lago would be allowed on any government website  but it has shown up on at least two  it seems to have originated on  share america   a website run by the state department with pro america articles written in the vein of  upworthy   from there it was posted inexplicably on the website for the u s  embassy in the united kingdom  no other articles of this nature show up on that website  the mar a lago promo seems to be unique it s hard to imagine this isn t blatantly illegal  trump s private business is once again getting a major boost thanks to the government trump now believes he controls  it s like cranking his conflict of interest violations up to  featured image via screengrab
