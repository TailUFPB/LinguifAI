donald trump is apparently really angry that he won the election in november because he only wanted more money from nbc and didn t want his fragile ego to get shattered longtime trump friend howard stern talked about his buddy on wednesday and had a lot to say and trump is probably going to hate it because the truth hurts stern says that he warned trump against running because if he wins the presidency it will take a toll on his mental health because his ego is so  sensitive  i personally wish that he had never run  i told him that because i actually think this is something that is going to be detrimental to his mental health he really does want to be loved  he does want people to really love him  that drives him a lot  i think he has a very sensitive ego  indeed  we witness trump s fragile ego every time he tweets in retaliation of someone criticizing him  saturday night live and alec baldwin have been targeted in particularly because they have satirized him relentlessly stern then explained that trump is desperate to be adored by celebrities and is only lashing out at hollywood and the press because he loves them so much but the feeling isn t returned  he s now on this anti hollywood kick  he loves hollywood  first of all  he loves the press  he lives for it  he loves people in hollywood  he only wants hobnob with them  all of this hatred and stuff directed towards him  it s not good for him  it s not good  there s a reason every president who leaves the office has grey hair  finally  stern revealed that trump is not happy at all about actually winning the presidency  as many people claimed during the election  trump apparently did want to lose to hillary clinton  the only real reason trump ran for office was to force nbc to pay him more money to come back and host  the apprentice   and that s why trump wants voter fraud investigations  so he can be forced out of office without quitting  he just wanted a couple more bucks out of nbc  and that is why donald is calling for voter fraud investigations  he s pissed he won  he still wants hillary clinton to win  he s so f cking pissed  he s hoping that he can find some voter fraud and hand it over to hillary  wait  nbc could have prevented this disaster from taking over the white house had they just opened their wallet a little more  seriously   well that explains why trump is angry at nbc all the time  clearly  it s not just because of alec baldwin and snl here s the audio via youtube howard stern has known trump for decades so if he says something about him we should believe him  trump s ego is fragile and he is desperate for everyone to love him  and he did appear to do everything possible to lose the election  if trump doesn t want to be president there is nothing wrong with resigning  however  if trump really wants to be loved by everyone  he can make that happen by moving our country forward instead of taking it backwards  he can start by revoking his executive orders and putting people in charge of government agencies who are not racist anti government extremists  removing steve bannon would also help  instead of tearing down president obama s legacy  trump should build upon it  if he is truly as good at building things as he claims  this shouldn t be hard for him to accomplish the presidency would be easier and he would get the love he has been seeking featured image via wikimedia
