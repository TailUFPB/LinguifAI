republicans don t care about the american people and this is proof one of the first actions republicans intend to take when donald trump takes office in january is to repeal obamacare  which would strip millions of americans of their health insurance  it would return america to a time when insurance companies could deny people coverage because of pre existing conditions  which would hurt women most since insurance companies consider being female a pre existing condition  it would also reverse the ability of children to remain on their parents  insurance until the age of  and give insurance companies the power to raise costs like never before millions of americans across the nation  especially those in red states would lose their healthcare coverage  causing the uninsured rate to skyrocket back to historic levels repeal would punish americans simply for getting access to healthcare coverage but repeal would be a windfall for the wealthy that s right  republicans are going to take healthcare away from americans and give the rich a massive tax cut at the same time according to talking points memo two taxes that will be presumably axed with the law affect only those making    or more  the break the aca repeal will bring to those taxpayers will amount to a   billion tax cut in total over  years  according to the cbo report on the  repeal legislation gop lawmakers say they ll be using as their model next year these taxes help cover the subsidies many americans received in order to help them afford a healthcare plan  but if obamacare is repealed  those subsidies will be eliminated and will serve as a tax hike on the poor and middle class this is how republicans are going to begin   they are literally going to prevent americans from affording healthcare while giving even more money to greedy people who don t need it on top of all this  republicans are aiming to phase out medicare by privatizing it and turning it into a worthless voucher system and have introduced legislation to slash social security in short  republicans are planning to break the back of the middle class and screw over the working class once and for all  the lives of every american who is not wealthy are about to become a living hell featured image  image of paul ryan by joe raedle getty images  image of mitch mcconnell by drew angerer getty images
