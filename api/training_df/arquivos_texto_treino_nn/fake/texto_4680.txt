and his church supported him an alabama  christian  pastor told a crowd at a mckenzie high school football game that if they don t stand for the national anthem they should be lined up and executed by our military pastor allen joyner of the sweet home baptist church made the announcement prior to the match  therefore abusing his position as the school s game announcer  if you don t want to stand for the national anthem  you can line up over there by the fence and let our military personnel take a few shots at you since they re taking shots for you   joyner declared on friday as the crowd cheered denise crowley whitfield  who attended the game and heard joyner s remarks  posted about them on facebook but quickly deleted the post here s a screenshot of the post via al com joyner s church posted on their facebook page that they support their pastor s statement but they were also forced to delete the post and actually went as far as deleting their account because they know how big of a shit storm they ve walked into clearly  joyner was referencing san francisco  quarterback colin kaepernick and others who support him for sitting during the anthem in protest of police brutality and racial inequality that has run rampant in this country despite the delusions of white conservatives who believe otherwise conservatives have blown a gasket ever since kaepernick began his protest  calling for him and any athlete who joins him to be thrown out of the country or worse for exercising his constitutional rights to free speech and protest butler county schools superintendent amy bryan did not make the mistake of supporting joyner s remarks and roundly condemned them before suggesting that the school board may address the remarks and deal with joyner at the next meeting  patriotism should be a part of school events but threats of shooting people who aren t patriotic  even in jest  have no place at a school   she said   threats of violence are a violation of school policy and certainly not condoned by the school board  according to al com  the most prominent condemnation of joyner came from air force veteran mark bender  who commented on sweet home alabama baptist s facebook post before the entire account was deleted  we fight so that all americans retain their rights and freedoms to protest  i would never turn a weapon on my own countryman simply because they protest by remaining seated during the national anthem  by refusing to recite the pledge of allegiance  refusing to stand or pledge during any act  these things we do  these pledges  these songs  these are not compulsory acts  they are acts that we are all free to join or not i am proud that we have that freedom whether or not i agree with someone s non violent protest  you  on the other hand are promoting extremist violence by way of state sanctioned executions  you are obviously standing for the compulsory actions by way of preaching hatred  jingoism  american exceptionalism   all because people do not believe or think as you do  i am grateful that the majority of americans do not thirst for their brother s blood as you do  you are a disgrace  those who agree with you are a disgrace  and you are a black mark upon this great nation  you should certainly hang your heads in shame  what this alleged  man of god  is advocating for is exactly what fascism looks like  this is nationalism at its most extreme and joyner should be fired by his church and removed from his announcing job by the school  he literally called for murdering people who exercise their rights and that diminishes any alleged moral authority his church could claim as well as creates a more dangerous atmosphere for people who support kaepernick  especially considering all of the gun nuts out there who are just crazy enough to use joyner s remarks as a call to action  and he ll have blood on his hands if they pull the trigger featured image  wikimedia
