ron paul  who s a retired doctor  not an economist  has a prediction that in the very near future  the stock market will lose half its value  guess who would be to blame  why it s the black guy  of course  a  percent pullback is conceivable   paul said on  futures now  recently   i don t believe it s ten years off  i don t even believe it s a year off  according to his calculations  it would cut the s p  index in half  to   and the blue chip dow jones industrial average would collapse to   paul noted that there s a lot of chaos in washington right now  with an  unpredictable president  and those who are inclined to  tear him apart  but if the market takes that big of a tumble  he doesn t see it as trump s fault  it s all man made  it s not the fault of donald trump in the last week  if the market crashes tomorrow and we have a great depression  he didn t do it in six months  it took more like six or ten years to cause all these problems that we re facing   he said source  cnbcsix to  years ago  hmmm  who was in office for the vast majority of that time paul has spent much of his career as an economic doomsdayer  and sometimes it sounds like he s right  just because  well  broken clocks and all two years ago  he predicted nearly the same collapse  but he had a solution  which could be anyone s for just      for sale on his website  of course as part of an infomercial for stansberry   associates investment research  ron paul warned that a currency crisis  of epic proportions  would arrive soon and prophesied that life in america was  guaranteed to end in disaster  as  a total breakdown of the stock market  would lead to  civil unrest  and  authoritarian clampdowns   paul said people could avoid   and even benefit from   the collapse by purchasing stansberry s  survival blueprint  for weathering the coming catastrophe for    source  cnnthe only thing ron paul hates more than regulations and the federal reserve  is a more diverse society  he s a long avowed racist who was never a fan of president obama  in march  paul s institute ran a blog post that accused obama of sabotaging trump he s also a big believer in the  deep state   which is a shadow government that really runs the united states  according to another blog post  obama is still part of that deep state a  percent drop in the stock market would be disastrous for our economy  but as i mentioned  paul is not an economist  he arguably predicted the real estate crash  but so did a lot of economists  paul  like his buddy alex jones  is full of doomsday predictions and he has books to sell  if such a drop happens  you might be able to point fingers at some obama policies  but it s trump who s scaring the hell out of everyone  including investors  if we crash  trump is driving the bus and he will get the blame   at least from most people featured image via pete marovich getty images
