republicans always like to push back on the idea that they are bigots  however  that s hard to believe  considering some of their racist and otherwise bigoted official policies  it becomes an even harder claim to believe when they have openly bigoted candidates  case in point   alabama senate candidate roy moore moore has been removed from the federal bench not once but twice  due to his allowing his bigotry to make him defy the united states supreme court  now  moore has decided that his next target of american citizens is those who do not believe in the christian god  in a shocking statement  moore says of non believers  you wonder why we re having shootings  and killings here in   because we ve asked for it  we ve taken god out of everything  we ve taken prayer out of school  we ve taken prayer out of council meetings  this man is a deranged extremist  he gave a speech just last month where he blamed america s march away from religion in the public square for the nation s ills  well  newsflash  mr  moore  america is not  never has been  and never will be a christian nation  you and your fellow fascist christ warriors are in for a rude awakening  the rest of us will not tolerate your continued verbal abuse of us  and nor will we tolerate your attempting to enshrine bigotry into law  considering where you re from   super christian alabama   you ll likely win your senate race  however  i am sure that there are cooler heads within the united states senate   including other republicans   who will find this language offensive and outrageous  as they should you  sir  are a bigot and a charlatan who has no business holding public office of any kind featured image via gary tramontina getty images
