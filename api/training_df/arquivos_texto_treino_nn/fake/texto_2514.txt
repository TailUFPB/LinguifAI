donald trump continues to be a national embarrassment who is making our country less safe at mar a lago over the weekend  trump threw a party for his friends and random guests  and as that party went on  trump was receiving sensitive information from aides as pictures were being taken all around him  someone even managed to take a picture of and with the guy carrying the nuclear briefcase that the president needs to order a nuclear strike trump s lax attitude when it comes to national security intel is particularly alarming and hypocritical since he repeatedly accused hillary clinton of being irresponsible because of her emails and kieth olbermann trashed trump for it and pointed out that if hillary clinton has done what trump is doing she would have been impeached immediately by the republican controlled congress  it boggles the mind   olbermann began   the president of the united states was reportedly receiving information vital to the security of the nation about a provocative north korea missile test in a golf club restaurant  not merely in a setting of insecurity  but surrounded by and photographed by people who could be anything from gawking tourists to russian agents  and if this cannot get worse  the president couldn t be bothered to even leave the dinner to go to a slightly more private place where random passers by cannot take souvenir pictures of a security briefing so they can post them later to facebook  oblermann went on to note that trump staffers were trying to read the information handed to trump via the flashlights on their cell phones  which can be hacked and used to transmit what they are reading to our enemies without them even knowing about it olbermann then destroyed trump s hypocrisy  trump slandered hillary clinton  you could argue trump beat hillary clinton on charges on insecure handling of emails  nothing she was ever accused of  nothing  comes close to this debacle near trump s version of the bushwood country club during the korean missile crisis if clinton had done just this  the republicans would have impeached her before sunrise  here s the video via youtube donald trump is reckless with our national security  his guests literally had a front row seat to the information he was being given  any one of his guests could have easily been a spy from an enemy nation and they would now have information to use against us  this is a serious breach that republicans in congress must take seriously and that means they need to impeach trump our national security is not a game  it s life and death for every american citizen featured image via screenshot
