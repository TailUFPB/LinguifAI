after perhaps the worst day in presidential history  something is brewing in new york that could do far more damage than any political scandal ever could  it could put trump completely out of business a group in new york state is petitioning new york s attorney general  eric schneiderman  long a critic of trump  is being urged to pull trump s business charter altogether the group is called free speech for people  they  like many liberal advocacy groups  are best known for ill fated petitions  like this one attempting to impeach trump  however  things could be different this time because of timing the group did not unearth any new information about trump s company  instead  it dug up the company s past legal infractions  such settlements over housing discrimination charges in the  and fraud allegations at trump university last year  and argued that schneiderman ought to take action against the company now that trump has become president and declined to sell his interests  by continuing to operate under trump family ownership and control with president trump in the white house  the trump organization flagrantly abuses its state granted powers  contrary to the public policies of new york against corruption and conflicts of interest  and contrary to the u s  constitution   the letter reads source  washington postwith one breaking scandal after another since the day trump took office  less than four weeks ago   the public mood  especially in blue state new york  it turning against the wannabe dictator  between trump s russia scandals  potential treason  and the fact that trump refuses to divest himself from his business interests while most in politics might dismiss the letter as being from liberal cranks  conservative cranks are typically the only ones politicians pay attention to   free speech for people have chosen the right target  schneiderman has been fighting trump since before trump became a birther  he s currently in the process of suing trump over immigration and he was one of the plaintiffs in the trump university case schneiderman has acknowledged the letter  which is more than most would likely give us  let s hope he takes up the cause  if you are in new york  contact schneiderman s office at    featured image via drew angerer getty images
