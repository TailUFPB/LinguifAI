trump spent the weekend golfing in florida  by low estimates  this is trump s  golf vacation of his presidency  by higher estimates  this is his eleventh  he s been in office for just two months  why is there discrepancies  because trump and his staff have repeatedly lied about his golfing outings  in one egregious example  staffers said he dropped by the golf course to merely chat with friends   then a pro golfer tweeted that he had just finished up a game with trump  oops  the white house simply will not be straight about trump s obsession with golf and they have every reason to be worried  trump s vacations are costing american taxpayers millions of dollars per weekend  and while he hits the links  his administration tries to cut spending on things like after school food programs for hungry kids and meals on wheels for struggling seniors it s also a reminder that trump is a massive hypocrite  during obama s tenure  trump repeatedly attacked the president for using his scant vacation days to golf  trump s twitter history is an endless parade of hostile tweets directed at obama can you believe that with all of the problems and difficulties facing the u s   president obama spent the day playing golf worse than carter  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    obama played golf yesterday     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    his campaign  trump vowed to never take a vacation and to never leave the white house  instead  he s taken six weekend vacations and spends nearly all of his time at his mar a lago resort   a business still owned by himself and which recently jacked up its membership fees to reflect the fact that joining now means getting the chance to rub elbows with the president all of this to say it was more than a little ridiculous for sean spicer to even attempt to defend his boss s hypocrisy on this front  trump is so clearly breaking his promises that even a shameless flack like spicer had to feel a twinge of embarrassment for these whoppers  nevertheless  here we are reporter  in his first eight weeks in office  president trump has made at least  trips to the golf course  he regularly used to criticize president obama for spending time on the golf course  how is his golf game any different  spicer  well  i think two things  one is you saw him utilize this as an opportunity with  prime minister abe to  um  help foster deeper relationships in asia and have a growing relationship that s going to help u s  interests  how you use the game of golf is something that he s talked about  secondly  he had a mini cabinet meeting the other day down in his club in virginia and i remember so many people jumping to the conclusion that he s going down and playing golf  just because you go somewhere doesn t necessarily mean you did it all of what spicer just said is unfettered garbage  for starters  president obama frequently used his time playing golf to conduct official business  including one time inviting the malaysian prime minister to a round to   you guessed it  help foster deeper relationships in asia  obama was able to accomplish that without spending every single weekend of his presidency playing golf as to spicer s second point  his example of trump s  mini cabinet meeting  in virginia is an awkward one  if trump wasn t golfing there  why was he there at all  why move all of his staff down to a virginia golf course that he owns just to hold a meeting he could have had at the white house  perhaps because  as with mar a lago  trump still owns that business and forcing the entire white house to attend a meeting there is a financial boon to trump s own bank account  spicer s hamfisted attempt to defend trump s golfing actually makes him look more corrupt featured image via youtube
