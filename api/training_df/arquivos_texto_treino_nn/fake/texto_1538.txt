as if firing fbi director james comey wasn t stupid enough  trump has gone and driven two more nails into his own coffin this evening  first  he hired an outside law firm to send a certified letter to sen  lindsey graham  who chairs the senate subcommittee that heard testimony from james clapper and sally yates on may   regarding the russia probe second  he s meeting with vladimir putin s top diplomat to the u s   sergey lavrov  in the white house wednesday morning  the associated press says that this could be a signal that our relationship with russia is improving again  but in the wake of the clusterfuck that was trump s entire tuesday  this does not look good at all first  the law firm and the letter  trump wants the letter to sen  graham to claim that he has no connections to russia seriously he s hired an outside law firm to draft and send a letter to sen  lindsey graham claiming that he has no connections business or otherwise to russia  because obviously but wait  this move achieves the impossible by getting even more ridiculous than that  sean spicer briefed the white house press corps on this development  and said  the president  obviously  was aware of senator graham s suggestion after he made it today and he s fine with that  he has no business in russia  he has no connections to russia  so he welcomes that in fact  he is already charged a leading law firm in washington  d c   to send a certified letter to senator graham to that point that he has no connections to russia  if he knows he s got no connections at all to russia  and he knows he s completely innocent of all these allegations  then why hire an outside law firm to send a letter to sen  graham reiterating that  that s not what someone who s sure of their innocence does now  his meeting with lavrov is taking place after lavrov meets with secretary of state rex tillerson  both meetings will supposedly focus on stabilizing syria   the trump administration seems to think that we need to work with russia to accomplish anything there  but  as the ap notes in their story  he meeting will be impossible to separate from the trump administration s unfolding political drama in washington  where fbi and congressional investigations are looking into possible collusion between trump campaign associates and the kremlin related to last year s presidential election  u s  intelligence agencies accuse moscow of meddling to help trump s chances of victory  that  combined with this letter he s sending to sen  graham  and we have to wonder exactly how such a letter is going to prove that he s got no connections to russia at all   just looks really  really bad  in fact  it s starting to look like the world is about to come crashing down around him featured image by olivier douliery   pool via getty images
