this brings party before country to a whole new level  republicans are admitting they are fine with treason  as long as they achieve their political goals that was the message ann coulter delivered on her twitter feed on friday night if  realdonaldtrump builds wall  ends o s  executive amnesty   bans muslims   deports illegals  he could make putin vp   betterthanreagan  ann coulter   anncoulter  july    fact  republicans have been demonstrating all year that they don t really care what donald trump does as long as they get what they want  so as trump once said  he could literally murder someone right now in broad daylight and republicans wouldn t lift a finger to do something about it what s even scarier is that conservatives like coulter are also perfectly fine with russian dictator vladimir putin being put in a position of power in the united states government  of course  we all already know that putin has power over the government from the outside  trump is his puppet and he s pulling the strings from moscow coulter goes even further by claiming that trump is  better  than ronald reagan  keep in mind that reagan would never have colluded with russia to win an election  he certainly would not have allowed russia to dictate what he does as president  reagan is rolling in his grave right now because of what trump has done and is doing as the evidence continues to stack up against trump  republicans are just letting him get away with ignoring the constitution and flouting the law  he has repeatedly lied to the american people  repeatedly obstructed justice  and is using the white house to enrich himself and his family  and they are willing to let him burn down our democracy and humiliate our nation as long as it means they get to enact their political agenda and remain in power the fact that conservatives like coulter actually want putin to be vice president should scare the hell out of every american  especially those who constantly claim to be  patriots  featured image via steffen kugler bpa getty images
