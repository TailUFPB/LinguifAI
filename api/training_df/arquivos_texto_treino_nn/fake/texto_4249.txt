after the  audio tape of republican nominee  donald trump  making lewd comments about sexually assaulting women  there s been a lot of buzz about the existence of even more incriminating trump footage from the apprentice while no tapes have been released yet  the hollywood reporter interviewed several apprentice contestants who were more than willing to spill the beans on what behavior they saw from trump during their time on the reality tv show   and it s not good according to a camera operator  the comments that trump made on that leaked audio tape are an exact representation of who trump is   something trump himself denied during the second presidential debate  the camera operator said that while trump was a host on the show  the business mogul would regularly make women feel uncomfortable with what he called  borderline sexual misconduct  and blatant sexism  the camera operator said  it was more a creepy feeling you felt when he was around on set  the way he looked at you or would be dismissive to all the female producers and only deal with mark burnett   he was just an overall assh le who thought of himself as very important  another contestant said that trump would objectify his female contestants  only remarking on their appearance  he would also demean them and speak to them as if they were children  which was very different from how trump treated the men on his show  when we first started shooting and there were still a lot of contestants and you don t necessarily know all their names well  he definitely would describe the girls by their bodies and their physical attributes  marshawn evans  a former contestant  further explained  if you were in the middle of the discussion or talking about the merits of why you won or lost  sometimes you would be interrupted with a compliment or something that had to do with your physical attributes  that happened pretty much every single time you re in the boardroom  and it wasn t just contestants that were targeted  trump also disrespected female crew members  according to one source  we would not necessarily send the girl camera crews to do the close up stuff just because it was always weird  i know one of our camera operators would get uncomfortable  i found out from her after the fact that he was saying things to her  dr  randal pinkett  who was the  apprentice winner  has also spoken out against trump to confirm that he is absolutely a misogynist and racist  he said  it was not uncommon on the set of  the apprentice  for donald to make public comments about women s looks  about who he would sleep with or who he would ask others would they sleep with  it was demeaning  disrespectful  almost reprehensible behavior for a professional environment  he has been divisive  he has been sexist  he has been misogynist  he s been racist  this is not  in my opinion  the leader that we need for our country at this time  you can watch pinkett s interview below  apprentice winner  randalpinkett speaks out about sexual harassment on the set of  realdonaldtrump s reality show   releasethetapes pic twitter com   moveon org   moveon  october    by the looks of what s happening on social media  trump is having an awful week twittertwittertwittertwitterhe only has himself to thank for this featured image is a screenshot
