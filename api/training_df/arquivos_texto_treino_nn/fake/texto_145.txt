the gop congress  with the approval of donald trump  is putting forth yet another tax bill that would take food off the tables of regular people so the wealthy can hoard even more money  you would think they would show a modicum of shame  that they would at least pretend that they are working for the voters  but this is the age of trump and they are proud of the oligarchy they ve created  they are so proud they are literally saying  in front of reporters  that they don t care what the voters think about this wildly unpopular tax plan several polls have proven that tax cuts  especially tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy  barely scratch the surface of americans  concerns  it s hardly even a priority for brainwashed republicans  only about a quarter of americans overall think tax reform should be a top priority  while barely half of republicans   percent  think it should head the agenda the majority of americans have had it with the trickle down argument and they don t believe that a corporate tax cut will lead to more jobs some gop selling points aren t sinking in  one of republicans  biggest talking points is that a corporate tax cut will benefit workers  though even right wing economists have cast doubt on white house estimates on this point  but nearly  percent of people believe corporations won t  use that money to create jobs   according to the cbs poll  likewise  approximately half of people in both the cbs and nbc wsj polls said they think the bill would grow the economy   a plurality but not a clear majority source  nprscrew what voters think  at least that s the mindset of republicans who know exactly who put them in office  the oligarchy  a vox reporter confronted some gop congressmen about the tax bill that few people have seen and the most telling answer came from rep  chris collins  r ny   who in two words told us exactly what he thinks of his constituents  opinions others had answers the weren t quite as callous and were a bit more measured  they fell back on denial and trump s  fake news  copout  i don t believe that poll   stressed texas rep  mike conaway  i would love to see those polls  because those aren t polls of my constituents   added missouri rep  jason smith golshan couldn t find a single republican member of congress who would acknowledge how unpopular the idea is with voters of passing a tax bill to let corporations pay even less of their fair share republicans need to work a little harder on their messaging of their pet tax bill  according to fivethirtyeight com  republicans have a chance to pass their first major initiative since trump took office  as long as they can get americans to back it  so far  they are failing and their cavalier responses to americans  concerns aren t helping  of course  collins might be right  as long as they have gerrymandering  voter suppression and russia in their back pockets  voters  opinions might not actually matter featured image via pool getty images
