now we know the real reason why republicans oppose universal healthcare donald trump s army secretary nominee mark green is a tennessee state senator who thinks healthcare is an obstacle that prevents churches from converting people to christianity apparently  is people are healthy  it s a lot harder for them to be taken advantage of  the sick  on the other hand  will be desperate to feel better  and without healthcare to make them better  green says they ll be forced to turn to god  the person who s in need   they look to the government for the answer  not god  and i think in that way government has done an injustice that s even bigger than just the creation of an entitlement welfare state   green said in   in this setting  i ll share the story  i think it interrupts the opportunity for people to come to a saving knowledge of who god is  i see our sort of government based assistance taking god out of the picture   green said   if you look at the gospels and you go and study the gospels  every person who came to christ came to christ with a physical need  it was either hunger or a disease  people go to god because of a physical need and they walk away with a spiritual need met  in other words  green opposes healthcare because he wants sick people to be desperate enough to convert to his religion  this is all about forcing people to accept a religious belief if they are sick instead of giving them the medical care they need  basically  this is blackmail on a sickening level republicans are basically saying that sick people should have to become devout christians first before getting the healthcare they need on thursday  house republicans voted to strip healthcare from millions of americans  the bill also fails to cover those with pre existing conditions and gives a massive tax gift to the wealthy  one wonders if green s beliefs figured into their morally bankrupt decision the bottom line is that people should not have to adopt a religious belief in order to get healthcare such a system is cruel and further breaks down faith in religious institutions  churches would become nothing more than prisons where the less devout and non believers are punished by being denied real healthcare that s not what america is all about featured image  wikimedia
