whiny white house advisor kellyanne conway does not like how the media treats her illegitimate president  donald trump  she s continuing her crusade against the first amendment  interestingly  she  president steve bannon  and trump  have treated the press very badly  yet they feel they should get favorable coverage anyway  conway appeared on sean hannity s radio show  and talked about how mean the press is to donald hannity asked conway if the media at large was being  beyond disrespectful  to trump and his staff  according to mediaite  conway agreed then said that the coverage was  inciting mob mentality if not mob violence  the coverage never changed   it never progressed  it never matured   conway said conway said she thought protesters had  a very low level of literacy  of the issues against which they demonstrated  when the truth is that her boss s grammar sits at just below a  grade level  it never took on the aura of respect that it deserved  and if you are not showing the president and his main spokespeople respect  then you re not showing the office respect  and you are inciting mob mentality if not mob violence   she said   you are encouraging people to go out there and unpeacefully protest and block airport entrances for people who are going to visit a sick parent and can t make their flight  or are going for a bereavement call and can t make their flight  listen below people are treating donald with the respect he deserves  protesters know exactly why they went to airports across the country  people were being unconstitutionally detained and handcuffed  even children  conway said at the time that the whole idea that these people are being separated from their families is  temporary   she called it an  inconvenience   so  kellyanne  just consider the treatment trump is getting an  inconvenience   and something that is  temporary  until his impeachment she literally complained that the press is being mean to donald to a fox news host who treated former president barack obama like dirt for  years   quit being so pc  kellyanne  conservatives tell me it s destroying our country featured image by mark wilson via getty images
