lately  republican presidential nominee donald trump has been making a show of reaching out to black voters  of course  it hasn t been actual black people he is speaking to  after all  other than uncle tom types like omarosa and don king  that s a voting bloc he s never going to win  no  he s trying to send a signal to white voters who can t stomach voting for an overt racist that he s not  well  racist  he s trying to make them forget all the racist garbage he s spewed throughout this campaign and throughout his life perhaps the most despicable part of this so called  outreach  is the fact that he is using the black community to try and score political points  he is going to black churches and troubled communities to try and convince people that he cares  well  one place that trump tried to use on his crazy outreach tour has completely rebuffed him  the international civil rights center and museum in greensboro  north carolina according  earl jones  co founder of the museum  trump s team made a list of exploitative demands that disrespected the museum staff and insisted upon special treatment for trump   including closing the place down for hours on end so that trump could come  well  that wasn t happening for sure  jones said  the co founder went on to say of the trump camp s request  we did not honor the request of the donald trump team because we thought they demonstrated  in their approach was disrespectful  so therefore we did not grant that request the approach  the type of disrespect  pretty much a demand and bullying us to use the museum in their manner and their way in their time   it was inappropriate and i think it s probably reflective of the type of insensitivity of civil rights and human rights that s reflective from trump over the years  who wouldn t want to be a fly on the wall when trump got this news  that was probably a temper tantrum for the ages  kellyanne conway probably had to take his phone for hours on end so that he wouldn t attack these people on twitter for daring to stand up to his blatant and aggressive attempts to use them to score political points anyone who isn t completely tone deaf here knows that trump doesn t give a damn about black people   or anyone else  for that matter   and it s about time that some of these places stop allowing trump to use them to engage in his disgusting brand of dog whistle racist politics well done  international civil rights center and museum  and earl jones  it s about time someone called trump on his shit featured image via spencer platt getty images
