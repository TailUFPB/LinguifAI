people like to pretend that mike pence is the grown up in the room compared to donald trump s brash childishness from the white house  however  he proved that wrong on sunday  when he left the indiana colts football game because a few of the players on the team opposing the colts chose to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown americans  taking a leaf out of trump s playbook  pence tweeted i left today s colts game because  potus and i will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers  our flag  or our national anthem   vice president pence   vp  october    everyone is entitled to their own opinions  i don t think it s too much to ask nfl players to respect the flag and our national anthem  vice president pence   vp  october    like trump  pence forgets the meaning of the first amendment  and seems to think that his position gives him the right to try to bully owners  players  and ultimately the national football league into following his orders  further  it is worth noting that the colts were playing the san francisco   which is the former team of colin kaepernick  the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the nfl for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color  further  pence and trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers  dime   because of course we paid for pence to travel to that football game  for one thing  the press was kept in the van  in anticipation of pence stirring the pot and then leaving the media pool was kept in the vans ahead of the game instead of being led in with vpotus  https   t co   vaughn hillyard   vaughnhillyard  october     was pence leaving colts game a political stunt  reporters were told to stay in van bc  there may be an early departure from the game    peter alexander   peteralexander  october     trump  admitted to ordering pence to leave if the  took a knee  which of course everyone knew they would i asked  vp pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled  disrespecting our country  i am proud of him and  secondlady karen   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     in short  this was all premeditated racial pot stirring  unsurprising from trump  but somewhat surprising from pence  who has been trying very hard to keep up the idea of how omfg  notracist  he is  well  that s out the window now another white supremacist takes his hood off in the trump administration featured image via justin sullivan getty images
