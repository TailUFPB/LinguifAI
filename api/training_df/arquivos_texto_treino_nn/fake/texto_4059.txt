hillary clinton often talks about how donald trump can be baited with a tweet  and thus he s ill suited to be president of the united states because he can t be trusted with his twitter account  let alone the nuclear codes one twitter user just tested this theory  and the results were absolutely hilarious eric curtin  otherwise known as     on twitter  is a self described  writer for things  and to the rest of us  he s a f cking genius he recently tweeted out this series of images that shows his brilliant level of trolling  and who did he troll  none other than republican presidential nominee  donald j  trump trump doesn t follow many people at all on twitter  but when curtin tweeted  realdonaldtrump   follow me back so i can dm i have important info about hillary  the gop nominee quickly took the bait and followed him back what happened next is pure comedy genius first  came the initial invitation to trump then came the follow by trump followed by the direct message to trump  then the immediate block by trump curtin then tweeted out a wrap up of all that transpired with the simple caption  life comes at you fast  life comes at you fast pic twitter com   spooky turtle     october    don t know about you  but that s pretty damn hilarious  not only that  it proves hillary correct that trump can very easily be baited with a tweet  he s also apparently extremely desperate for dirt on hillary because he followed back a random twitter account this is yet another reason trump can t be allowed anywhere near the oval office featured photo by scott olson  frederick m  brown getty images   twitter
