donald trump has definitely gone off the deep end this time whenever a terrorist attack has occurred in this country or overseas  the media has been quick to report on it  from the attacks on   in new york  to those in nice and paris in france and elsewhere  the media has always kept us informed when an attack happens donald trump  however  thinks terrorist attacks are happening every minute of the day and in an effort to scare people and justify his policies  such as his muslim ban  trump literally accused the media of covering up terrorist attacks in europe  all over europe it s happening   trump said during remarks to u s  central command  centcom  on monday   it s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported  and in many cases the very  very dishonest press doesn t want to report it  they have their reasons and you understand that  here s the video via twitter trump says terror so bad  it s not even being reported  and in many cases the very  very dishonest press doesn t want to report it       pic twitter com   steve kopack   stevekopack  february    is a complete lie and the american people ought to be totally outraged by the accusation  in no way has the media ever ignored a terrorist attack in europe  as we have personally witnessed over the last few years  the media has provided extensive coverage of attacks that occurred in paris  nice  and brussels in europe along with attacks that occurred outside of europe in beirut and ankara trump s accusation is irresponsible and plain untrue and he is doing it as a way to gain support for his unconstitutional muslim ban earlier in his remarks  trump once again spewed delusions about the election  bragging about how the numbers prove that everyone likes him even though he lost the popular vote by nearly  million votes to hillary clinton  we had a wonderful election  didn t we   trump began   and i saw those numbers   and you like me and i like you  here s that video via twitter trump begins centcom remarks by saying   we had a wonderful election  didn t we  and i saw those numbers   and you like me and i like you  pic twitter com   steve kopack   stevekopack  february    s time for the press to start punishing trump  media networks should no longer allow trump surrogates to appear on television because it is clear that they are not telling the truth and are only there to spread misinformation and propaganda cnn recently refused to have kellyanne conway on their programming because she has zero credibility  every single network should follow their lead the accusation that the press intentionally covers up terrorist attacks is outrageous and should draw a sharp rebuke and condemnation from media networks all over the world  donald trump is literally saying that europe is plagued by terrorist attacks  it s the same thing as kellyanne conway citing a non existent terrorist attack in bowling green  kentucky  trump and conway are making shit up to defend the administration s bigoted agenda and they cannot be allowed to get away with it read more featured image via screenshot
