an aging audience combined with a devastating sexual harassment lawsuit and the exodus of several high profile hosts and the resignation of roger ailes has all but crippled the conservative propaganda machine in recent months fox news has settled with former host gretchen carlson for   million after she revealed that ailes had been sexually harassing her for years  fox   friends host steve doocy was also named by carlson as a perpetrator but there has been no word as yet on whether he will also get the boot or resign  he probably wouldn t be able to get another job in the media anyway if he did but soon after carlson s allegations  andrea tantaros slapped the network with a sexual harassment lawsuit of her own  not only naming ailes but also bill o reilly  who allegedly made sexual advances toward tantaros that might make it easier for fox to choose between keeping megyn kelly or the longtime host of the o reilly factor if reports that the network might have to choose one or the other are true and now  just after announcing the settlement  longtime host greta van susteren has departed fox news as well and will be replaced by obnoxious sexist brit hume  who once complained that new jersey governor chris christie can t act like a real man because of feminists and creepily  complimented  megyn kelly by marveling about how smart she is despite being pretty way to go  fox  you had a chance to replace van susteren with another woman or at least with a male anchor who isn t a misogynist and you failed spectacularly  replacing her with hume must mean you didn t learn a damn thing from all the sexual harassment lawsuits being filed against you  we are grateful for greta s many contributions over the years and wish her continued success   fox news said in a brief statement that also included a public apology to carlson this is the biggest staff shakeup within fox news to occur in many years  the sexual harassment bombshell has shattered a working environment that the network cultured for decades and now it is biting them hard  if bill o reilly or megyn kelly or both end up jumping ship for calmer waters next year when their contracts expire it could throw the network into even worse chaos again  fox news may have a large audience but their audience is older and that means big trouble for a network that has largely refused to appeal to a millennial audience  losing kelly would not help but considering how many female hosts have left fox recently and the fact that fox chose brit hume of all people to replace van susteren  it appears kelly could very well decide to leave the toxic anti women atmosphere of fox news  which tantaros described as a media company that  masquerades as a defender of traditional family values  but behind the scenes  it operates like a sex fueled  playboy mansion like cult  steeped in intimidation  indecency and misogyny  featured image  brendan hoffman getty images
