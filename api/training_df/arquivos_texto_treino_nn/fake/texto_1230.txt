former fbi director james comey is testifying before the senate intelligence committee today  but he asked the committee to release a copy of his opening statement yesterday  which lit the internet on fire  the big question everyone s asking is  did trump try to obstruct justice with his improper demands of comey  comey will not level that accusation himself   he ll very likely leave it up to the senate to decide whether his testimony is sufficient for such a charge but philip allen lacovara  who served as counsel to watergate s special prosecutors  archibald cox and leon jaworski  says that comey s prepared statement alone is enough for an obstruction of justice case if there s anybody who recognizes the scenario that s unfolding  it s the people who were heavily involved with  or in covering  watergate  in a story published in the washington post  lacovara writes comey proved what director of national intelligence daniel coats and national security agency director michael s  rogers carefully avoided admitting in their testimony on wednesday  that the president had specifically attempted to shut off at least a major piece of what trump calls the  russia thing   the investigation into the misleading statements by fired national security adviser michael flynn concerning his role in dealings with the russians then he says this kind of presidential intervention in a pending criminal investigation has not been seen  to my knowedge  since the days of richard nixon and watergate the details that comey provides are  red meat for a prosecutor   according to lacovara  they also demonstrate that there was an element of threat involved in trump s behavior  trump contacted comey about the investigation multiple times  each time either suggesting comey wasn t sufficiently loyal and issuing veiled threats to his job or expressing displeasure that he hadn t dropped the investigation yet  more than once  trump whined about the  cloud  that the russia scandal  and how it was interfering with his ability to get anything done  shortly after the last time this happened  comey was fired that s not quite the bombshell  though  toward the end of lacovara s piece in wapo is where the bomb is comey s statement lays out a case against the president that consists of a tidy pattern  beginning with the demand for loyalty  the threat to terminate comey s job  the repeated requests to turn off the investigation into flynn and the final infliction of career punishment for failing to succumb to the president s requests  all followed by the president s own concession about his motive  any experienced prosecutor would see these facts as establishing a prima facie case of obstruction of justice  at this point  if the senate does its job  it will determine that trump s repeated demands of comey constitute obstruction of justice  the worry here is that republicans are so partisan that they ll try and find wiggle room  a loophole  a pseudo plausible way to deny it  or anything else that will allow them to dismiss comey s testimony out of hand featured image via susan walsh pool getty images and win mcnamee getty images
