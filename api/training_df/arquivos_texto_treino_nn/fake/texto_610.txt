wednesday morning  donald trump started his day off just like any normal bizarre despot  with tweets celebrating the world s fear and outrage at his nuclear threats toward north korea  he retweeted fox   friends on twitter no less than three times for their breathless coverage of his manly escapades  but in the middle of his bluster  trump forgot once again that the internet is a forever place  where no facts are ever lost  except to the swirling vortex of a trump supporter s mind perhaps he was relying on that very fact   that his supporters will believe anything he says   when he made a claim about his first order as president  in a pair of tweets continuing the theme of the day  trump asserted that he was responsible for the modernization of our nuclear program my first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal  it is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    hopefully we will never have to use this power  but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    for trump  he s wrong on two counts  not only was that not his first order   that was on obamacare   but it wasn t even him that began the renovation and modernization process  that would be the guy before him  ben rhodes  the former foreign policy adviser to barack obama  was quick to point out trump s lie it s literally impossible for trump to have changed our nuclear arsenal in  months  alarming thing to lie about  https   t co   ben rhodes   brhodes  august    we all have to rally around the leader because he decided to threaten north korea with nuclear destruction  get ready for more of this  https   t co   ben rhodes   brhodes  august    about the size of our nuclear arsenal and sending aides out to demand we rally around the leader is chilling  and it s only month   ben rhodes   brhodes  august    s not the first time trump has lied about things he s done  and it certainly won t be the last  but the fact that this is a lie about nukes makes it a little more alarming and indicates that trump truly doesn t understand the gravity of the situation  already  we re seeing reports from aides saying that trump wasn t actually serious in making his nuclear threats  but this isn t something to be taken lightly what s more  there s plenty of reason to be concerned about the very first thing trump did do regarding our nuclear arsenal  in case anyone s forgotten  he put a guy he beat in the primary by calling him a dumbass in charge of it read more featured image via pete souza getty white house handout
