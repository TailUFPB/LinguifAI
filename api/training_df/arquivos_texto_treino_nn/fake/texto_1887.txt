there s nothing odd about donald trump getting blasted day in and day out by the media and those who didn t support him in the first place  but the rate at which trump gets crucified by his own republican party is unprecedented the latest goper to take trump to the woodshed is republican strategist rick wilson  who pretty much obliterated trump s presidency today  in several tweets this morning  wilson brutally blasted trump by stating the obvious  which many conservatives are still afraid to admit  trump is is bad at being president  pointing out that  trump s poll numbers suck for a reason   here s what wilson had to say about america s undeserving president  then  wilson lashed out at the remaining republicans that are still defending trump and standing by him despite all of his failures and shortcomings  in a shocking rant attacking conservatives that refuse to see how dangerous and incompetent trump really is  wilson continued   wilson is   right  trump is not presidential material  and he has made very little attempt to actually rise up to the challenge of his new role and responsibilities  his polling numbers alone are the most pathetic we ve ever seen  and many americans are in complete agreement with what wilson is saying here the republican party has screwed itself by allowing trump to succeed  america will remember the gop as the party forever attached to the least successful  most shameful president the country has ever had  trump s ties to russia alone will brand the gop as the least patriotic political party in existence  the damage trump has done to the party is irreversible  and wilson knows it  he s part of the group of republicans that is increasingly frustrated by what he sees of trump and the gop  and clearly  wishes this nightmare would be over already featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
