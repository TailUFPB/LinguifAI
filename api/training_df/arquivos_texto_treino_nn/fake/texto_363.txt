i m shooting for irony here  so bear with me  thank god some people proclaim their bigotry out loud  so you don t have to find out the hard way okay  so this couple  who are choosing to remain anonymous  kind of did find out the hard way  but they re still free to make other arrangements after the minister of their church called them into a private meeting to let them know he would no longer perform their ceremony or allow them to marry in his church pictured  ironythe problem  according to minister steven north of ebenezer st  john s presbyterian church  was the bride s recent comment on facebook in support of marriage equality in her native australia  the country is holding a survey   because some places value the individual input of their citizens   to help the australian parliament decide whether or not to allow same sex couples to marry apparently  the clergyman was monitoring the bride to be s social media  where she spoke up in support of the measure  i know it s something not everyone will agree on and that s fine but this is what i stand for and frankly it doesn t effect  my relationship with  one bit  that s when north made the decision to summon the couple into his office  not only did he tell them that he would not perform the ceremony  but he drove the point home with a letter to the couple as well  after the pre marital counselling that you attended and the sermons delivered at ebenezer on this subject  you must surely appreciate that your commitment to same sex marriage opposes the teaching of christ jesus and the scriptural position practiced by the presbyterian church of australia and by me  this conflict of views has practical consequences in relation to your upcoming wedding  if i remember correctly   and believe me  as someone who was raised in a very religious household  i do   jesus said as much about same sex weddings as he did about abortions or whether his dad wants you to drink that miracle water that creepy peter popoff sells at  am on cable  that is to say  nothing  there were no  teachings of christ jesus  on gay marriage  so really the operative part of north s statement is that whole thing at the end where he says  and by me  the bride was having none of it  the couple has decided to leave their long time church  and they did so with a statement of their own  we feel this decision is absolutely disgraceful and is a disgrace to you and all the church  especially when we have been loyal and valued members of this congregation for  years  you were made aware from the beginning of our proceedings that we had gay friends and also that people in our wedding party were gay  how could you assume that we would abandon them or degrade them with regards to same sex marriage  rather than acquiesce to the thought police of her bigoted church  this couple has faith that they re doing the right thing featured image via scott barbour getty images
