former texas congressman ron paul added yet more fuel to the argument that older people should stay away from twitter when he either confused isis with al qaeda or simply proved that he has absolutely no idea what he is talking about in a misinformed tweet on monday night remember  there was no al qaeda until our foolish invasion of iraq based on neocon lies   ron paul   ronpaul  august    could only wish that the  year old paul  a man who has run for president three times as both a libertarian and republican  and one who also holds a degree in medicine from duke university  would be slightly more intelligent  but apparently that just isn t the case  we currently have a president in office who is concerned the with mainstream media spouting  fake news   yet doesn t call out fellow or former republicans when they do the exact same thing  however  fortunately there were plenty of people on twitter who were willing to do so on trump s behalf actually he s right  no al qaeda in iraq before we invaded   mike nakadai   cinemiike  august    s is terrible  thoughts and prayers   nosferatu   chrisrosendin  august    still remember    pic twitter com   wegovernusa   wegovernusa  august    it over when when germans bombed pearl harbor germans forget it  he s rolling   wulander   wushocks  august    if we were to give paul the benefit of the doubt and believe he made a simple absent minded error  his factually deficient tweet proves that it is people like him who are the main source of this  fake news  problem  all it would ve taken was a little fact checking and proof reading to see the error in his propaganda  but maybe we can clear it up for him if he is able to see the flaw in his tweet  wants to retract the statement  but can t be bothered with the research al qaeda was founded by osama bin laden  abdullah azzah  and other arab volunteers in the  to fight the soviet invasion of afghanistan  however  they will forever go down in history for the   terror attacks  an event that definitely happened before the u s  invasion of iraq in   isis  on the other hand  achieved notoriety following the u s  invasion of iraq  but they still existed before then  founded in  by jordanian salafi jihadist abu musab al zarqawi under the name jam at al taw d wa al jih d and pledging their allegiance to al qaeda in  see  ron  fact checking isn t that difficult and it helps prevent opening old wounds  or ones that are still reasonably fresh with the pain still being felt to this day  wounds such as   featured image via alex wong getty images
