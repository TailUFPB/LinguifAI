trump just can t get anything off the ground for his failing presidency  every time his approval numbers start to inch up  he does something else and the next poll shows his approval in the tank again  and sometimes  like now  it slips below its previous crater according to a quinnipiac poll conducted may    only  percent of registered approve of the job trump is doing  that s down from  percent in mid april  and is a near record low for his presidency  on april   his approval was  percent this poll was conducted before trump fired james comey from his position as fbi director  so that controversy hasn t hit the polls yet  this nosedive is in response to other things trump and the republicans have done over the last several weeks  but even without that   percent of voters think trump is a goddamn liar  he is   and  percent believe he s not levelheaded  he isn t  trump s biggest drop was among white voters without a college education  these people are the same who voted for him because they bought his song and dance about being able to bring an unprecedented level of prosperity back to them  just  percent approve of his job now  compared to  percent last month  percent is a huge drop for less than four weeks  particularly from trump s own base another interesting aspect of this poll is that a majority of americans now want the democrats to take control of congress in    that number stands at  percent  compared to just  percent that want republicans to retain control  the biggest thing people seem to be unhappy with is the gop s very unpopular plan to repeal the affordable care act  neither trump nor republicans seem to care that even their own constituents want them to fix the aca rather than repeal it on april   trump s approval rating among independents was  percent  and that has likewise plummeted  it stands at just  percent now remember  none of this includes the clusterfuck surrounding james comey s termination  it ll be interesting to see what happens going forward   that decision was extremely controversial  and congressional democrats  along with some republicans  are unhappy and suspicious now featured image by molly riley pool via getty images
