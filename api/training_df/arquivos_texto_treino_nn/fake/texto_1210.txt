donald trump broke his twitter silence over james comey s senate testimony on friday morning by committing an act of obstruction  not smart during the former fbi director s testimony on thursday  trump watched as comey slammed him for being a liar who did fire him because he refused to drop the russia investigation comey also admitted that he leaked his memos that covered conversations he had with trump  he gave the memos to friends and instructed them to give them to the new york times and trump decided to whine about it on twitter while also declaring that he has been vindicated despite so many false statements and lies  total and complete vindication and wow  comey is a leaker   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    that trump has not been vindicated at all  he interfered in a federal investigation in order to save his own ass  that s not something innocent people do but it turns out that trump may have committed obstruction of justice by attacking comey on twitter  and alo because trump s white house is demanding that the justice department investigate comey for the leaks according to whistleblower protection attorney stephen kohn  initiating an investigation because you don t like somebody s testimony could be considered obstruction and in the whistleblower context  it s both evidence of retaliation and  under some laws  could be an adverse retaliatory act itself  indeed  even attacking comey on twitter is considered obstruction because   this is a chilling effect on people not to talk about conversations they had with the president that are not classified as a matter of law   kohn said   that is illegal   that is unconstitutional  in short  trump is intimidating people to remain silent about him and what he says and does  and that s against the law  not everything the president says or does is classified information  comey s memos certainly are not classified  plus  comey is now a private citizen so the justice department has no authority over him  in short  trump shot himself in the foot when he fired comey if trump forces the justice department to go after comey  it would be a gross abuse of power designed for the sole purpose of retaliating against someone he considers an enemy  doing such a thing would also scare other people in the government from speaking out  that s obstruction  and trump should be impeached for it twitter even mocked trump for being such a sore loser comey asked the ag that he never be left alone with you  because you would pressure him and then lie  that s obstruction of justice  sad   dave hogg     stareagle  june    stop lying  comey is known for his honesty  you are known  world wide  for being a pathological liar  https   t co vqnevwypmr  jack schofield   jackschofield  june    s not leaking if what he was sharing wasn t classified  comey shared his recollection of conversations trump had discussed on national tv pic twitter com   robert maguire   robertmaguire  june    who else leaked secrets of private prez meeting  pic twitter com   melissa jo peltier   melissajpeltier  june    believe you re confused   realdonaldtrump  maybe this helps  vin di ca tion  the action of clearing someone of blame or suspicion   votevets   votevets  june     realdonaldtrump   did u get ur phone back  is twitter time out over  a guy that pees on prostitutes should not use  leaker  as a taunt  rosie   rosie  june    image  win mcnamee getty images
