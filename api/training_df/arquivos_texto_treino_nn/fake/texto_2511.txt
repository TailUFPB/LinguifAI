the donald trump administration is beginning to represent an  horror film   the leak is coming from inside the  white  house and at least one is coming from one of trump s most trusted people  kellyanne conway according to cnn as told to them by trusted sources  conway is trying to throw white house press secretary sean spicer under the bus spicer  who  more than even conway  is the public face of the trump administration  has become a national laughing stock  especially after being played  far too accurately  by melissa mccarthy on saturday night live the narrative is that trump is unhappy with spicer and that the fact that he was so easily played by a woman shows him as  weak  of course  there s also the fact that the media absolutely hates the guy who often berates them and pretty much always lies  could it be  though  that the rumors of spicer s demise are premature and that it s all a plot by conway to rid her of at least one of the people she s always having to defend so where is the narrative coming from  spicer declined to comment on the record for this article  but bannon and priebus dismissed the leaks about his fate as scuttlebutt from lower level staff  or maybe  the media  the opposition party  was just making it up  bannon said many people sympathetic to spicer in and out of the white house believe otherwise  five of these sources think the person behind the leaks is kellyanne conway  trump s ever visible white house counselor  though they offer no hard evidence  they say conway is trying to offload blame for administration setbacks on spicer to prove she is the more effective public advocate and earn a lasting place in the president s inner circle  she s clearly guiding a press narrative that he s not up for the job  and that they re reviewing other candidates   one gop strategist said   it s becoming abundantly clear that kellyanne is making sean s job impossible  source  cnnconway denies all of this  saying that  sean has my full support   the white house says the same of spicer of course  the trump administration would be far from the first to put a public happy face on a tumultuous situation  but there are several reasons to believe that spicer might be on the way out  but the only one that really matters is that spicer is embarrassing an already teetering on the edge presidency  in other words  it s likely that the leaks are right   spicer s days are numbered  whether or not that comes from conway is another question  however  if she s leaking this  it means the loyalty is eroding and bigger leaks could be in her future featured image via pool getty images
