maine governor paul lepage has made quite a name for himself with his casual  yet blatant  racism  but when someone calls him out on his bigoted remarks  he apparently gets his feelings hurt because he is such a  sensitive  guy underneath his hardened exterior  well  what does he do when someone tells the truth and his feelings  why  he throws a temper tantrum of course lepage said on wednesday that he was just downright crushed when he heard the news that maine lawmaker drew gattine had called him a racist  turns out this wasn t even true  but lepage  being ever so devastated that he was called a racist for saying racist things  decided to respond by leaving a voicemail for gattine calling him a  c cksucker  and a  son of a b tch  don t forget  though  lepage is the one we should feel sorry for  he s the  sensitive  soul who just happens to say incredibly insensitive  racist stuff  but dammit  calling him a racist just goes too far  it hurts his feels  i may not supposed to be that sensitive to these things  but i am   lepage confessed   i lose sleep over this  and it s frustrating when you hear people talk about cheap political stunts to hurt their opponent and not do the right thing  being called a racist was a horrible thing for me  it was enormously hurtful  it hurt my family  so just what does the good governor plan to do about all this  maybe try to stop spouting all the disgustingly racist things that have a habit of pouring out of his mouth  nope  he s sensitive  just like a baby  so he s throwing a temper tantrum and has announced that he isn t going to talk to the press anymore so that he doesn t get  caught  saying these racist things  that ll teach the media  i will no longer speak to the press ever again after today   lepage said   and i m serious  everything will be put in writing  i am tired of being caught   the gotcha moments  lepage made headlines when he said that all black people are drug dealers with names like  d money  smoothie  shifty  who come to his great state to  impregnate young white girls   he has ranted about immigrants working in restaurants  saying he needs  an interpreter  to understand them  then last week he declared that he is at  war  and naturally  he outright declared that blacks and hispanics are the  enemy  featured image via youtube
