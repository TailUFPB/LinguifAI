paul lepage  who might as well be maine s version of donald trump  is becoming well known for his racist attacks on people of color  he especially can t stand black people or latinos  and went so far as to call them  the enemy   in other words  he sees a race war in which white people are the  good  side  and black and hispanic people are the  evil  side  look  a bad guy is a bad guy  i don t care what color it is  when you go to war  if you know the enemy  the enemy dresses in red and you dress in blue  you shoot at red  don t you  you shoot at the enemy  you try to identify the enemy  and the enemy right now  the overwhelming majority right now coming in are people of color or people of hispanic origin  i can t help that  i just can t help it  those are the facts  there s no implication there  he said  flat out  that the enemy right now is the black and hispanic people coming into his state  those are  the facts  on his twisted planet  the true facts are that he s a racist prick  we can t help that lepage has claimed that  percent of the people arrested for drugs in his state are black or hispanic   data based on a binder of mug shots he allegedly keeps  maine is  percent white  but lepage justifies his racism by saying that people of color are all criminals the actual state prison statistics for maine paint a fairly grim picture  per   residents  maine has  white people incarcerated   hispanics incarcerated  and an astonishing  black people incarcerated that s a prison population that s roughly  percent black  and  percent hispanic  so lepage s   percent  comment is actually not far off however  in a state that s  percent white  that s really sick and lepage trots out these statistics specifically to perpetuate hate against people of color  when in reality the disparity is largely due to racism in the justice system the aclu of maine has a problem with this  obviously  because it means that maine police are nine times more likely to arrest a person of color than they are to arrest a white person  even though whites and people of color deal drugs at about the same rate  despite that pesky little fact  lepage is implying that maine is in an all out war against people of color for no other reason than he s a racist dick featured image by maine dept  of education  licensed under cc by sa   via flickr
