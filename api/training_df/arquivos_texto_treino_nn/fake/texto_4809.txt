so trump is going to visit a black church in detroit this weekend  but his campaign seems to be very uneasy about it  why else would they script answers to the pre selected questions that bishop wayne jackson will ask him  seriously  that s what they did  the new york times obtained a copy  and it sounds nothing like trump it s not uncommon for campaigns to submit pre written questions that they want a specific interviewer to ask  it is unusual  though  for a campaign to take this step  to say nothing of involving their party s national committee in the scripting process  trump  lauded by the crazies on the right and his campaign staff as merely  freewheeling   and  unscripted   reverts into racism  sexism and childish personal attacks without scripts  of course  that has the gop terrified the first question that bishop jackson will ask  according to the times  is   are you a christian and do you believe the bible is an inspired word of god  trump has always had trouble with questions like that  seeing as how he s really not very christian  he can t name his favorite bible verses and has fallen flat on his backside when asked about his faith and the bible  his scriptwriters hope to gloss over all of that with the following answer  if  indeed  it can be called that   as i went through my life  things got busy with business  but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of god  his family  which of his three wives does that answer refer to  it s like they re trying to make evangelicals forget that he thinks wives are disposable anyway they also want him to say  i treasure my relationship with my family  and through them  i have a strong faith enriched by an ever wonderful god  har de har har another question is   what he would say to undecided black voters  this answer is more trumpian  and less christian than the previous because it ends with a silly lie of a boast  if you want a strong partner in this journey  you will vote for me  i will never let you down  by the way  my support is now up to  percent and climbing  let s be clear  trump s favorability rating with the black community had reached the lofty dregs of zero less than a week ago  but  this is the gop  when the truth  or even distorted versions of the truth  don t work  lie  then get all righteously indignant when someone has the gall to point that lie out they want him to give this half answer when asked what his vision is for the black community  if we are to make america great again  we must reduce  rather than highlight  issues of race in this country   and  i want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance   and they want him to avoid the word  racism  altogether  even though he s likely to be asked outright whether he s racist interestingly enough  that script isn t the only thing the campaign is doing to keep trump from tripping over his own tarnished silver tongue here  the interview will air on bishop jackson s television network a week after it takes place so the campaign has time to edit it yes  they want to be able to edit it  when trump is reading prepared remarks  he either sounds lifeless and bored  or he goes off script anyway  so they re prepping for that very strong possibility  they need this interview to reflect what the campaign wants  and not what trump really thinks in short  this is the gop trying to spin trump s racism into something grand and good  it s also nothing but a show   it s not a real attempt at outreach  and really  why should it be  the gop is made up of racists who must cater to the racists  they re kin  after all featured image by aaron p  bernstein getty images
