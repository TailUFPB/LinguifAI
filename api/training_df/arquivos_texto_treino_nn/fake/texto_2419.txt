republicans have been coming up with some pretty ridiculous reasons for why they think we need to ban muslims and build that stupid wall  donald trump and his administration have taken to making up fake terrorist attacks  which is sad enough  but now  we apparently have to worry about people smuggling nuclear weapons into our country   hidden inside bales of marijuana  no less rep  trent franks did an interview with cnn on wednesday and was trying to explain why we need trump s border wall  sadly  he was being completely serious when he made this ridiculous assertion  we sometimes used to make the point that if someone wanted to smuggle a dangerous weapon into america  even a nuclear weapon  how would they do it   he said   the suggestion is  maybe we ll hide it in a bale of marijuana  there are national security implications here for a porous border  as a group of nations  we need to understand that america is the world s flagship of freedom  if we don t have a secure border  that hurts everyone in the long run  as absurd as this idea is  this isn t the first time it has been suggested that someone could sneak in a nuclear weapon by stuffing it inside bales of pot  earlier this month  rep  brad sherman made the comment that  missile defense is ok politically  but remember you can smuggle a nuclear weapon inside a bale of marijuana  as david kay of the international atomic energy agency explains  the scenario might not be as ridiculous as it sounds on the surface  i ve often said  my preferred method for delivering a nuclear device is  i would hide it in a bale of marijuana  contract it out to the drug lords and move it   he said  marijuana is a good shielder actually for radiation  the drug lords have a superb record for delivery  they re not fed ex  but they re awfully close to it  and contract it out and get it across the border  even frank ciluffo  the director of george washington university s homeland security policy institute  floated the idea back in   if you want to smuggle in a tactical nuclear weapon  just put it in a bale of marijuana   ciluffo said   because we re not doing that well in terms of some of our drug enforcement  luckily  we won t have to worry about any of this because trump is going to build his massive wall and no bad people will ever be able to get into our country again you can watch frank s cnn interview  here featured image via video screen capture
