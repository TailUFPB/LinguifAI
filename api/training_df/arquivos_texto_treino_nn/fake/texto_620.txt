i mean  that headline  right  did someone actually say that at this point  you shouldn t be surprised  donald trump is a conspiracy spouting  heartless  right wing douchebag  why wouldn t every single member of his administration be  now  i have a pretty special hate for steve bannon  because i have a crippling fear of toad men  a holdover from a game of charades with my great uncle eivind when i was eight   but coming in at a very close second for my deep seeded loathing is sebastian gorka  a dude who wears nazi paraphernalia in public and is probably totally a really real nazi  you guys for some reason  news people keep inviting gorka to come say horrible things on their shows  and he keeps not letting anyone down  monday  it was msnbc s ali velshi and stephanie ruhle who were tasked with tolerating gorka s condescending bullshit for a few minutes  and he was just full of witty goodness  when the hosts asked him why donald trump had not yet made a public statement about the terrorist bombing in minnesota  you could see the disgust and contempt on his face there s a great rule  all initial reports are false  you have to check them and find out who the perpetrators are  we ve had a series of crimes committed  alleged hate crimes by right wing individuals in the last six months that turned out to be propagated by the left  let s allow the local authorities to provide their assessment and then the white house will make its comments there is a lot to unpack there  i suggest we just focus on the obvious  that there s been exactly one attack  propagated by the left  in the last six months  and it was never at any point presumed to have been a right winger  like  we knew within the hour what political campaign the guy had worked for let s not do too much separation here  though  gorka is part and parcel of an administration that would say all the same things  no matter who the talking head was  this is an administration that is seriously trying to pretend like a bomb thrown through a mosque window  might actually have been some alex jones like  false flag  perpetrated by someone on the left that s despicable  here s a better question  guys  why does it matter who did it before you call it terrorism watch the exchange here read more featured image via alex wong getty images
