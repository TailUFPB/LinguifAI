if you were bored on thursday night at around  et and felt the need to peruse president trump s twitter feed  you might ve instead encountered a blue page bearing the message   sorry  that page doesn t exist    eventually just replaced with an even more generic looking response yes  for a whole  minutes donald trump s twitter account was down twitter is sometimes seen as that one avenue where voyeurs and sociopaths can coexist so it comes as no surprise that the medium is a favorite of president trump s  as well as his supporters and critics alike  it is where we get to see the truly uncensored leader  not following a script  just posting exactly what comes to mind and digging his hole deeper with every tweet  a normal day for trump generally begins by taking to twitter to attack democrats  north korea and  of course  kneeling nfl players before he starts his presidential duties however  some have grown tired of trump s early morning poop tweets and one person decided to take action  that s right  this wasn t the result of some glitch of sorts  but was actually an inside job  to be more specific  it was the work of a heroic twitter employee on their last day on the job  twitter initially released a statement saying the president s feed was inadvertently deactivated due to a human error   but it didn t take long for the truth to come out earlier today  realdonaldtrump s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a twitter employee  the account was down for  minutes  and has since been restored  we are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again   twitter government   twittergov  november    our investigation we have learned that this was done by a twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee s last day  we are conducting a full internal review  https   t co mlarogiarf  twitter government   twittergov  november     the twittersphere initially went into conspiracy mode when they couldn t access trump s account  with the common assumption being that the president had finally been booted from the platform  many have requested that president trump be banned from twitter under the belief that his tweets about north korea could be bringing the united states closer to the brink of nuclear war  something twitter has declined to do  claiming they must weigh the newsworthiness of trump s tweets with its violent rhetoric instead  on this occasion  it was just a twitter employee having the intestinal fortitude to do what many have probably fantasized about doing on their last day of work featured image via screenshot
