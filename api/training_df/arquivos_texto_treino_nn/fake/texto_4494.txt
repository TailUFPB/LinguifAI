win or lose  the fact that donald trump was able to win the republican presidential primary says a lot about the future of the gop  as much as many republicans don t want to admit it  they ve allowed their party to slip into the hands of the extreme far right  and at this point  there s really no turning back appearing on real time with bill maher  former mitt romney adviser lanhee chen explained that there are republicans  like romney  you seek to right the ship  so to speak  he said  after this election  the republican party does have some soul searching to do  but to say that it is permanently changed implies that i think  will have some permanent influence on how we think about the world  and i think  from the perspective of someone who hopes that isn t true   i hope that isn t true  however  maher pointed out that the problem isn t so much coming from within the establishment of the republican party  but rather from the voting base it s been so desperate to attract to gain power  maher said  i mean they didn t want trump  a lot of them  and we see a lot of these vichy republicans who go along because they don t want to upset the apple cart  they know better  they know where their bread is buttered  where their voters are  but you can get rid of the trump  you can t get rid of the voter  that s who they want  then when chen desperately tries to say that all they need to do is reach out to more people and attract new voters  maher said  that s not what the base wants  the base is deplorable  the current gop base  the base that elected trump to be its party s nominee  wants it to be the white power organization that it has drifted into becoming  the republican party had the chance to oust the far right crazy mindset  but they allowed a circus of a primary with  candidates  which then led to a small majority gaining behind trump while all the other votes were dispersed  they should have unified behind a solid candidate and trump wouldn t have stood a chance  talking about outreach now is way too little too late  the republican party  as it was  is over  especially if trump wins in november watch the full segment here featured image via video screen capture
