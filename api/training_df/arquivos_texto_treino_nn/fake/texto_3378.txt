reports are surfacing that cnbc s larry kudlow is on the short list of candidates for chairman the council of economic advisers  which is the government s top economic policy group  kudlow isn t just an advocate of the failed trickle down theory of economics  he also claimed  back in   that no recession was coming  as we all know   proved him dead wrong  and now trump wants him in a top economic position according to craig harrington  director of the economic policy program at media matters for america  this is how bad kudlow is  according to the national bureau of economic research  nber   an award winning nonprofit research organization that is perhaps best known for determining a chronology of american business cycles and recessions  the great recession began in december   yet kudlow published blogs on december     and  of that year titled  the recession debate is over    there ain t no recession   and  bush boom continues   in the conservative national review  by july   as the unemployment rate continued to balloon in the seventh month of recession  kudlow was still arguing in national review that there was no recession or housing crisis  in  the recession debate is over  kudlow claimed that the jobs numbers and business profits added up to no recession at all  in  there ain t no recession   he doubled down on all of that  and in  bush boom continues   he actually said that last one was published on dec      eight months earlier  we began to see serious signs of an economic crahs with new century financial corp   a major subprime lender  filing for bankruptcy  unemployment began rising in dec    and the fed lowered short term interest rates for the fifth time in four months kudlow didn t see any of that  he was focused entirely on the november jobs reports and business profits  he totally ignored other economic indicators  he s almost as bad as those who look only at the stock market for an idea of how our economy is doing moving on from kudlow s absurdly incorrect predictions  in feb    president bush signed the first economic stimulus package into law  and then in march  the financial industry began crashing with the collapse of bear stearns  in april   the fed reduced interest rates yet again  and then in september  lehmann brothers collapsed we all remember the chaos of the rest of  this is more than simply putting someone who will work hard to make the rich richer and the poor poorer into an economic advisory position  this is someone whose economic experience and ideas are so far off that he couldn t  or wouldn t  see a recession coming despite the housing bubble collapse beginning in late  most economists worth their salt could see that foreshadowed the great recession  and knew that the great recession began at the end of   although trump was  excited  for the housing crash because it meant more money for him  however  what can we expect from a president elect who seems to see the presidency as just another reality show  kudlow has published no scholarly papers on economics  and has no degree in economics at all  so he s not exactly qualified for the top economic position in our government he plays an economist on television  though  and that s enough for trump  many of his cabinet picks seem to say that he has to know people from television in order to consider them for his cabinet  kudlow is just another possibility that shows trump has no idea what he s doing and thinks this is just another reality show featured image by gage skidmore  cc by sa   via flickr
