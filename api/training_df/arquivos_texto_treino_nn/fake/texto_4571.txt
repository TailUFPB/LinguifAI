a recent special report by james trimarco for yes  magazine has shined a spotlight on the way that certain banking institutions have perpetuated cycles of poverty and institutionalized economic racism  it also shows how a very specific set of banks are working to smash those systems  these banks are called community development financial institutions  cdfis  traditional banks have only one goal to make a profit  they are also incredibly racist  locking people of color out from being able to access capital  research from mit in  found that lack of access to capital is the number one driving factor in racial disparities across a range of economic metrics such as profits and employment cdfis are not purely profit motivated  so they can serve areas that traditional banks won t  particularly in rural areas and communities of color   trimarco looked at how cdfi s are changing lives in the poorest region in the poorest state in the u s    the mississippi delta region  he writes  mississippi has more cdfis per capita than any other state  its financial ecosystem is a unique place  where bankers and residents are coming to see one another as allies despite a difficult history  it s a window into what the united states might look like if the government actively recruited banks and credit unions as allies in the fight against poverty  cdfis trace their roots back to the  century  with the establishment of black owned financial institutions  throughout more than a century  the idea and mission behind these predecessors have expanded dramatically  one of the biggest changes came with the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  this created the cdf fund  it is used to help fund the now more than   cdifs there are in the united states  the fund started with   million dollars and has grown to more than   million dollars  in order to become a cdfi and access that fund  a financial institution must spend at least   of their assets in low income areas these not just for profit intuitions work on programs such as teaching financial literacy  credit lending and helping people create worker owned co ops cdfis rarely get much attention in the political spotlight  in the  election  only two candidates addressed the issue seriously  believe it or not  neither of them was running on the republican ticket  hillary clinton  the now democratic presidential nominee vowed to double investment into cdfis  her then rival  bernie sanders  supported a more ambitious  though not unpragmatic  plan to turn post offices into de facto versions of cdfis whether they remain as they are now  or they continue to evolve and become integrated into the post office  these types of institutions are desperately needed in the united states  they are an idea whose time has come and then been proven to be essential for more than a century featured image from spencer platt getty images
