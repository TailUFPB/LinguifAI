trump has been tweeting about hurricane irma sort of for the last couple of days  his tweets mostly consist of bragging that his emergency teams are ready and telling people to stay safe  but while he s pretending to be concerned  he s also sending out messages begging people for donations  not to the charities and rescue organizations that are  and will be  on the ground in florida during and after irma  but to himself and his  campaign he s not even making a pretense of asking for donations to help him help those in irma s path  seriously  this is what he s sending out to his followers the link in the above image goes to the donation page on trump s campaign site  where a video again attacks career politicians and the media  and goes into his usual spiel about  let s finish the job   and  make america great again   it s ridiculously tone deaf in light of how many are scrambling to aid those in irma s path he bragged about his response to the devastation of hurricane harvey  but he s not really doing anything but tweeting about irma and closing mar a lago ahead of landfall  he s made a facebook video that  like his tweets  urges people to get out of irma s way  but many don t have that choice the federal government has three major relief efforts to deal with right now  ongoing recovery efforts in texas and louisiana  live saving efforts in puerto rico and the u s  virgin islands  where irma has already hit   and evacuation and preparation efforts in florida  which is more or less closed and in chaos trump will  monitor  irma from the safety of camp david and beg for donations to his campaign instead of do some real work his timing for this kind of a message is especially poor  if he wants to ask for donations  fine  but he should be directing people to donate to the non profits and other organizations that are on the ground everywhere in irma s path and put his stupid  vapid campaign on hold  his priorities are clear  and they do not lie with the american people featured image via win mcnamee getty images
