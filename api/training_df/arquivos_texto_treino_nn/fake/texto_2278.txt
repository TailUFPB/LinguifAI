donald trump has access to a wealth of information as president  but seems content relying on breitbart and other slimy right wing propaganda mills as the sole source of what he thinks are facts  recently  the donald dissolved into a complete mess after a breitbart article began circulating among his staff that claimed obama tapped trump tower s  wires    something the president  no matter whom it is  can not do  to clear up the confusion  cnn s jake tapper reached out to trump administration officials  and it turns out that  yes  the situation is just as stupid as it seems  donald trump did get his  news  from breitbart  not the wealth of government information to which he has access  wh officials with whom i spoke said potus got the info about wiretap from media   breitbart  levin   not from govt sources   tapper tweeted sunday wh officials with whom i spoke said potus got the info about wiretap from media   breitbart  levin   not from govt sources   jake tapper   jaketapper  march    obviously fbi doj wiretap of potus would be huge story  one illegally ordered by previous potus even bigger  but wh officials have no proof   he added obviously fbi doj wiretap of potus would be huge story  one illegally ordered by previous potus even bigger  but wh officials have no proof  jake tapper   jaketapper  march    says that most reporters are  digging on this  but everyone to whom they have spoken in the intelligence community  like the rest of us  has no idea what the f ck trump is talking about   moreover we cannot pretend we haven t been here before  w potus putting out wild accusations that are untethered to reality   tapper adds  listing a few examples of many   obama s birth certificate  vaccines  ted cruz s father   lee harvey oswald   crowd sizes  vince foster   murder rate     illegal votes   moreover we cannot pretend we haven t been here before  w potus putting out wild accusations that are untethered to reality   jake tapper   jaketapper  march    obama s birth certificate  vaccines  ted cruz s father   lee harvey oswald   crowd sizes  vince foster   murder rate     illegal votes  jake tapper   jaketapper  march    in any case  will continue to report  wh call for congress to find evidence of potus claim with  no further comment  is not proof   tapper says  adding that he has requested an interview with president obama to clear the matter up  which totally needs to happen and promises to be hilarious  journalists are not alone in being baffled by trump s ridiculous claim that the former president ordered a wiretap which  once again  he could not do  on sunday  vocal obama opponent marco rubio said he has no idea where trump s claim comes from either  i m not sure what it is he is talking about   rubio says   perhaps the president has information that is not yet available to us or to the public  and if it s true  obviously we re going to find out very quickly  and if it isn t  then obviously he ll have to explain what he meant by it  unfortunately  as tapper notes  the information wasn t a closely held government secret  it was the result of the ravings of a known far right conspiracy theorist who has admitted he doesn t even have the evidence to back his claims  he just wants to see obama investigated president obama should do the interview  he s so past the point of caring what these idiots think that it should be hilarious featured image via getty images
