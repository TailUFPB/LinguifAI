white house press secretary sean spicer was completely humiliated by msnbc s hallie jackson during tuesday s white house briefing  jackson wanted to know why donald trump would call on congress to investigate the supposed wiretapping at trump tower when he claims to already have this very information  this was a question spicer couldn t answer  all he could do was squirm  you said the president stands by his tweets saturday morning that president obama ordered this wiretap   jackson stated   you ve also said that the president wants congress to investigate  some members of congress  by the way  have asked the white house and asked the president to come forward with the information  so bottom line  why would the president want congress to investigate for information he already has   she asked spicer started blubbering about the importance of  separation of powers  but came nowhere near actually addressing the issue at hand jackson wasn t about to let him off the hook that easy  though  she continued to press spicer  wondering  if the president has the info  sean   and i guess that s what i m trying to get to   if he s sitting on this information that he found out  he s now directing or asking or recommending that the intelligence committees look into this  and you talked about they have resources and staff  which they do  but why expend those resources and staff if the president found out this information and has it  spicer then explained that trump thinks congress asking the justice department to conduct an investigation might  add credibility to the look  of trump s bogus accusation that former president obama tapped his phones during the election  i think we ve made it very clear how he wants this done   spicer finally concluded when he could think of nothing better to say watch sean spicer be completely humiliated by msnbc s hallie jackson featured image via mark wilson getty images
