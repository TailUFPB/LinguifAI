it was hard to imagine donald trump getting any dumber during his presidential campaign  but he s truly outdone himself in the weeks after winning the election  not only has the president elect been unintelligently tweeting up a storm  ditching protocol press pools and making every attempt to hide the   million lawsuit he just settled for fraud  but he is letting america know that he has no idea what presidents actually do we ve seen trump s complete ignorance of widely known facts before  like the time he told his own supporters the incorrect voting date  at a florida rally  trump had   with full confidence   told his fanbase to vote on november   a full  days off from the real voting date  today  trump reminded us of this moment when he reinforced the fact that he still doesn t know what s going on this morning  trump notified everyone over twitter that there would be a meeting at trump tower today with the people  aka the white supremacists   who will run our government  for the next eight years  huh  great meetings will take place today at trump tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next  years  twittereither trump is completely unaware that a president s term is only four years  or he s completely delusional about how long he s actually going to last in the white house  we wouldn t be surprised if trump thinks one term is actually  years  considering how clueless he is and his lack of knowledge about the united states constitution  which clearly says  the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america  he shall hold his office during the term of four years  and  together with the vice president chosen for the same term for him to think that he s going to have the success that president obama had and be elected for two terms is hilarious  obama has a tremendously high approval rating  and trump s approval rating is historically low  he s certainly in for a rude awakening if he thinks he s got eight years of dictatorship ahead of him featured image via win mcnamee getty images
