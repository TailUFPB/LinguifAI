you know how donald trump stubbornly refuses to release his tax returns  well  the california state assembly told him to f ck off last week when they passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns before they are allowed on the state s ballot the presidential tax transparency and accountability act passed   in the assembly and now heads to the state senate  if and when it passes there  it will head to the governor s desk for his signature  president trump s blatant disregard for the tradition of releasing tax returns is dangerous to our democracy   says state sen  mike mcguire  one of the bill s co authors  for decades  every president has put their personal beliefs aside and put our country first and released their returns  sb  helps to reestablish desperately needed transparency in the white house  and we are looking forward to seeing the governor s signature on the bill   he says of the bill  which would require at least five years of returns from candidates  as the months continue to go by in the disastrous trump administration and the investigations and conflicts of interest pile up  it becomes more and more clear how critical basic transparency is in how we elect our president   another co author of the bill  state senator scott wiener  said  adding that this would give  the american people the honesty and transparency they deserve  it s unlikely that trump would win california in the first place  but it s looking like if he wants to do it in california he will need to cough up his returns featured image via getty images alex wong
