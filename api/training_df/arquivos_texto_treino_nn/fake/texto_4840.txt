a right wing radio host has called it quits after he got owned by famous scientist neil degrasse tyson last week  neal larson learned the hard way that there are humiliating consequences for spreading satire as a fact when the famous scientist fact checked him into oblivion  i ve listened to neil degrasse tyson before   larson wrote in the twin falls times news criticizing the astrophysicist for performing some interesting mathematics in relation to the olympic medal count but larson went beyond that by accusing tyson of mocking a little girl for wanting to live on jupiter  and what i observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating  in one of his worse moments  tyson mocked a  year old girl who suggested she d like to live on jupiter  he ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd  then later  several times  on twitter  that told me everything i needed to know about neil degrasse tyson for that moment he was just a horse s astrophysicist  naturally  tyson did a little research and then responded to larson with some bad news  the  incident  with a  old girl never happened  it looks to be a hoax  no such tweets ever existed on november     or on any other day  so you abrogated your journalistic integrity by not verifying what you read in somebody else s article  before using it as a foundational pillar in yours  tyson s response went viral and humiliated the hell out of larson to the point where he is now throwing in the towel to end his stint as a columnist in what is now his final column  larson admitted that he was checkmated by tyson in one move  the instant it was picked up nationally  i was checkmated   larson wrote before playing the victim   i had no recourse  no comparable media platform at my disposal  it was as terrible and as helpless as you can imagine  even more disappointing  a few people that i honestly thought were friends  shared online my unfortunate story with glee  seriously  how about practicing what you conservatives constantly preach to the rest of us and take some damn personal responsibility for once  after all  you re the one who printed satire as if it were fact  mr  larson  a simple look at the original source of the story would have been enough to figure out that it was fake  and you fell for it because you lack journalistic skills and integrity  which makes me wonder why the hell the twin falls times news let you get anywhere near their newspaper but despite apologizing to tyson for the blunder and the slander  larson continued playing the victim throughout his last foray in print news  for those in the national spotlight  this is probably old hat  but i wasn t equipped to handle the influx  logistically or emotionally   larson wrote   if anyone had sent a kind word or more gentle and constructive criticism  i apologize because i probably missed it in the onslaught of hate  again  you slandered a man in an attempt to tarnish his reputation  mr  larson  you re lucky he didn t sue your ass on the spot because he damn sure has a bulletproof case against you  and yet you think you re the victim here neil degrasse tyson is an internationally recognized celebrity scientist  did you honestly think your accusation would not become national news  especially once your target debunked your claim with facts neal larson brought this humiliation on himself and he has no one to blame but himself for negative feedback he received now if only tyson would monitor larson s radio show and debunk the bullshit he spews on the airwaves  perhaps larson would be embarrassed enough to quit that job and go into hiding permanently featured image via addicting info
