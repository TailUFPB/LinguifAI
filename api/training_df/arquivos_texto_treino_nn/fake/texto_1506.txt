prior to the nov   election  the fbi was  more or less  trumpland  they wanted trump to win  they neither trusted nor approved of hillary clinton  and that anti hillary attitude led to a number of anti hillary leaks to the press from the agency  they were angry with james comey s decision not to indict hillary over her emails now  though  the fbi is wracked with shock  anger and grief over comey s sudden firing  according to the daily beast  one agent said his abrupt dismissal was like a death in the family  another said that they re basically  sitting shiva   which is a jewish ritual of mourning just after a funeral and some of them are doing something very unusual for a situation like this  they re posting pictures of themselves with comey on social media  and even changing their profile pics to those of comey  that s a gesture generally reserved for someone who dies acting director andrew mccabe told the senate judiciary committee that comey was well liked and had broad support throughout the bureau  in other words  when trump said that comey had lost the trust and respect of his rank and file  he was either not speaking for the majority of the rank and file  or he was flat out lying rank and file agents were also very suspicious of the timing of comey s firing  wondering whether it had anything to do with the russia probes  various officials  phones were ringing off the hook  fbi headquarters in d c  was more or less locked down and not answering the flood of phone calls coming in one agent told the daily beast that there s likely to be serious distrust of whoever trump puts into comey s place  no matter who gets the job  there will be a cloud of suspicion because the president is unpopular with much of the   that bad faith will make it harder to do my job  trump undermined the public s trust in the fbi more than comey ever could  the new director is going to face a tough confirmation  with much of the senate viewing trump with suspicion  too  that makes possible picks like rudy giuliani out of the question   he s going to have to tread very carefully with comey s replacement  in the meantime  mccabe has assured the senate that he ll let them know immediately if the white house tries to interfere with the russia probes in any way at all featured image by zach gibson via getty images
