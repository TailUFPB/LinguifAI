donald trump s war on science drew a response from  the science guy  on saturday morning trump and his team of minions are trying to stop scientists from doing research and sharing the results with the public from the environmental protection agency to the department of energy  trump is systematically dismantling critical research and testing that helps citizens and businesses make decisions and keeps us safe trump is halting water and air quality tests along with climate change research  all of which could mean the difference between life and death for millions of americans as trump moves to approve oil drilling and pipelines and doubles down on coal instead of clean energy sources that will cut pollution and slow the effects of climate change rather than accept real facts  trump and his team are touting what they call  alternative facts   trump and conservatives are living in a delusional world where facts don t matter because they directly contradict their own worldview during a discussion with joy reid  nye explained why trump s rejection of facts is going to take years to reverse and that it will spell  big trouble  for our nation and the world  well  any time you re burning fossil fuels  you authorize more pipelines  you re headed for trouble in the big picture  but in the bigger picture is this thing  you know  this word we love   cognitive dissonance   this phrase  you have a worldview that disagrees with what you observe  so you might expect  if you were as open minded as a scientist  as a scientifically literate voter or taxpayer  you might expect that data would change your mind   but that s not how people are people on either side  the other side and this side  you double down when you find conflict  it s called the  backfire effect   it backfires  and you get more entrenched in your worldview  for example  if somebody believes in astrology  it takes them about two years to get over it  you have to show them over and over there s no such thing as astrology  it doesn t really work  and then they let go  but everybody s expectation that you ll let go in a week is not going to be met so our problem  everybody  is this doubling down  this backfire effect  so we have to work  i think  diligently in the science community to fight back  of course there are the facts  we start with those  but there s this human nature thing on both sides to fight back  we have our bubble over here  they have their bubble over there  here s the video via vidme shutting down our scientists puts americans in danger  we can no longer keep our environment safe if they can not do their jobs and tell us the information we need to know  increased mining and drilling will end up poisoning our lands and water supply and increase the effects of climate change  trump s denial of basic facts is going to get americans killed and that blood will be on his hands and he should be held accountable for it featured image via screenshot
