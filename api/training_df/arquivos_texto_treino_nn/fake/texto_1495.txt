it was the tweet that blew up the internet breaking  trump lawyer  tax returns from past  years show no  income of any type from russian sources   with few exceptions   the associated press   ap  may    headscratching claim by trump s lawyers was that he had  no income of any type  from russia  with few exceptions the exceptions cited don t raise many eyebrows  what is noticeably absent is any mention of the russia megadonors eric trump recently bragged helped finance trump s golf resort  leading one to assume that there are things being intentionally left out of this report   eric trump now denies making this admission  unfortunately eric has been known to lie before  the follow up story published by the associated press was even more bizarre  emphasis added  president donald trump s lawyers say a review of his last  years of tax returns do not reflect  any income of any type from russian sources   with some exceptions the lawyers did not release copies of trump s tax returns so the associated press cannot independently verify their conclusions so trump s lawyers  reviewed  trump s tax returns and   surprise   found that he is completely innocent of any wrongdoing  but they won t let reporters independently verify those findings  so we just have to take their word for it if that s the case  then the law firm doing the investigation better have an absolutely impeccable record  instead  trump got one that has even more connections than he  allegedly   does the lawyers trump turned to work for a firm called morgan lewis  it does a lot of business in russia  it does so much business in russia  in fact  that it actually nabbed a prestigious award for being  russia law firm of the year  in  the law firm that sent the letter re  trump s biz interests in russia was recognized as  russia law firm of the year  in   pic twitter com   frank thorp v   frankthorp  may    argue the law firm is merely a victim of its own success  it s a global company  of course it would be in russia trump letter is dumb for other reasons  but not this  morgan lewis   bockius is one of the biggest   most well known lawfirms in the world  https   t co   jeff b ddhq   esotericcd  may     this needn t be a massive conspiracy  something worth thinking about  this group   which has a vested interest in not upsetting trump and putin   wants us to take their word at facevalue when they say that trump is completely innocent  the very fact that they have business relationships and clients in russia means they would feel pressured to tread lightly  russia  a country run not only by putin but a collective of oligarchs  can destroy your business if they feel antagonized by what you re doing making matters even more shady  trump s lawyers claim they just released these findings at the behest of a congressional request  but the letter they sent is two months old  if it were that old  it may explain why trump s lawyers didn t bother to mention trump s russian golf course investors  they didn t think it would come out  news of that relationship only leaked in the past few weeks but there s an easy way to clear all this up  trump could always release his tax returns to the public featured image via afp out
