by now  we all know that house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes has turned tail and gone off on what his fellow goper in the senate  lindsey graham  r sc  calls an  inspector clouseau investigation   in other words  nunes is a bumbling idiot and a stooge for the trump white house when it comes to investigating ties between officials from donald trump s presidential campaign and russia during the  presidential election well  it now seems that nunes  r ca  might have a bit of a problem come   star trek star and wildly popular  lgbtq rights activist george takei is running for congress   against nunes  the endeavor was largely secret  until takei and his husband were found out as they started scoping out property to buy in nunes s red district  takei says of the move  well  i guess the jig is up   with what is going on now in the country  i couldn t stand by any longer merely as a citizen  i knew i had to take a bigger stand  so that s why i m running for congress  my hope is to challenge davin nunes for his seat in   i think nunes is vulnerable  and i plan to prove that  people are tired of his ass kissing of trump  can i say that  i think i can  these days you can say pretty much anything and not get in trouble  i want to be a champion for all people  but especially those whose voices are not heard often in the halls of congress  we need to build a majority again in congress  too  to be a check against the trump administration s excesses  assuming he s even around by then to keep making horrific mistakes  featured image via frederick m  brown getty images
