donald trump embarrassed himself and the nation yet again when he hosted israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on wednesday and cnn host fareed zakaria blasted trump for being woefully unprepared throughout the press conference  it appeared that trump was making it up as he went along  often needing netanyahu to jump in to answer questions  you can t get a sense whether this was a seriously thought out issue or  as happens so much with donald trump  he was just kind of winging it   zakaria told don lemon on whether he supports the two state solution  trump bragged that he and netanyahu will strike a bigger deal zakaria pointed out that the kind of deal trump is talking about has been on the table for  years since the arab league offered to recognize israel s existence in exchange of the creation of an independent palestinian state so let s just get this straight  a group of arab nations offered israel peace and all israel had to do is go through with the two state solution  seriously  clearly  israel is standing in the way of peace anyway  zakaria also had a problem with trump s answer to a question about the rise of anti semitism since he was elected  trump responded by bragging about his electoral college win and then mentioned that he has jews in his family as if that s supposed to make everyone feel better about the rising anti semitism zakaria said that all trump had to do is condemn anti semitism and call out any of his supporters who are contributing to its rise  but to that would mean angering all of the white nationalists  including steve bannon  who support him  the whole thing was kind of surreal  and why it was embarrassing to watch a president be so under briefed and by given this assist by the israeli prime minister   zakaria concluded here s the video via youtube donald trump needs to be better prepared for these press conferences  he is not going to be able to wing it for four years  the presidency is not something anyone can just  wing  and be successful at  that s clear considering trump has been a disaster since he first took office he needs to buckle down and start doing his homework  maybe then he ll be able to actually discuss the issues instead of humiliating himself and our country featured image via screenshot
