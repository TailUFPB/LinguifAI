newt gingrich just got owned by the ladies of  the view  on tuesday night  the kelly file host interviewed trump supporter and former house speaker newt gingrich as the pair argued about the accuracy of polls that show donald trump getting his his ass beat by hillary clinton  kelly pointed out that trump hasn t exactly been helping himself when it comes to the women s vote due to his comments about groping women and the sexual assault allegations that have been raining down on him ever since when kelly suggested that trump may be a sexual predator  gingrich exploded and flew into a disrespectful rage against her  i m sick and tired of people like you using language that s inflammatory that s not true   gingrich yelled while wagging his finger at kelly   when you use the words  you took a position  and i think it s very unfair of you to do that  megyn  i think that is exactly the bias people are upset by you are fascinated with sex and you don t care about public policy  that s what i get out of watching you tonight  kelly responded by telling gingrich that he doth protests too much and then ended the interview by telling him to go deal with his anger issues whoopi goldberg and her co hosts absolutely loved the way kelly handled herself and the way she humiliated gingrich candace cameron bure said she admired kelly for standing up to gingrich  only to then ruin the moment by agreeing with him that the media is biased goldberg replied by pointing out that the media took bill clinton to task back in the  and that she would love to hear trump talk about policy if he could ignore every little slight against him long enough to do so bure then complained because trump isn t getting positive coverage from the media  only to get smacked down because hillary clinton is talking the way trump is on the campaign trail then joy behar chimed in with the praise of the day to save the segment from going down the rabbit hole  megyn got him  he was bleeding from wherever   behar quipped about gingrich in reference to an attack on kelly made by trump early in the primary when he said she has  blood coming out of her wherever  just because she asked him about the many insults about women he has made over the years   she nailed him  you know what i mean   behar continued   when i watched that  i was like   yes  sara haines also enjoyed watching gingrich get his ass handed to him and remarked that trump only has himself to blame for the way the media is covering him  jedediah bila agreed  newt gingrich needs to watch the kelly file  because she is tough on everyone   bila said   she s not somebody who picks favorites  she s somebody in this business who does her job  it s not her fault that donald trump has said and done some horrible things   that s donald trump s fault  bila concluded by pointing out that if trump  were out there talking policy well and articulating policy well  that would be the story but that s not the story because that s not what he is doing  here s the video via youtube newt gingrich made a huge mistake attacking megyn kelly in the way he did  because it only solidifies the image that trump and his supporters have zero respect for women and that image is killing trump and republicans as a whole in the polls right now featured image  screenshot
