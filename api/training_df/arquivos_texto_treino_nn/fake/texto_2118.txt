 i just want people to know  the cia was hacked  and a lot of things taken   that was during the obama years  that was not during us   trump recently told fox news propagandist tucker carlson during an interview   that was during the obama situation  mike pompeo is there now doing a fantastic job  in saying those words  it appears that the donald did something against which he has been railing ever since his administration began leaking more than two russian prostitutes in a certain orange man s moscow hotel room  he leaked classified information now as president  donald trump can declassify any information he wants  but democratic rep  adam schiff of california points out that trump did not make a purposeful decision  to do that  he just talked  in his effort to once again blame obama  the president appeared to have discussed something that  if true and accurate  would otherwise be considered classified information   schiff said in a press release  the president has the power to declassify whatever he wants  but this should be done as the product of thoughtful consideration and with intense input form any agency affected  for anyone else to do what the president may have done  would constitute what he deplores as  leaks   schiff says  he also took to twitter to rail against mr  number  for applying a different set of rules to himself than others   potus appears to have discussed something that  if true   accurate  would be classified  had it been anyone else he would call it a  leak  pic twitter com   adam schiff   repadamschiff  march     trump doesn t consider little things like his administration s ties to russia to be matters of public interest  or his tax returns  or anything else that could expose him for exactly what he is but if trump is in the business of declassifying information  he could easily answer any questions americans have about russia with a stroke of his pen do it  donald featured image via getty images  pool
