last week  the alleged president made some jaw dropping accusations on twitter  accusing his predecessor of wiretapping his phones before the election  trump did this without offering any proof  after trump s tweetstorm  his team twisted itself into a pretzel in order to try to defend trump s unprecedented attack on his predecessor  meanwhile  former president barack obama literally rolled his eyes after hearing of trump s baseless claims trump s fact free conspiracy theory even garnered the attention of house intelligence committee chair devin nunes  r ca  and ranking member adam schiff  d ca   who gave him until monday to produce evidence to back up his claim  it s worth noting that nunes is a staunch defender of trump s and even went as far as to try to cover up the amateur president s russian influence scandal so he must find this indefensible on monday  white house press secretary sean spicer said that trump  doesn t really think  that barack obama  tapped his phone personally   in an attempt to walk back trump s wild and unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor ordered an illegal wiretap of trump tower  politico reports  he doesn t really think that president obama went up and tapped his phone personally   spicer told reporters at the press briefing spicer tried to use alt words to defend his boss spicer tried to argue that trump had accused the obama administration of general  surveillance  activities  and not a literal wiretap  even though trump himself had use the term  wire tapping  in one of several tweets making the claim without evidence on march   spicer claimed that the fact that trump put quotation marks around the words  wire tapping  in one tweet was proof that he was not speaking literally  i think there is no question that the obama administration  that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the  election  that is a widely reported activity that occurred back then   spicer said   the president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities during that  ah  so if trump used quotes  he did so only one out of three times  then we are not to take him literally  weird  it is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the  election cycle  and now we re wondering where the proof is   spicer added   it is many of the same outlets in this room that talked about the activities that were going on back then  no one knows what spicer is talking about it is unclear what reports spicer was referring to  news outlets have reported that intelligence officials have been investigating whether there were inappropriate ties between the trump campaign and the russian government  as part of the probe into the country s suspected attempts to meddle in the election and regular surveillance on russia s ambassador  they have reportedly intercepted communications between some campaign aides and russian officials there is no proof or credible source which has reported that obama wiretapped and or surveilled donald trump during the campaign as we said  trump only used quotes in one of three tweets  not that that should matter  is it legal for a sitting president to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election  turned down by court earlier  a new low   trump wrote in one tweet  i d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october  just prior to election   another tweet read  how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy   trump wrote in a misspelled tweet so now  trump  s department of justice has asked the chairman and vice chairman of the house intelligence committee for  additional time  to collect evidence to support trump s crazy time claims  meaning  trump doesn t have proof  he just reads fake news sites such as breitbart and gateway pundit then tweets the fake news photo by win mcnamee getty images
