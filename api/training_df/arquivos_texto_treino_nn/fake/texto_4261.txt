donald trump called the atlantic city casino that he is so fond of  the taj mahal  the  eighth wonder of the world   now  the joint is shutting down   likely for good  the shutdown comes after more than  days of striking on the part of union workers from the luxury hotel and casino  as negotiations went from difficult to impossible  it became official  there s no going back  and the taj mahal is closing this really isn t surprising  considering that trump is the king of bankruptcy  and has declared himself bankrupt four times  despite his own ridiculous record  trump told the associated press with regards to the casino s closing that there was  no reason  for it to close  however  he also says it will cost too much to re open  so it s done however  trump s billionaire buddy  carl icahn  who operated the taj mahal  just might be using the cold months to do some negotiating in an effort to save the place and re open it  this is a theory that the union president  bob mcdevitt  is running on  according to mcdevitt  the re opening after renovations and other improvements is a  strong possibility  the taj mahal s closing will cost atlantic city   jobs  bringing to the total to   jobs lost as a result of casino closings in the last two years  however  the workers who are on strike seem optimistic  despite the loss of their jobs and many admittedly being in financial trouble with the holidays coming  tina condos  who served cocktails at trump s joint  says  we stood up to a billionaire and told him we wouldn t take it  i hope it gives him pause before he tries to come in and do this to anyone else  we feel like we succeeded here  rose hall  who took care of the rooms at the adjoining hotel  says  i gave most of my adult life to this place  i had to pay for health care out of my own pocket  and if you don t think that s expensive  you haven t looked  i lost my fiancee to cancer just when medical insurance came off the table for us i m angry about what s happened  but i m not sad about what we did  i m at peace with myself  the last word on the situation from the point of view of the union workers  president  bob mcdevitt is that the workers were in the midst of their popeye moment   that s all i can stands  i can t stands no more   for the first time in  years  workers stood up to carl icahn and made him throw in the towel  well  good on these workers  and may they find other means of employment soon featured image via bobby bank getty images
