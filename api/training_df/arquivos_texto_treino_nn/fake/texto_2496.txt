on thursday afternoon  the world was treated to yet another donald trump press conference   the topic of which was to announce his latest labor secretary pick  he did that  but he did so much more  reporters are in shock  it was combative  it was bombastic  it was nuts  and not in the cute way  this is a man who s clearly not fit to be president of a pta  let alone president of the united states for the moment  though  he is president of the united states and even republicans are secretly mortified at the prospect of having this insane monster at the helm for the next four years  one even texted cnn during the press conference  saying that trump should see a therapist  i got a text from a couple of democrats during the thing  who of course are not inclined to like him   king said thursday   but i got a text from a republican senator who said in this text   he should do this with a therapist  not on live television  how bad was it  well  like most days since trump was elected  he boasted about it and lied about the win  he complained about the media  he suggested that an african american reporter is  friends  with the congressional black caucus and should set up a meeting between trump and the caucus  here s a partial video this senator  who is remaining nameless  is not the first to suggest that trump needs medical help  rep  ted lieu  d ca  has gone so far as to require a mental health professional be on staff for the president  his disconnection from the truth is incredibly disturbing   he said   when you add on top of that his stifling of dissent  his attacks on the free press and his attacks on the legitimacy of judiciary  that then takes us down the road toward authoritarianism  that s why i ve concluded he is a danger to the republic  source  cosmoand this was before today s press conference  the bill  if passed  it likely won t get through the gop congress  would not just be for trump  it would be for all future presidents  first  though  we need to do something about the madman with access to the nuclear codes  we need to do it now  the anonymous republican knows it  they all do featured image via mario tama getty images
