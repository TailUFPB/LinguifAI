sarah palin opened her mouth again and people quickly corrected her stupidity ever since the united nations passed a resolution rightfully condemning israel s continued refusal to stop building new settlements on palestinian land  conservatives have been fuming about it donald trump even threatened the united nations and has been trashing the international organization but now sarah palin is also telling trump to ditch the u n  in a move that would be similar to brexit  in which the united states would pull out of the organization just as the united kingdom pulled out of the european union  a move that millions of uk voters now regret  i think many of us have called for america to really step up and consider what it is that we are funding and supporting via the u n   and how it works so hard really against u s  interests  and just saying   look what the u k  just did   palin told breitbart   this is such an encouraging time  where it s not just us  but those across the pond  too  are understanding that their nation s sovereignty and security are on the line here  with the ties that bind us to interests that really don t further our agendas  yes  god forbid that other nations have opinions  too  when the u k  made its move  it was just another reason to call yet again for the u s  to get the heck out of the u n  and get the u n  out of the u s    palin continued   let s get going on putting america first so that we can sweep our own porch before telling other nations how to sweep theirs  but the united nations does not tell america what to do  u n  resolutions must be approved by the senate to apply to the united states and we have the power to veto resolutions palin then pleaded with trump to pull america out of the united nations  i called for our next president  donald trump  to call for the unshackling of the political bands tying us to the u n   by exiting the u n   where injustice is actually rewarded  we then will be able to uphold america s reputation as the leader  and as the kind and compassionate and generous nation that we are   as the nation sharing values that  when emulated by any other nation  can bring justice and equal rights to any other nation  she then claimed that a revolution put trump in office and that the same revolution will end the peacekeeping organization that has been around since after world war ii  it s our money funding the lion s share of the globalist circus  it s we the people needing to rise up and make this a part of the revolution that we have just so benefited from  last time i checked  it s not a revolution when a presidential candidate loses the popular vote by nearly  million votes and has one of the smallest margins of victory in the electoral vote in history but palin crowed about her interview on twitter and was soon put in her place by people with functioning brains  sarahpalinusa  breitbartnews yeah  i ve been tired of the lack of large scale violent conflict between states   newyearsresolution         december      sarahpalinusa  breitbartnews since the un s creation there hasn t been a global war  how am i wrong   factslivesmatter       december      molliesdadtaken  breitbartnews us paid   million to the un in    for   the price of an aircraft carrier  we have  peace       december    sarahpalinusa  breitbartnews palin should call for herself to go back to her ice cave       kathy palko   chattykay  december    sarahpalinusa if you only knew what that meant   deez nuts   kdogpeele  december    sarahpalinusa you are one scary person   jack bluepnw   bluepnw  december    sarahpalinusa  breitbartnews and you should be shackled to the titanic        december    sarahpalinusa un includes world health organisation  saves us from ebola and other horrors  we all need the un  lev szeps   levszeps  december    sarahpalinusa  breitbartnews really  become isolationists  how stupid is that   maryann horsley     december     not only would america become isolationist  it would be giving up international power and prestige and the power vacuum in the united nations would be filled by russia and china  both of which certainly do not have our best interests at heart there is a reason why we helped found the united nations and getting rid of it now when we need it more than ever before would be a grave error that would put the world on the path to selfishness and the brink of war unlike anything we have ever witnessed featured image via huffington post
