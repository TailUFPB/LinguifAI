the only mistake hillary clinton made when saying half of trump s supporters are a  basket of deplorables  would be in the fact that the number was too low  it would be safe to say at least two thirds of trump supporters are deplorable  racist  misogynistic  islamophobic  and just outright horrible human beings deserved of reprimand if you need further proof of this fact because maybe you ve been living in an underground bunker away from any and all ability to gain access to the news  just take a gander at this video compilation of unfiltered trump supporters being the terrible people that they so naturally are in this video you will hear racial slurs  derogatory language against women and minorities  as well as those going directly after president obama  etc  etc  etc trump has made being a bigot socially acceptable to so many in our nation right now that it should make every person who has a soul in their body nauseous should hillary have said what she said  probably not  but she wasn t wrong watch how absolutely deplorable trump supporters are here  de plor able   very bad in a way that causes shock  fear  or disgust   deserving censure or contempt pic twitter com   shauna   goldengateblond  september    image via video screen capture
