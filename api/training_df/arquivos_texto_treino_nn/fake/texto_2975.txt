according to russian dictator vladimir putin  it s silly to worry about little things like whether or not a couple of russian ladies peed on donald trump s bed because it s much  much worse to publish memos that reveal these allegations putin says that there is a conspiracy to  delegitimize  the man and his team of hackers  fake news writers  and trolls he worked hard to install in the oval office by hacking trump s political opponents and running an aggressive propaganda campaign  i don t know mr  trump  i have never met him  i don t know what he will do in the international arena  so i have no reason either to attack him  criticize him or defend him  putin said at a press conference  donald trump has been with the most beautiful women in the world  so why would he need prostitutes in moscow  to answer that question  we need only look to a  edition of the howard stern show in which trump was reminded that he bragged that he likes to go to russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals  putin says that russian security services  do not chase every us billionaire   and that the release of the documents was worse than prostitutes  in a way  he s right  as the documents presented to both trump and president obama also allege that members of the president elect s campaign staff directly worked with the russian government during the campaign on numerous occasions  trump has repeated russian propaganda while attacking u s  intelligence agencies that have been exposing him for what he is and  of course  has directly quoted putin  a man whom trump says is  very smart   while hurling barbs at hillary clinton trump and putin have been screaming about the  fake news  release of actual documents that actual intelligence agencies are in possession of  but the bbc reported recently that the whole pissing russian ladies thing is just the tip of the iceberg  correspondent paul wood revealed last week that at least four sources have confirmed the information  with one u s  intelligence source informing him that there is audio and video of the donald s escapades  and an israeli news source reports that the country s spies have been warned against sharing information with the united states for fear that trump will relay it to putin putin and trump s bromance is disconcerting at best   especially when more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have confirmed that the man who stood up to join trump in his attacks on our intelligence agencies has been confirmed to have interfered in our election watch it below featured image via getty images
