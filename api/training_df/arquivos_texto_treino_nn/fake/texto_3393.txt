the electoral college should tell donald trump and his deplorable supporters to go f ck themselves the electoral college convenes on december  to cast their votes for president  and it will only take  of them to cast their votes against trump to prevent him from taking office you see  while we have an election every year consisting of electoral votes and the popular vote  all  from all  states are constitutionally required to have the final say on who becomes president  as alexander hamilton explained in the federalist papers  the electoral college is the last line of defense to choose a person who is  to an eminent degree  endowed with the requisite qualifications  to be president of the united states and that is why millions of americans are pleading with the electoral college to exercise their power and vote against donald trump of course  trump supporters are trying to bully and threaten the electors to make sure our country gets destroyed  in fact  an elector in texas reports that trump supporters threatened to rape and murder his family if he doesn t vote the way they want him to vote christopher suprun shared the grisly threat with his fellow elector art sisneros  who shared the threat with texas monthly  you vote for trump or we rape your wife and daughters with a knife before we kill you   the threat reads   do as told or face consequences  sisneros explained that he has also been receiving threats from trump supporters  the trump supporters and the people on the right thought that i absolutely had to vote for trump  and to do otherwise was some kind of treasonous act   he said except that sisneros can vote for whomever he pleases when december  rolled around  and that is getting easier to figure out since left wing groups are reportedly encouraging the electors to choose anyone but trump  even if it s not hillary clinton right wingers and trump supporters  on the other hand  are being downright scary and are acting like the electors are required to vote for trump  they were far more aggressive and far more nasty   sisneros said   i received a lot of threats  i just didn t think it would do any good to share them or make a big deal out of them  there were several nasty ones to vote for trump  or else  some of them were pretty vague like   we re going to hunt you down   that kind of stuff  some were like   we re going to find out where you work and come after you  frankly  threats like these ought to immediately disqualify trump from office  after all  he and his supporters are the ones threatening the electors with dire consequences  this should really make it easy for the electors to reject trump outright  he is a danger to our democracy and his cabinet picks are a threat to our government and democratic institution  trump is even a danger to our continued survival as a free people considering russia interfered with our election and helped trump win so putin can have a puppet in the white house the electoral college has a chance to do what they were designed to do and that is making sure that a demagogue and con artist is prevented from holding the highest office in the land  so the electors need to have courage to save our nation  rejecting trump is the right thing to do featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
