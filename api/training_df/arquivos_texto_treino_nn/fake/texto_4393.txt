democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton has wasted no time using the new york times  bombshell that was dropped on saturday  the revelation was that republican presidential candidate donald trump may have manipulated his taxes to make it so that he has not had to pay income taxes for two decades  now  clinton is trolling trump hard with a special tax calculator that shows exactly how much a person would pay in income taxes if they were trump  the joke is pretty straightforward  type in your annual income and the calculator shows the same amount of money owed in taxes is exactly    clinton s campaign website also displays a message that reads  donald trump says it s because he s smart  the new york times says it s because he lost almost a billion dollars  either way  donald trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for  years after losing   million in   and trump really did pay zero  or nearly zero  in federal income taxes in         and   until we see evidence otherwise  we ll assume it s still zero  clinton s campaign manager  robby mook just released a statement on the matter  in the statement mook said that  he apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades while tens of millions of working families paid theirs  he calls that  smart  trump has refused to release his tax returns  breaking decades worth of tradition  most people on the left assumed he had something to hide  now we have a bit more of an idea of what exactly he is hiding  since the revelation  trump has been lambasted by many individuals  notably  nevada democratic senator harry reid  who said that trump is a billion dollar loser who won t release his taxes because they ll expose him as a spoiled  rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father   reid also called for the passing of the presidential tax transparency act  the ptta would make it mandatory for presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they seek the office of the presidency featured image from screenshot
