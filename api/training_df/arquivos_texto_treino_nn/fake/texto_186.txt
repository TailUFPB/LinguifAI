milo yiannopoulos will do anything to keep his name in the spotlight after his shameful resignation from his position as senior editor for breitbart news back in february and now the homosexual far right media troll has a new avenue   trying to convince australians to vote against marriage equality  despite marrying an unnamed man in a private ceremony in hawaii just weeks ago australians are currently being asked by their federal government to take part in a postal vote to decide whether the law should be changed to allow same sex couples to marry  as the law in australia was altered in  to define marriage as between a man and a woman  surveys were sent out to australians aged over  years of age and enrolled on the commonwealth electoral role  with results of the mail in only poll scheduled to be announced on november  the vote  coming at a cost of au  million  us  million   has stirred up more than its fair share of controversy  with the nation divided over whether to vote  yes  or  no   surprisingly  yiannopoulos has become a rather loud proponent for australians to vote against same sex marriage  just weeks after his own gay marriage  my gut would be to vote against it  yiannopoulos told the daily mail  adding  i m gay and a catholic  the highest priority for me is making sure no church  no believer anywhere  is required to violate their religious conscience  i think those things can co exist perfectly peacefully  i think the state probably should recognize a gay couple who want to commit to one another   he continued   but the paramount consideration is not those gay couples   it is religious freedoms  another fear that yiannopoulos has is the effect same sex marriage could have on gay culture   one of the few advantages of being gay was that you could tumble out of a nightclub at  on a tuesday and no one could have a go at you for it  but if we re buying into these institutions like marriage  i worry that there will be a deadening effect on gay culture  everyone is entitled to their own opinion  but comments like these are more than just a little ironic when they come directly from the mouth of a man who recently had his own gay marriage  photos surfaced of yiannopoulos  marriage ceremony in hualalai  hawaii late last month  with his spouse named on wikipedia as  john   although little else is known yiannopoulos resigned from breitbart in february of this year amid a cloud of controversy after a video emerged where he stated that the relationship between a man or woman and  year old boys can be  perfectly consensual  and a positive experience for the boys featured image via stephanie keith getty images
