nancy pelosi has been the leader of the house democrats for a very long time  and she is well respected  however  in the wake of the shellacking the democrats took during this election  there were strong rumblings that our party needs new leadership  and rep  tim ryan  d ohio  thought he was the man to unseat pelosi  that turned out not to be the case  though  and pelosi retained her leadership position pelosi will be flanked by powerful house democrats such as rep  jim clyburn  r sc  and rep  steny hoyer  d md  in her efforts to gain seats for the midterms  she was also backed by the powerful congressional black caucus  many may argue that these are the reasons she won with  percent of the vote  but there are things folks do not generally know about the largely unknown rep  tim ryan this anonymity on the part of rep  ryan is important for a number of reasons  while  yes  pelosi is a member of the democratic old guard  she s also much more progressive than tim ryan could ever hope to be  rep  ryan has only been pro choice for a little over a year  and it took a personal situation of his wife having a child that had potential problems to make him recognize the government should not be making those kinds of difficult and deeply personal decisions  it s just like what hypocritical republicans do   they want to control everyone else s decisions in this area  but when it comes to their own lives  they do as they please  it s the ultimate in hypocrisy this is unacceptable  as it really seems to be a matter of political convenience  after all  democrats have been a pro choice party for a very long time  if you re not pro choice  you re not a real democrat  you simply can t be  we re the party that fights for women s rights  we don t need anti woman neanderthals in our ranks also  pelosi is battle tested against the extremism of the house republicans  we know that she will stand up to the bigoted agenda of the likes of paul ryan and his cronies  she won t let them strip away the rights of women  racial minorities  religious minorities  lgbtq people  or anyone else  she also will not allow them to privatize medicare  deregulate the big banks  destroy elizabeth warren s consumer protection bureau  or do any of the other horrific things the gop is salivating over as we speak rep  ryan  you had a good run  but i  for one  am glad that we have nancy pelosi heading things up for the american people in these troubled times featured image via win mcnamee getty images
