scotus returned a split   decision on north carolina s repressive voter id law  which means the lower court s ruling that it s unconstitutional stands  north carolina cannot use that law in november as a basis for turning people away from the polls  and  predictably  governor pat mccrory is unhappy with this  his statement on the matter reads more like a toddler whining about being punished for being bad than anything  north carolina has been denied basic voting rights already granted to more than  other states to protect the integrity of one person  one vote through a common sense voter id law even without any support from our state s attorney general  we were pleased that four justices  including chief justice john roberts  agreed with this right while four liberal justices blocked north carolina protections afforded by our sensible voter laws  b o o h o o  our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for this because mccrory s a delusional twit  whose rights are being violated without this repressive law in effect  this law is what violates people s basic voting rights the lower court held that this particular law was actually a voter suppression law  enacted with the intent to suppress minority votes  why  probably because north carolina is a swing state  so every vote really does matter  and they can t have too many people voting democratic  especially in a presidential year  now can they no  they can t  republicans lose power when too many minorities vote  the horror what mccrory is missing is that  yes   other states have voter id laws of some sort  but several of those states have seen part  or all  of their laws struck down as well  those states include north dakota  home of the attempted six week abortion ban   texas  and wisconsin  other states arizona  kansas  alabama  virginia  ohio and georgia have litigation on their laws pending scotus hasn t ruled on all of these cases  and they may not  depending on what else there is to be heard from other states  to hear mccrory talk  however  one would think that all of the courts in the entire country had ruled specifically against north carolina when other states must have worse laws  these laws don t protect  one person  one vote   though  they protect republicans so what  exactly  did scotus refuse to grant a stay on  north carolina tried to tighten restrictions on acceptable ids  for one  that inevitably harms poor minorities  it can also harm young people  who like to vote democratic more than republican they also reduced early voting  another blow to the minority community  eliminated both same day registration and out of precinct provisional ballots  and they eliminated pre registration for   and  year olds that indicates an intent to vote when they turn  mccrory can cry about this all he wants   this is a major victory for everyone who believes in civil rights  the law will stay off the books for november  helping to keep the state in play for the presidential election  ensuring that many more voices are heard  and hopefully meaning that mccrory will lose his job featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
