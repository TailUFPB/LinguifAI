when hillary clinton called half of trump supporters  deplorables   she said they exhibited  racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamophobic  views and that such views made them irredeemable   at least in the political realm  the only thing that was wrong with her statement is that she left out a key prejudice among trump supporters   anti semitism it s no secret anymore that with the rise of donald trump the united states has seen a rise in anti semitic rhetoric  particularly aimed at those in the media who write unflattering  yet unbiased  articles about trump according to cnn the adl  says it found   million tweets  containing language frequently found in anti semitic speech  between august  and july     of those tweets were directed at american journalists  the adl found  the top  most targeted journalists  all of whom are jewish  received  percent of them the adl says  there is evidence that a considerable number of the anti semitic tweets targeting journalists originate with people identifying themselves as trump supporters   conservatives  or extreme right wing elements  thanks gop  you ve built this  the party that is pro israel is now becoming the party that tells jewish reporters to go  back to the ovens  when they report on trump in a  negative  light journalists such as politico s hadas gold  nyt s jonathan weisman  and julia ioffe have all faced disgusting and deplorable attacks  with trump supporters painting ovens and nazi era  juden  stars and bullet holes on their profiles gold  who was also profiled with a  juden  star  told cnn anti semitism has a long history  but this election has brought about a rise in fear of the  other  and despite being a vital part of american history for hundreds of years  jews are often still seen as the other weisman also spoke to cnn  and noted that it s not just antisemitism that has up ticked this election  but hatred all around i am troubled by the uptick of hate in this country writ large  i would not be so bold as to say that antisemitism on twitter is the worst of it  i would say muslims being beat up in the street  hispanics being ostracized at school   those are far worse  this is just a single manifestation of growing hate and bullying in this country and we all know whose fault that is  while trump has been openly hostile to journalists   referring to them as  absolute scum  and saying that he hates them   he has also dog whistled antisemitism through his conspiracy riddled theories as to why he is losing  when trump says  they  are part of a globalist  banking and media conspiracy against him  it doesn t take a genius to see who  they  pertains to  just look back through history and browse white supremacist websites  whenever  they  are mentioned as holding all the power and influence  it s almost overwhelmingly referring to jews hillary clinton is right  a large chunk of trump supporters are deplorables  they exhibit racism  sexism  homophobia  islamophobia and xenophobia  but now we have another notch to add to their belt  anti semitism featured image via sean rayford getty images
