abigail disney is an heiress with brass ovaries who will profit from the gop tax scam bill but isn t into f cking poor people over  ms  disney penned an op ed for usa today in which she rips the gop a new one because she has  always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality   in other words  she is not donald trump  paul ryan or bob corker  or mitch mcconnell  she is abigail disney  dammit  since the election of ronald reagan  the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up   she writes   but nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by republicans to overhaul the tax system  disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good  and then she dropped a truth bomb   we like truth bombs  republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class  but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed  loss of medicaid and medicare coverage  and less funding for education  all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me  there is even a tax break to private jet owners  this bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over  million people   disney wrote   it will let me pass over   million to my children  tax free  and all my friends with private jets  they get a tax cut too  with a suffocating education system  a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least    trillion bigger  that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you   disney continued   but i will be able to stay comfortably right where i am  does that strike you as fair  no  it does not  thankyouverymuch  but given how this bill was written  i think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from pirates of the caribbean   disney wrote   have i made you angry yet  i really hope i ve made you angry  you should be  no one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind  but you will pay for it  watch this disney heiress is taking a stand against the gop tax bill  even though she s going to benefit from it pic twitter com   nowthis   nowthisnews  december    if democracy is just a bunch of people advocating for their own self interest instead of the interests of the greater good  then we re not a democracy  we re anarchy   disney added   we need to start voting and acting as citizens as though the common good matters more than our own personal well being  this isn t tax reform  it s a heist photo by ralph orlowski getty images for burda media
