republicans in congress used tax dollars to send armed agents to harass a former aide to secretary hillary clinton as part of the never ending fishing expedition into clinton s emails bryan pagliano was a tech aide who helped to set up the server for clinton s emails  and has made top republicans on the house oversight and government reform committee angry because he is asserting his fifth amendment right against self incrimination and refuses to testify it is unclear why they need his testimony  the fbi and department of justice have already determined that clinton s use of the email server does not warrant prosecution but republicans on the committee decided to flex their muscle anyways but when the house oversight and government reform committee subpoenaed pagliano last week  his lawyers said he would again assert his fifth amendment rights  they added that he was willing to meet with the committee in private to make that assertion  but was unwilling to do so under the glare of television cameras in a public event that prompted committee chairman jason chaffetz  r utah  to dispatch the armed marshals with a fresh subpoena last friday  chaffetz revealed in thursday s hearing  to clear up any ambiguity created by mr  pagliano s six lawyers about whether they would confirm service of the prior subpoenas   which they refused to do   we had the u s  marshals personally serve him   chaffetz said the political stunt was slammed by rep  elijah cummings  d md  who said   this served no purpose but to harass and intimidate mr  pagliano  the chairman ordered this action in secret  without even notifying democratic committee members of his plan   no consultation  no debate  no vote  republicans have sought to use their control of congress as a government funded super pac to attack clinton  in addition to her emails  republicans have created multiple committees investigating the attack on u s  personnel in benghazi  all of these committees have cleared clinton and president obama of wrongdoing  but the gop leadership insists on wasting more and more money on these cases and it is all financed by taxpayers featured image via flickr
