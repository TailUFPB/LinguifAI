probably the biggest point of contention with trump s muslim ban was that it was originally written to include everyone  refugees  people on every type of visa we issue  and even green card holders  green card holders are people living and working in the united states legally and permanently  and yet trump tried to tell those who were traveling that they couldn t come back to their country of legal residence because that caused such a massive brouhaha that compounded the rest of the chaos surrounding implementation  white house counsel donald f  mcgahn issued  authoritative guidance  saying that the relevant sections of the order didn t apply to legal permanent residents the administration has also made claims that courts don t have access to the classified information they do  and the  circuit schooled them there  too so here s a rub  the decision states  on pages  and    at this point  however we cannot rely upon the government s contention that the executive order no longer applies to lawful permanent residents  the government has offered no authority establishing that the white house counsel is empowered to issue an amended order superseding the executive order signed by the president and now challenged by the states  and that proposition seems unlikely the white house counsel is not the president  and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the executive departments  the court called trump on the carpet for being unwilling to create  or formally authorize  any exemptions to his muslim ban  they also implied that he was too idiotic to seek his own guidance  and or understand that he signed the order  so nobody can amend it without specific authority so mcgahn can t actually amend the order and trump can t get away with refusing to do real work but that s not all  the court also nailed him on the uncertainty surrounding the order because everyone interprets it differently  moreover  in light of the government s shifting interpretations of the executive order  we cannot say that the current interpretation by white house counsel will persist past the immediate stage of these proceedings  on this record  therefore  we cannot conclude that the government has shown that it is  absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur  so the court is basically saying   we don t trust you  you ve given us zero reason to trust you  and here s another rub  trump   co  think they re the only people with access to the information needed to keep us safe  and they think that nobody outside their circle should get it because what if the bad people hear it  the  circuit s schooling on that said  on page    he government asserts that   nlike the president  courts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations  the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the united states  or gaps in the vetting process   but the government may provide a court with classified information  courts regularly receive classified information under seal and maintain its confidentiality  rules and regulations have long been in place for that  why  because when a court is hearing a case about the legality of a certain policy decision  they need access to all information available  even if it s classified  trump and his minions  though  likely believe that the courts are not to be trusted with classified info  if they truly wanted to make their case  though  once again  they would have consulted someone with expertise to see what they could and should give to the courts when the courts have to teach the lawmakers basic things about the law  we really have to sit back and gawk at the fact that it s a wonder these orders aren t written in entirely in crayon using single syllable words featured image by andrew harrer via getty images
