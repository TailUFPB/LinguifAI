to protect america from terrorist threats that don t even exist  donald trump signed an executive order banning citizens of seven muslim majority countries from entering the united states  since the order was signed  on holocaust memorial day no less  families have been ripped apart and children have been traumatized  one of the saddest of these stories is that of a badly burned baby who is being kept from his family   to protect america  dilbreen  at the age of about a year and a half  was severely burned   explained carrie schuchardt from house of peace in ipswich cbs reports after a heater exploded in the iraqi refugee camp where he was sleeping  an aid group got two travel visas and rushed the boy to shriner s hospital in boston along with his father after preliminary surgery  his dad returned to their war ravaged country to be with his wife as she gave birth to dilbreen s little brother  it was november   an hour before donald trump won the election  they named the baby  trump  it s ironic  possibly humorous  but it s also in a way very meaningful because perhaps that child can redeem that name trump   schuchardt said dilbreen was scheduled to have a second surgery this month and his family had made arrangements to stay at the peace house in ipswich  but trump s muslim ban has brought those plans to a screeching halt  thanks to the bigoted executive order  their visas have been revoked  so they are stranded in iraq   schuchardt said   the child is here  the need for surgery is pressing  on tuesday  massachusetts joined the aclu lawsuit which challenges the legality of trump s order  attorney general maura healey called the muslim ban  harmful  discriminatory and unconstitutional  it threatens the vitality  the livelihood  the lifeblood that drives so much of massachusetts   healey said the lawsuit would help protect immigrants and visa holders already in the united states  but this doesn t mean it would do anything to help this baby waiting for surgery and his family according to cbs  dilbreen is currently staying with family members in michigan and his surgery is still scheduled for feb   attorneys are still fighting for special waivers to allow his family to be with him can somebody please explain to me how separating a burned baby from his parents keeps america safe  how in the hell does this make america great again  this is heartless  cruel and downright shameful watch more on this heartbreaking story here featured image via video screen capture
