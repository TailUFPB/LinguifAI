let s all point and laugh at the sad trump supporters who are just now realizing that they got totally conned donald trump made a lot of promises on the campaign trail but ever since election night he has backed away from many of them or broken them entirely first  trump didn t  drain the swamp   his cabinet is set to be the wealthiest in history and most of his picks are washington insiders and elites that conservatives loathe and many conservatives now realize that trump is going to help republicans wipe out medicare  medicaid  and social security  programs trump repeatedly swore to leave intact trump will also not prosecute hillary clinton and the  big beautiful wall  he promised to build along the mexican border is apparently going to be more like a lame fence instead so  many of trump s supporters are regretting the choice they made on election day and are expressing that regret on social media  and luckily for us  a tumblr site known as trumpgrets is collecting all of their right wing tears for our viewing entertainment and there are plenty more where those came from voting for donald trump is the biggest regret that    americans will have to live with for the rest of their lives  they will be forever known and mocked as the dumbasses who irrevocably damaged this country with their sheer stupidity  but trump voters are far from the only people who should and do have regrets  millions more simply stayed at home or voted for a third party that had no chance of actually winning  and now america is paying the price for it the truly sad thing is that trump hasn t even taken office yet  so we can only imagine how much more people will regret their choice as these next four years drag on featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
