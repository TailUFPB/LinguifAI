for the last ten years  joe scarborough and mika brzezinski have been co hosts on msnbc s morning joe  they have often seemed a little too chummy  and it has long been speculated that the two were an item  however  both were also married to other people  scarborough got divorced from his wife in   and brzezinki was officially free in   to that end  it seems that now that we are in   a respectable enough amount of time has passed to where they can go ahead and confirm the public s belief that they were more than co hosts it is now being reported that the two are not only an item  but are actually engaged to be married  this comes after a bizarre round of  congratulations  on the thursday edition of the show  of course  the duo s guests said the congratulatory sentiments were about  ratings   but now we know that it was about upcoming nuptials  the news comes courtesy of the new york post s emily smith  who writes  we re told scarborough    got down on one knee and proposed at the scenic bar bellini at the hotel du cap eden roc in antibes  which has a breathtaking moonlit outdoor terrace overlooking the mediterranean sea  now  think what you want of mika and joe   i personally have mixed feelings and a bit of a love hate relationship with morning joe   but at least they are finally being honest with the public and their fans  it could be just a bit scandalous  because if they are engaged so soon after mika s divorce  obviously there was an affair happening while either one or both of them were still married of course  these days scandalous affairs are pretty routine for celebrities  though they are supposedly news people   or  at the very least  pundits   so who knows how the network will handle it there have been no public statements on the announcement from joe  mika  or msnbc as of this writing featured image via frederick m  brown getty images
