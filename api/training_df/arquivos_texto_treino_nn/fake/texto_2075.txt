with the  election over  many questions still remain as to its outcome and if it is to be considered legitimate  as of now  the fbi and other intelligence agencies are still looking into russian involvement in our democratic process and how the foreign power may have played a role in influencing the election results one of the ways russia may have influenced the election may have been through bots that spread far right wing media stories throughout social media according to mcclatchy  federal investigators are examining whether far right news sites played any role last year in a russian cyber operation that dramatically widened the reach of news stories   some fictional   that favored donald trump s presidential bid  two people familiar with the inquiry say operatives for russia appear to have strategically timed the computer commands  known as  bots   to blitz social media with links to the pro trump stories at times when the billionaire businessman was on the defensive in his race against democrat hillary clinton  these sources said  further  the bots  end products were largely millions of twitter and facebook posts carrying links to stories on conservative internet sites such as breitbart news and infowars  as well as on the kremlin backed rt news and sputnik news  the sources said  some of the stories were false or mixed fact and fiction  said the sources  who spoke on condition of anonymity because the bot attacks are part of an fbi led investigation into a multifaceted russian operation to influence last year s elections investigators examining the bot attacks are exploring whether the far right news operations took any actions to assist russia s operatives  their participation  however  wasn t necessary for the bots to amplify their news through twitter and facebook  this past election cycle  the far right in particular waged a war of disinformation like one that really hasn t been seen before  it didn t matter if a story wasn t real  if it was anti hillary or pro trump it went out fast and spread like wildfire  not only were the stories mass created  but they were also seemingly consumed by readers at an alarming rate mcclatchy reports  as for the bots  they carried links not only to news stories but also to democratic emails posted on wikileaks  especially those hacked from podesta and made public in october  said philip howard  a professor at the oxford university internet institute who has researched the bot attacks  study of bot generated twitter traffic during last fall s trump clinton campaign debates showed that bot messages favorable to trump significantly outnumbered those sympathetic to clinton  hopefully federal investigators get to the bottom of what is happening on the far right internet to affect the outcome of elections  if there is a connection to russia  not only would that be huge news  but it would confirm long held suspicions by many on the left in regards to the disinformation campaign that s been going on for years by the right russia is clearly trying to insert itself for its own benefit into elections and policy around the globe  it needs to be stopped  and it needs to be stopped now featured photo by marianna massey getty images
