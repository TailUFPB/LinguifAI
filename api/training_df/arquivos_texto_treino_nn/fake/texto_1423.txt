in a day filled with breaking news stories  this one is going almost unnoticed  a new report makes the bombshell  what s not a bombshell today   allegation that michael flynn  who as at the time donald trump s national security advisor  convinced trump to change a tactic in the war on terror because flynn was on turkey s payroll it all started even before trump took office the decision came  days before donald trump had been sworn in as president  in a conversation with president barack obama s national security adviser  susan rice  who had explained the pentagon s plan to retake the islamic state s de facto capital of raqqa with syrian kurdish forces whom the pentagon considered the u s  s most effective military partners  obama s national security team had decided to ask for trump s sign off  since the plan would all but certainly be executed after trump had become president flynn didn t hesitate  according to timelines distributed by members of congress in the weeks since  flynn told rice to hold off  a move that would delay the military operation for months if flynn explained his answer  that s not recorded  and it s not known whether he consulted anyone else on the transition team before rendering his verdict  but his position was consistent with the wishes of turkey  which had long opposed the united states partnering with the kurdish forces   and which was his undeclared client flynn happened to have been paid more than    to represent turkey  after trump fired flynn  he did finally go forward with the raqqa plan this story comes as a near footnote to a breaking story from the new york times that says that the trump administration knew that flynn was under investigation with the fbi before trump even took office  trump still hired flynn and only fired him after it became public knowledge that flynn was vulnerable to blackmail from russia it s no wonder that trump has been pushing so hard to have the investigation into flynn stopped  and it s no wonder he tried to blame president obama s vetting of flynn  obama fired flynn   to paraphrase the famous watergate saying  we are only beginning to find out what trump knew and now  when he knew it  and at best it s sloppy  at worst  we could be dealing with impeachment or treason  the defense of the united states should never be determined by the highest bidder featured image via spencer platt getty images
