throughout the course of donald trump s campaign for the presidency  he s been stoking fears around the nation  his goal seems to be to lead through fear and if he can get enough people to believe the lies that he tells  they ll fall in line behind him to be their leader and protector all of that is absolute poppycock because trump wouldn t know how to protect you from a falling feather  let alone understand what it takes to be leader of the free world now  appearing at trump s running mate mike pence s campaign event on tuesday  a trump supporter brought up trump s myth of  voter fraud   which is that if he loses  it s because hillary cheated  not at all because he s a horrible human being ironically  the only voter fraud currently being perpetrated is by republicans trying to suppress the vote however  this woman in the audience  with fear and horror in her voice  brought up the  voter fraud  trump often talks about  the woman said she s  ready for a revolution because we can t have  in  when pence heard that he stopped the woman in her tracks and said   don t say that   and good on him for doing so  pence then reiterated that the revolution needs to happen is at the voting booth on november   which  in all honesty  is an incredibly accurate and thoughtful response pence seems to understand that democracy isn t claiming the other side won because they cheated  but rather getting out the vote so that your side wins that being said  hillary clinton is about to kick trump s ass this november and it s because more people will want her over a racist a  hole who admits to sexual assault watch the video here  woman   if hillary clinton gets in i m ready for a revolution  b c we can t have her in pence   don t say that  https   t co   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  october    image via video screen capture
