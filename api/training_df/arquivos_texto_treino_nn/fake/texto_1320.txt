to donald trump  his popularity is everything  which may be why his favorite mode of communication is twitter  twitter s model of having people follow other twitter accounts  rather than having a mutual  friendship  gives celebrities and notables opportunities to collect thousands or even millions of followers trump s personal account has about  million followers  which is nothing to sneeze at  then again katy perry has nearly  million and barack obama nearly  million  you have to know that drives trump absolutely crazy trump has been doing some housecleaning recently by blocking some of his more contentious followers  i know several who were blocked just last week   still  his twitter following dramatically increased on tuesday  and there s something very weird about many of those followers  they don t have pictures and they ve never tweeted trump s twitter acc has suddenly gained  mil followers and has been blocking lots of people  new followers look like this  pic twitter com uzykensjuc  john niven     may    niven wasn t cherry picking  if you click on trump s recent followers  more of them have no pictures and no tweets than those who are active twitter users  they re an oddly international  given trump s nationalism  group of followers as well these followers are likely bots  they aren t people at all  according to twitter audit  only  percent of trump s followers are real  nearly half are fake  and that s not just the new ones the number of fake accounts has gotten a lot worse since trump took office this isn t the first time someone has pointed out that a good portion of trump s twitter following is fake  but what s interesting is that its fakeness seems to be increasing  in january  journalist yashar ali ran an audit on trump s twitter account and found that  percent of his then  million followers were real  now he s at  million followers  but only  percent are real  which means of  million followers trump has gained since january  about   million are fake  compare that to barack obama   percent are real in april   when trump was beginning to gain traction as a serious candidate to at least win the republican presidential nomination  the former reality tv star had a mere   million followers  only  percent of which were fake  according to fivethirtyeight  it s not surprising that as trump s global profile has skyrocketed in the past  months  so too have the number of bots attached to his twitter account but it s astonishing how much the percentage of his followers that are fake has risen source  newsweekwhile fake followers are a pretty serious problem on facebook  and not one that the user can always control  it is easy to buy twitter followers and it s a big problem automated adding to lists or collections  you may not add twitter users to lists or add tweets to collections in a bulk or indiscriminate manner  adding a large number of unrelated users to lists is a violation of the twitter rules if trump did pay for the followers  and perhaps even if he didn t   he s violating twitter s rules and his account should be banned featured image via pool getty images
