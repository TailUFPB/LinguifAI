this is why we miss dan rather at the cbs news desk at a time when the media often fails to dig deep and ask the hard hitting questions all for the sake of ratings  at least we still can rely on dan rather to deliver an analysis that makes people think after the debate on sunday night  the legendary newsman delivered a damning criticism of the republican nominee and warned americans of the dire consequences of this election  i am not sure it is possible to truly put into words what we witnessed tonight   rather wrote   this election has long since passed the stage of rationality and reason  the realm of the written page  and into the territory of the heart and spirit  where emotions swirl that we cannot fully distill into coherent sentences and paragraphs  but i will humbly try rather launched into talking about the roman empire and the barbarism that eventually led to its downfall  the debate last night was like watching a fight to the death between gladiators at the colosseum   i had a sense we could  if we are not vigilant  fall into a similar downward spiral   rather noted but rather was pleased with how the moderators did their job  praising anderson cooper and martha raddatz for demanding specifics from both candidates trump  of course  whined about the tough questions and that resulted in a meltdown that lasted throughout the evening as trump preferred personal smears instead of actually giving the american people an idea of what his policies are and how he will enact them  dan rather definitely noticed the differences between the two presidential contenders trump went on the offensive  as advertised  drilling down to an attack on bill clinton  it was a strategy that was all trump  and hillary clinton responded with a volley of all the other insulting statements and lies by trump over the course of the election season  as trump preened  paced and swayed  clinton s steely face spoke volumes  as trump stood  looming over clinton  threatening her with a special prosecutor and even imprisonment  the optics of the gop nominee could be seen as either that of a schoolyard bully or a determined pugilist depending on your point of view  clinton was better answering questions directly and better at laying out what she would like to do as president  trump was more determined to levy personal attacks to put clinton on defensive  especially in the early going clinton engaged mostly with the audience and moderators  donald trump addressed her directly with hand gestures and eye contact  when she spoke  he sometimes stood pacing  or passively  gripping his chair  when he spoke  he often tried to tar his opponent with guilt by association   calling into question clinton s  friends  on taxes in particular and referring to clinton s husband to avoid the glare of his own misconduct  it seems that trump does everything he can to avoid personal culpability or responsibility  he argues that his faults are not so great because clinton and her associates have done much worse   his words are not so dangerous because  locker room  talk has long been excused for men  clinton called for an apology to the many trump has spoken ill of  none was forthcoming  i can t see any of that moving the needle compared to the tsunami that has engulfed the race in the past few days in conclusion  rather talked about the need for all of us to be engaged if we want to end this national nightmare and get back to the business of dealing with our problems with reasonable solutions  we have serious problems facing our nation  and our world   rather wrote our ship of state must be prepared to navigate the perilous shoals of our complicated world   and yet i feel tonight as if we have been hijacked into an alternate universe  this national nightmare will end one way or another and we will awaken to the same world from which we have been so disengaged  that is our challenge and it is a challenge from which none of us can opt out here s the full post via facebook donald trump must be stopped before our country turns into a barbaric nation that is primed to fall like rome did  hate  ignorance  violence  and fear will not make america great again  it will be our end  and that can only be prevented by the american people on november  by making sure trump nevers sees the inside of the white house featured image  larry busacca getty images
