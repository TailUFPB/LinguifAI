as white supremacists whine about donald trump s flip flop on immigration  someone kindly created a video of adolf hitler going batshit crazy about it during an interview with fox news host sean hannity  who has become the republican nominee s chief propagandist  trump backed away from his core promise to round up and deport  million undocumented immigrants of course  all of the racists who support trump s campaign immediately lost their small minds  with some even going so far as to threaten trump if he doesn t keep his original promise ann coulter even threw a fit about it and complained that trump is talking about amnesty  so it looks like coulter and the rest of trump s hardcore supporters have lost a little trust in their candidate  which is hysterical since coulter s new book is titled in trump we trust to mock trump s supporters  rino pundit used the hitler biopic film downfall and changed all of the subtitles to show the nazi leader furiously throwing a temper tantrum over trump s new immigration flap  hannity  coulter  reince priebus  chris christie  and matt drudge are all not spared from hitler s wrath in this hilarious video it begins with one of hitler s advisers telling him that trump could get through a full week without committing a gaffe since coulter is starting her book tour hitler is relieved that trump may finally be in the clear as long as he doesn t pivot on immigration too drastically  then he is told of trump s hannity interview  trump went full blown amnesty on a hannity special   an adviser reluctantly informs the fuhrer then the fun begins as hitler asks everyone who predicted that trump would flip flop to leave the room  all but five leave  hitler then loses his shit and just about every major trump supporter gets mocked here s the video via youtube this is going to make every white supremacist in america throw a hissy fit  so thank you  rino pundit  we salute you featured image via screen capture
