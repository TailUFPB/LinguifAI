the rumors that hillary clinton is sick have been flying around the right as conservatives desperately search for any way possible to take her down and elevate the disaster that is donald trump  even katrina pierson tried to claim that hillary has a  rare brain disease  with no evidence whatsoever  these not so lovely people point to videos of her coughing and appearing to have a seizure  criticize her for getting helped up some stairs  and even claim that her glasses are evidence that she s gravely ill rudy giuliani  who s increasingly extreme and will do anything to remain endeared to donald trump  earned a lot of flak for claiming that hillary clinton is sick  too  without a any evidence other than online videos  the washington post decided to hit giuliani back on that with an op ed titled   is rudy giuliani okay  the first three paragraphs of the op ed are both scathing and sarcastic  and perfect for what giuliani has done  during his  minute speech at the gop convention last month in cleveland  it was notable that when he said donald trump loves  all people  from the top to the bottom   mr  giuliani animatedly gestured toward his knees as he said  top   and above his head as he said  bottom   also  why did he say that he and his wife  judith  have been friends with mr  trump for  years  though he met his wife in   only  years ago also   we re noting this purely out of concern   during his speech he often licked his lips  indicating dry mouth  which  according to the mayo clinic  can be a symptom of nerve damage  stroke or alzheimer s disease  at the end of his address  beads of sweat were visible on his pate   did that not suggest heart disease mr  giuliani is just   but he seemed slightly stooped as he walked to the lectern  where his wide stance made us wonder if he s unsteady on his feet  then there was his slurred diction  as when he referred to  jushtified  police shootings and syrian  refyoongees   more evidence of a stroke  come to think of it  giuliani did look a bit decrepit at the convention  didn t he see how he can t seem to stand up straight   photo by chip somodevilla getty images  and what is up with that squint  did he have a a stroke that affected his vision   photo by john moore getty images we can make ludicrous claims like giuliani  too the post wanted to give giuliani and the rest of the right wing a taste of what it s like for people who aren t doctors of any sort  let alone their doctors  tell the world that they re obviously ill  the truth  however  is that we actually have less cause to question hillary s health than the donald s  because hillary has had a real medical exam and released it trump  however  has not  the record he released was a complete sham  like literally everything else he s done   his doctor is a quack at best  and  like his taxes  he won t release his actual health records  so how are we to know how healthy he really is  despite his quack s assertions that he d be the healthiest president ever of course  the post acknowledges that their assessment of giuliani s health is ridiculous  as they should and as we did above  their goal was to put the entire  ermagherd herllery ers serck  crowd on the right in their place  and they did an outstanding job of it so how does it feel to have someone who is not your doctor  or a doctor of any kind  diagnosing you with health problems based solely on how you appeared on television  mr  giuliani featured image by jeff swensen getty images
