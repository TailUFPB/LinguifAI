former president bill clinton has been known to put hecklers in their place before  and he did it again on tuesday when someone dared to diss obamacare at a florida rally the heckler was seen shouting at clinton for his previous remarks  in which the protester claimed he had called obamacare the  craziest thing in the world   this rubbed clinton the wrong way  and he was noticeably irritated with the accusation as he responded to the accuser  clinton fired back  completely shutting down the claim that he d want to repeal president barack obama s health care law  what are you asking  that is not at all what i said  oh really  go read it  go read it  and don t read it on the internet  don t read it on the internet  get the whole thing  first  i campaigned hard for that law  second  i risked losing the congress to pass universal health care  thirdly  i defended president obama in  and  and he went up  points in the polls after i defended what he did with health care  clinton had far more to say though  and it seemed like the heckler had opened up the floodgates  the former president went on to say that what is really crazy is the republicans who have actively tried to stop reforms in america s health care system  he continued to clarify  we shouldn t be in denial  the president said the same thing  i didn t say a thing that the president hadn t already said  or that the health care people in his administration hadn t already said in his administration  this protester had merely been piggy backing off of the comments that republican nominee donald trump had seized upon  trump tried to twist clinton s words as proof that obamacare was awful and needed to be repealed when he said  president bill clinton came out and told the truth about obamacare  he s absolutely trashed president obama s signature legislation  remember  hillary clinton called obamacare one of the greatest accomplishments of president obama  of the democratic party and of our country  give me a break  clinton has denied that he was criticizing obamacare  and this confrontation with a heckler sets the record straight featured image via steve pope   getty images
