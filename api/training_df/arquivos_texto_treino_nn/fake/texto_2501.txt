given donald trump s disastrous presidential campaign and his even worse first month in the white house  several experts have raised suspicions that trump is mentally ill and must be evaluated immediately  however  for prominent psychiatrist allen francis  m d   there s one major reason we shouldn t be calling trump mentally ill   because he s something far  far worse dr  frances  professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavior sciences at duke university medical center  has just written a damning letter to the editor of the new york times stating that regarding trump as mentally ill is a direct insult to those with mental illnesses  according to dr  frances  who was involved in writing the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders iv  d s m  iv   trump  is bad  not mad  and  crazy only like a fox   frances said that claiming trump has a mental illness is  a stigmatizing insult to the mentally ill  who are mostly well behaved and well meaning  to be lumped with mr  trump  who is neither  unlike those with actual mental illnesses  dr  frances argues that trump causes distress rather than experiencing it  and has been rewarded for his  grandiosity  self absorption and lack of empathy   instead of busying ourselves trying to decide if trump is mentally ill or not  dr  frances believes that  he can  and should  be appropriately denounced for his ignorance  incompetence  impulsivity and pursuit of dictatorial powers  many mental health experts have spoken out about trump before  but this is by far the most critical of them  no one can argue with dr  frances  assessment  everything dr  frances has pointed out about trump s behavior have been things that trump has done very publicly  you can read his full letter in the new york times below  and is just the icing on the cake  dr  frances also wrote a blog post in psychology today in which he urged people to focus on trump s actions instead of his mental state  dr  frances wrote  the urge among amateur diagnosticians to mislabel trump as mentally ill is perfectly understandable  they are terrified  as am i  by his dictatorial and impulsive behavior and feel compelled to resort to psychiatric name calling as a way of delegitimizing him  but this is inaccurate  unnecessary  unfair to the mentally ill  ineffective  and badly off target we must challenge trump on his outrageous behaviors and constant lies  not on his mental status  speculations on trump s psychological motivations  or whether he believes his own lies  are both distracting and irrelevant at this crucial moment  with our fragile democracy at serious risk  i really couldn t care less why trump does what he does  it is his dangerous actions that count  not the psychological reasons he does them  dr  frances also tweeted this on tuesday  i m so tired of amateur analyses of trump s psychology or diagnosis  focus on real danger  his grab of dictator power  dr  frances is dead right  while we may never understand what goes on in trump s mind  the real threat to america is his love of unchecked power   and we shouldn t lose sight of that featured image via mark wilson   getty images
