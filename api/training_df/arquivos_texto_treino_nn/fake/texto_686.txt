special prosecutor robert mueller is growing his team  it appears  the office of special counsel has secured the services of greg andres  a former justice department lawyer specializing in foreign bribery and fraud  he began work on tuesday  becoming the  lawyer on mueller s now all star team  bribery  of course  is a much easier charge to prove than intentional collusion  and having a specialist may indicate mueller is exploring the possibility of taking down trump using whatever methods are available to him and most effective it s easy to lose hope these days  from sunup to sundown  we are treated to some of the worst examples of corruption  greed  and incompetence america has ever known  and it s all coming from an administration we know is illegitimate  and without the kind of leaks that helped derail the clinton campaign   which must have overjoyed trump fans every time they happened   there doesn t seem to be much news on just when we can expect some justice  so don t be too disappointed when i tell you  this is the way it should be that s right  in a proper investigation  the public knows almost nothing about the internal proceedings  and it s with good reason  because james comey flipped on the trump administration  we forget that in the beginning  he was the guy giving traction to unfounded stories about clinton s emails  if that had been a real case  comey himself would have ruined it with his careless premature releases   it would have fallen apart mueller is too smart to be that reckless  by limiting what the public knows other than the occasional tidbit about a new person of interest  an alternative angle at the president s financials  or something new happening within his office  mueller can rest assured that no improper access to evidence can spoil his case believe me  when this all goes down  we want it to go down for good in the meantime  we can enjoy the fact that we now know mueller has andres on the team  by adding more hard hitters to the lineup  we know that mueller is ready to go as long as it takes to eradicate the kind of corruption that brought us the alliance of donald trump and vladimir putin featured image via alex wong getty images
