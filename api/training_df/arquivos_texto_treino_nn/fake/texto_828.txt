donald trump s presidency is spiraling out of control and dear leader appears to be holed up in the white house  avoiding even the people who still support him immediately following his return from the  summit in europe this month  even his daily schedule went completely blank as he retreated behind the walls of  pennsylvania ave  trump has at least added some daily events to his schedule in recent days  but he s not venturing outside it was vice president mike pence   not trump   who left the white house tuesday and spoke publicly and at length about the republicans  health care bill in the wake of its senate collapse  not trump  unlike trump  pence has been maintaining a very public profile in recent days source  share bluein the last month  when trump wasn t leaving the country  pretty much the only reason he left the white house was to go play golf or to watch golf  which he did on june     and   as well as july               and   outside of playing golf or promoting his own business properties  however  trump is clearly in hiding to be fair  trump isn t completely mia  he did a photo op in a firetruck  just like a big boy  on monday and he s spent a lot of time on his golf course  but when it comes to using his legendary  in his own mind  negotiating skills to help save the repeal and replacement of obamacare  one of his top campaign promises   the deal artist offered little to nothing while this is pretty much unprecedented  it signals something major is happening within the white house  since taking office  he s soothed his fragile ego by holding campaign style rallies in front of fawning fans  the last one he held  which was his last state side public appearance  was nearly a month ago  while the fans still exist  trump is even avoiding them  instead  he s presumably seeking comfort in kentucky fried chicken and chocolate cake in front of an increasingly incredulous fox news this isn t particularly surprising  trump has a difficult time in situations that don t offer him adulation  he refuses to make a state visit to the uk until prime minister theresa may can guarantee the nearly universally despised america leader a warm reception featured image via mark wilson getty images
