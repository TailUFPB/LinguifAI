post election  the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history  they are making the claim that trump wasn t elected because of racism  he was elected because of the economy  the problem with that argument  though  is that it s simply not true  trump voters are racist and there s proof the american national elections study  anes  began the study in january  initially  they asked  how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead   now  of course  anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that  it s very unlikely that whites aren t getting jobs because minorities are  but that s not what trump voters think  the vast majority said that it s  extremely likely  that minorities are taking jobs from white people graph courtesy of anes and salon then  they asked the same trump voters about a non racial issue  trade  despite the fact that trade was one of trump s signature issues  their opinions on trade were mixed post election  this is what the study found the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton  eighty four percent of whites who believe it is  extremely likely  that whites can t find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump  compared with  percent of those who think it is  not at all  likely  among white democrats   percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton  compared with less than  percent of those who believe it is not at all likely  eighty one percent of white women who think it is  extremely likely  people of color are taking jobs supported trump  compared with  percent who don t think that more than that   percent of white trump supporters say black people are  violent    percent think that of muslims unfortunately  democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism  hoping that eventually  the aging bigots will die off  it turns out their children are just as bad  sean mcelwee  the man who was responsible for publishing the study  suggested this democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic  racial and gender justice together  a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic  racial and gender inequality  as i ve shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel  racism often diminishes support for progressive policies  the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation great idea  if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots  claims go unchallenged featured image via ralph freso getty images
