a centerpiece of donald trump s campaign  and now his presidency  has been his white supremacist ways  that is why so many of the public feuds he gets into involve people of color  one of his favorite targets  is  of course  the players in the national football league who dare to exercise their first amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racist police brutality  well  there is one person who has figured out that racism is bad for business  even if it did get the orange overlord elected  the founder of the pizza chain papa john s this is a man who has never been on the right side of history on any number of issues  and plus his pizza sucks  but  when he decided to complain about the players protesting  his sales really dropped  turns out racism doesn t pay  and we all know that corporations are all about the bottom line  therefore  papa john schnatter will no longer be ceo of the hack pizza chain breaking  papa john s founder john schnatter to step down as ceo  announcement comes weeks after he criticized nfl over protests   ap business news   apbusiness  december    thing is  while people are certainly allowed to have political opinions  they have to realize that those opinions can often come with dire consequences   especially if one is in the business of trying to garner sales and support from any and all people  which one would presume is the goal of all ceo s  no one knows whether or not the pressure from his shareholders  the public outcry or boycotts  or even the nfl itself had anything to do with his stepping down  as of right now  all we know is that he will be gone  and perhaps the future ceo will run a company that is inclusive of the diverse fabric that we call america  after all  the guiding symbol of this nation will always be the statue of liberty  and bigots like trump and schnatter are the past  the rest of us are the future  we just have to survive the present to get there featured image via rob kim getty images
