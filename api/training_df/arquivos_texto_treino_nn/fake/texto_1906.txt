republicans  pledge to make sure trump s supreme court nominee goes through just hit a little bit of a snag with the disappearance of their filibuster proof majority on tuesday  cbs reported that democrats managed to gather the necessary  votes to ruin donald trump and his cohorts  week the crucial  vote came from democratic sen  chris coons of delaware who announced his decision monday as the senate judiciary committee met to vote on gorsuch s nomination coons said that he had decided to oppose president donald trump s nominee over concerns that include his vague answers in his hearing coons  opposition will prevent republicans from reaching the  votes they need to move gorsuch over procedural hurdles to a final senate vote unfortunately  this doesn t mean that we won t see gorsuch sitting on the supreme court  republicans are likely to change the senate rules to allow gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority of  votes rather than the current  votes needed so far  two democrats have betrayed americans by siding with republicans   west virginia s joe manchin and north dakota s heidi heitkamp   in supporting gorsuch s nomination things are looking grim for those of us who don t want someone who have proved himself to be the enemy of women and disabled children on the supreme court  keep fighting  keep making phone calls we must not allow donald trump to destroy the supreme court featured image via getty images  pool
