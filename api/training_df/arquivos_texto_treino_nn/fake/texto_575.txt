this is proof that donald trump has only emboldened white nationalists in the aftermath of the attack that killed a counter protester in charlottesville  virginia  trump reacted by refusing to directly condemn white nationalists  instead blaming both sides as if the woman who died got herself murdered by domestic terrorists  we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred  bigotry and violence on many sides   on many sides   trump said clearly  trump was unwilling to anger his most ardent supporters  and they praised him for it neo nazi publication the daily stormer was very pleased with trump s remarks  especially the part where he basically gave them permission to keep terrorizing the nation  he didn t attack us   wrote site founder andrew anglin  according to the huffington post  he just said the nation should come together  nothing specific against us  he said that we need to study why people are so angry  and implied that there was hate   on both sides  so he implied the antifa  are haters  there was virtually no counter signaling of us at all  he said he loves us all  also refused to answer a question about white nationalists supporting him  no condemnation at all  when asked to condemn  he just walked out of the room  really  really good  god bless him  in short  white nationalists believe that trump s non condemnation means that he stands with them and that s a serious threat to the safety of every citizen in this nation white nationalists now believe they can do whatever they want and that they have trump s approval this is why donald trump must condemn white nationalists  but even if he did so now  it s too little  too late the vile racists and nazis who comprise the alt right movement will simply ignore it and insist that trump s true feelings about their group were already stated in his initial reaction so  trump may have just made the most dangerous blunder of his presidency  he just gave white nationalists a green light to continue spewing hate and being violent in their push to make america racist again that was made even more clear by kkk grand wizard david duke  we are determined to take our country back   duke said   we are going to fulfill the promises of donald trump  that s what we believed in  that s why we voted for donald trump  because he said he s going to take our country back  that s what we gotta do  it s time for this generation of americans to renew the fight against nazis and white nationalists  american troops did not sacrifice their lives fighting in europe during world war ii so that nazis could take power in our own country  they would be horrified by trump s coddling of this hateful anti american movement and they would be ashamed that the american people aren t doing more to put an end to it once and for all featured image  andrea morales getty images
