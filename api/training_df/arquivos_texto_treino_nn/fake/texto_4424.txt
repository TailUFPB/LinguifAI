dubbed the  missing white voters   nate silver s fivethirtyeight wrote an in depth analysis of what donald trump needs to do in order to win  register between  to  million white voters starting now until election day here s a scary stat for democrats  in   president obama won re election by almost  million votes  but about  million eligible white voters without a college degree   including  million men   didn t bother to vote  in   these nonvoters are part of the demographic that is most strongly in favor of donald trump if trump rouses even a fraction of these notoriously disaffected americans   like this grease smudged   year old first time voter in western pennsylvania   he could surge to victory  there s just one catch  if we re on the cusp of a blue collar great awakening  it s not yet showing up in the registration data in other words  trump has all this support from this major demographic that could deliver him to a landslide victory   but they aren t registered  these  missing  white voters are literally the key to donald trump s success  and they hold the key to the swing state vote if trump were able to activate merely one of every eight of these  missing whites  to vote for him  he would wipe out obama s  margins in three states   florida  ohio and pennsylvania   and win both the electoral college and the popular vote  if he were able to activate one of every five  he could add virginia  nevada  iowa and new hampshire so  in order to merely  catch up  to president obama  trump needs to register at least  million more people  considering registration among nonwhite voters  who overwhelmingly favor hillary clinton  is up in battleground states like pennsylvania and north carolina  compared to white registrants   and clinton is gaining with white women  trump has even more to go if trump hopes to overtake obama s numbers in the crucial swing states  he better hurry up the voting registration deadlines in florida  pennsylvania and ohio are on october   less than two weeks away  in less than three weeks  virginia and nevada will reach their deadlines  october  here are the dates of individual state deadlines in other words  the trump campaign has  days to register at least  million white voters in  swing states  which translates to   voters a day considering his horrendous excuse for a ground game  that won t be an easy feat as of right now  democrats have the upper hand in pennsylvania and virginia  where metropolitan  non white registrants are trouncing rural whites fivethirtyeight finds that trump s shoddy ground game  mixed with laziness enabled by the rnc  hurt his chances greatly so what s going on  it could be that trump is motivating slightly more new voters against him than for him  or  perhaps more likely  it could be that white working class voters are out there to be activated  but trump s campaign and the republican national committee have waited until too late to build the analytics and ground infrastructure necessary to identify and register them  that s where clinton and the democrats have excelled so with less than three weeks to go until more than half the states end the registration process  the trump campaign has already hit a wall  no pun intended   democrats shouldn t get too excited  the chances that a massive voter turnout on election day could propel trump to the presidency is a possibility  democrats need to keep up their registration efforts  and launch a get out the vote movement of equal or better proportions featured image via spencer platt getty images
