you might never suspect that up here in beautiful washington state  we have one of the largest numbers of white supremacist groups in america  after all  it s gorgeous and relatively quiet  and this is a  blue  state  right  but under all of our fall colors  our lakes  our bike lanes  and our farmer s markets is the same hate you see in the deep south or the rural midwest or really anywhere in the united states in fact  here in the northwest part of the northwest  there are a surprising number of  alt right  adherents  but considering how rural much of the area between seattle and canada is  nobody should be surprised at how many trump supporters there are  and that seems to have been the catalyst for many people in my neck of the woods who at one time were relatively self policing  permission from the president to be bigots  if you listen to donald trump when the conversation moves to white nationalism  the subtext is almost that bigotry makes you more american  and we have got some flag wavers in these parts so last month when my local paper covered a local murder that was  at least peripherally  connected to the alt right  it really wasn t shocking to me  my  now adult  son and i have attended any number of rallies up and down the freeway corridor we live on  and there is a strong presence of richard spencer wannabes and milo yiannopoulos sycophants at every single one  but over the fold was a face i knew  lane davis  a  year old guy who lived a few doors down from my mom s old house  i saw him in stores and on the street  i bummed him a smoke outside the safeway more than once i touched that guy s hand image via facebookhe killed his dad out on samish island  an island that s only actually an island because of a river that crosses the farmland you have have to drive through to get out there  you don t think about white supremacists on your way to samish island  i didn t anyway  i thought about my niece s wedding and my grandpa s funeral  both held at the samish island community center  i think about the herons and red tailed hawks that hang out in those fields  i think about my mom sometimes  she s a trump supporter and a bigot  but she wouldn t stab anyone like lane davis did davis worked for milo for a little while  and he went by the online name     under which he posted to reddit  his youtube channel  and later  a super mega extremely far right website   the ralph retort   which i just won t link  so get to googling if that s your thing   and really  the link at the beginning of the last paragraph has a pretty in depth profile of his various exploits  after the daily beast got their hands on the  call his mother made that fateful day but it s incomplete  this is a small place  and it s personal  the judge who signed off on davis  probable cause affidavit was the same man who gave me custody of my son  my friends are friends with lane davis  friends  i guarantee without texting her to ask her that the saleswoman who used to sell furniture for me knew lane davis personally and had possibly been to his house  when i tell you about the little place i live in  and how i casually handed out smokes to an eventual murderer  and the geography and wildlife near where that murderer lived  what i want you to do is go back to the words in bold letters a few paragraphs ago before donald trump  the white nationalists  racists  skinheads  klan members  and just generally hateful people around here might have said something racist in public once  maybe they had  no trespassing  signs all over their deep woods properties  miles up the skagit river  maybe they sported  iii   or  prius repellent  stickers on their giant trucks with the smokestacks tuned to blast creosote every time they leave a stoplight now they kill their dad because he called them a nazi and tried to kick them out of the house when he got sick of their bullshit heck  lane davis isn t even the first murderer i ve ever known  i used to play d d when i was a kid with a dude who killed another guy after a party back in the early  s  but that guy  by the time we were teens  we knew he was going to end up in prison  he was disturbed  he was morbid  he was violent lane davis was just a racist until donald trump came along featured image via screen capture
