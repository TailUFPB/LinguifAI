with president elect donald trump s inauguration just days away  it seems like he s still trying to clean up his most recent messes and scandals one of the most recent bombshells to shake up trump s deeply flawed transition was the public release of an unverified report that trump had paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed president barack obama had previously slept in while visiting a hotel in russia  in an interview with fox news s ainsley earhardt  it seems like trump is still trying to convince america that he didn t do it   and his excuses continue to get more pathetic  trump said  it s fake news  it s all fake news  you know  i can say something about george washington  i can say something about abraham lincoln  i can say something about you  i can just   fake news and  shouldn t have been a part of it  clearly nervous about the fact that penthousehas recently offered a   million prize to anyone who could produce the tapes of the scandal  trump s insecurity and panic came right through as he went into a weird denial infused rant  trump said  it s made up  never existed  never happened  and the reason i say that so strongly because nothing is ever going to show up  there s never going to be a tape that shows up  there s never going to be anything that shows up  now  i would be very embarrassed if a tape actually showed up  saying something like that  it would be double embarrassed because i m saying there is no tape  there is no event  i was never even in that room for that period of time  then  trump ripped everyone from the gop to the democratic party to the media  it started with the republican party when they tried to beat me in the nomination and it went on  the democrats took over the work  supposedly  and by the intelligence giving it credence by just even talking about it   it was very inappropriate  so i don t know who the leaker was  i have no idea  but it s fake news  you can watch trump miserably fail at doing damage control below featured image is a screenshot
