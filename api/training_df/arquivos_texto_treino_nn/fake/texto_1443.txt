comedian dave chappelle  known for his razor sharp and hilarious views on race in america  is officially apologizing for asking america to give trump a chance chappelle asked people to give trump some time to settle into his role as president before judging him last year  during a monologue on saturday night live that aired a few days after the election  but in a set the comedian performed at caroline s in new york  he told the audience that he regrets what he said chappelle got right to the point with his apology  saying  i was the first guy on tv to say  give trump a chance   i fucked up  sorry   that time when dave chappelle apologized for asking us to give trump a chance  the self proclaimed  jane goodall  of white people now has this to say about trump s instability  the muslim ban  and what a black presidency was expected to look like      davechappelle  nyc  robinhoodnyca post shared by caroline nyc   carolinenewyork  on may    at   pdthe went on to deliver a strong set that touched on exactly why he was wrong  chappelle said   every day you wake up and you never know what  is going to do next  the comedian also touched on trump s racism and islamophobia  bringing up the president s failed muslim ban   donald trump said we shouldn t let any muslims into the united states  until we can figure out what s going on   and i think that s way out of step with the way people feel in america  at the time  his snl monologue got some pushback from media critics who argued that giving trump a chance to be presidential  after spending most of his campaign behaving badly  was misguided chappelle couched his call for tolerance with a plea for trump to return the favor  saying at the time   i m wishing donald trump luck  and i m going to give him a chance  and we  the historically disenfranchised  demand that he give us one too  but clearly chappelle doesn t feel like trump has held up his end of the bargain  and it s hard to disagree with that sentiment
