this maniac wants  the handmaid s tale  to become reality abortion is protected by the constitution in this country  but a wisconsin lawmaker thinks that women should be forced to get pregnant and give birth wisconsin state gop rep  scott allen made the horrendous remarks while criticizing a bill that would block state employees from covering abortion with their health insurance because he doesn t think the bill goes far enough seriously allen pitched his idea to force women to give birth  and tried to justify his idea by claiming that forcing women to give birth will somehow help the economy  labor force shortages are tied to population declines  labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth  limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure  in spite of this mr  speaker  ironically  the democrats continue their efforts to support the abortion industry  see what he did there  allen claims that forcing women to give birth against their will is good for the economy  i m sure he would say the same thing about slavery  too here s the video via twitter your  saturdaymorning wtf wi rep  scott allen says women should be made to give birth for the good of the economy  pic twitter com   holly o reilly   aynrandpaulryan  november    is  of course  wrong  the fact is that there are millions of americans who are currently unemployed  there are more people in this country than there are jobs  more people will not solve the economic problems we face today  and if women are forced to have babies  it will only make the problem worse  especially among teens  teen girls who get pregnant and have babies are at an economic disadvantage  many are forced to drop out of school and forgo college  making it more difficult for them to get high paying jobs the lack of child care services in this country also makes it difficult for women to work and take care of their children at the same time the cost of raising children is incredibly expensive now  and most people are struggling to get by as it is  more kids will just add more struggle and stress  this country has a sufficient labor force  the problem is that businesses would rather hire what amounts to slave laborers overseas  wages are also too low  which prevents most people from sparking economic growth through spending  if all workers can do with the little money they get is pay bills  it leaves very little left to spend at area businesses in the end  forcing women to have kids is unconstitutional and will do nothing to grow the economy  forcing big business to pay worker a livable wage  however  will turn the economy into the powerhouse it once was featured image  screenshot
