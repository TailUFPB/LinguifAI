tuesday morning  attendees of a senate subcommittee hearing were treated to that wonder of wonders  a  hot mic  episode   in which a speaker continues talking without realizing that their microphone is still live  in this case  it was republican senator susan collins of maine collins  noted recently for her opposition to the gop health care bill currently before the senate  is known for thinking outside her party  it s not really surprising that she does   it s actually surprising that more republican female members of congress aren t at least a little concerned with their colleagues  behavior  but if collins  bucking the party on trumpcare made you smile  the exchange she had with the ranking democrat on the subcommittee she chairs  jack reed of rhode island  will make you smile even bigger collins  i swear   just went through and whenever there was  grant   they just x it out  with no measurement  no thinking about it  no metrics  no nothing  it s just incredibly irresponsible reed  yes  i think   i think he s crazy  i mean  i don t say that lightly and as a kind of a goofy guy collins  i m worried reed  oof  you know  this thing   if we don t get a budget deal  we re going to be paralyzed collins  i know reed   is going to be paralyzed  everybody is going to be paralyzed collins i don t think he knows there is a  or anything reed  he was down at the ford commissioning saying   i want them to pass my budget   okay  so we give him   billion and then we take it away across the board which would cause chaos collins  right reed  it s just   and he hasn t   not one word about the budget  not one word about the debt ceiling collins  good point reed  you ve got  mulvaney saying we re going to put in all sorts of stuff like a border wall  then you ve got  mnuchin saying it s got to be clean  we re going to be back in september  and  you know  you re going to have crazy people in the house then the conversation got funny  on monday  a texas congressman was clearly referring to collins when he blamed  female senators from the northeast  for holding up trumpcare  he said if she were a  guy from south texas   he might take her on   aaron burr style  collins  did you see the one who challenged me to a duel reed  i know  trust me  do you know why he challenged you to a duel   cause you could beat the shit out of him collins  well  he s huge  and he   i don t mean to be unkind  but he s so unattractive it s unbelievable collins  did you see the picture of him in his pajamas next to this playboy bunny unfortunately  i must now show you the picture she s talking about this is the photo sen  susan collins was referring to when she commented on rep  blake farenthold wearing pajamas in   pic twitter com   beatrice elizabeth   missbeae  july    obviously that last bit caught someone s ear  because the mic was cut off seriously  though  it is adorable that  even in what she thought was a private conversation  and even though that slob had talked about literally shooting her  she still says  i don t mean to be unkind  the only thing left to make collins a democrat at this point is to say this stuff into a mic she knows is live featured image via alex wong getty images
