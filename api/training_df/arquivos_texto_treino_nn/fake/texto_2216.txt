republicans nationwide seem to want to get rid of regulations on just about everything   guns  corporations  environmental protections  etc   but when it comes to women  they can t regulate fast enough there is currently a state bill in texas that just passed through the senate committee on state affairs unanimously     that will allow doctors to lie to women about anything wrong with their baby  not only that  it prevents parents from being allowed to sue according to the dallas voice     which would allow doctors to withhold information from pregnant women about the status of their fetus and then  if the child were born with a deformity or disability  prevent the parents from suing the doctor for withholding the information   has passed out of the senate committee on state affairs on an   vote and is headed to the full senate  the man behind sb   state sen  brandon creighton  r  conroe  senate texas govcreighton is described  as a genuine defender of conservative values  he has relentlessly hammered excessive taxation  pursued  loser pays  tort reform  passed drug testing for unemployment benefits  stood up for texas   amendment rights and effectively blocked obamacare s medicaid expansion   so  really  he s an a  hole on pretty much every level  he hates the poor  hates women  and hates people being able to sue companies when something happens to them because of a product or service when it comes to sb   he says  senate bill  will send a message that texas does not believe that a life  in and of itself  is an injury in which parents need a damage payment  he thinks doctors should be able to keep pertinent information about a baby in the womb from the parents and that doctor should be protected for doing so  that s messed up on so many levels  it isn t pro life  it s pro birth and anti freedom  and seems pretty damn immoral  it s a bill to prevent abortion by holding back information  the fact that it s already passed the senate committee   is even more mortifying according to the dallas voice  blake rocap  legislative director for naral pro choice texas  said   we shouldn t have to stand up and say that it shouldn t be policy for the state of texas to excuse doctors from lying to their patients  and that is what this bill does  one would think that should be obvious  but republicans are getting more outrageous and bold in their hatred of women by the day  shame on them featured photo by joe raedle getty images
