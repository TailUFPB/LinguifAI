one would think that conservatives would have figured out by now that they can t get people to turn out for their marches and protests  that seems to be especially true with trump in office  so many more people are against him than for him  yet these delusional trumpkins still think they re some kind of majority in this country witness their enthusiasm for today s march  trump  it was supposed to be a counter to the women s march on washington that happened all over the world the day after trump s inauguration  the women s march drew well more than two million people just in the u s  the march  trump must have been overwhelming then  given all that support trump and his loyal subjects think they have and overwhelming these marches were  in their own way   the lack of support they showed for trump is actually what was overwhelming  most of these protests drew dozens  rather than the thousands they seemed to think they were going to get  for instance  in orlando  roughly  people showed up  compared to the   that showed up in january for the women s march denver had just dozens  where   had marched in january  in our nation s capital  trumpers were hoping that they could draw more than half a million  which would rival the women s march there  they drew a few thousand at best  despite trump s claim that marches for him would be the biggest marches of all here at the yuge rally for trump at the white house pic twitter com   brian tashman   briantashman  march     trumptrain is in town and standing strong for  potus i will be articulating the case for  trump shortly  friends   pic twitter com   michael johns   michaeljohns  march    s the march at trump tower in new york city literally the march  trump pic twitter com   eric grant   ericgrant  march    crowd at the march  trump  pic twitter com   eric grant   ericgrant  march    were just as pathetic elsewhere  too   draws about  people to voinovich park  plus about  counter protestors pic twitter com   kabir bhatia   kabirbhatiatime  march     march in columbus  oh   blacklivesmatter  nobanbowall  organizecbus  jaronthomas    soitgoes  marymad  ohiopjp pic twitter com   surj columbus   surjcolumbusoh  march      rally in springfield il pic twitter com   james b   jebladat  march    are live from denver where black bloc is confronting march  trump dpd ready with police tape line https   t co  pic twitter com   unicorn riot   urninja  march    better view of just how empty the plaza is for this pro trump rally  sad  pic twitter com   cari wade gervin   carigervin  march    is embarrassing for them  trump supporters keep trying to tell the resistance to  get over it   and  give up   and ultimately call us treasonous for daring to oppose a dangerous orange despot in the white house  if they truly had the love and support they think  their protests would blow anti trump protests out of the water every time  doesn t look like we re the ones who need to get over anything featured image via screen capture
