mitch mcconnell pretended to care about the american people on tuesday as he blamed democrats for his own party s failure to pass trumpcare seriously  he actually had the gall to accuse democrats of not caring about people even though the  repeal and replace  bill his party tried to pass would have stripped healthcare away from millions of americans and would have gutted medicaid all while erasing the protections provided by the affordable care act  he even made the outrageous claim that republicans reached out to democrats to work with them on the bill  i imagine many democrats were celebrating last night   mcconnell said during a speech on the senate floor   i hope they consider what they re celebrating  the american people are hurting  they need relief  and it s regretful that our democratic colleagues decided early on that they did not want to engage with us seriously in the process to deliver that relief  these are not just numbers on a page these are real people   he continued except that republicans never asked democrats to work with them  republicans wrote the destructive bill all by themselves and they demanded that democrats vote blindly in favor of it as we all know  democrats told republicans to go f ck themselves  and even some republicans refused to support the bill because it was that bad  many republicans faced massive opposition from their own constituents at town halls over the bill and if republicans really cared about  real people   they would have drafted a bill that doesn t kick over  million real people off of their health insurance  it s that simple but mcconnell wants to blame democrats and pretend that his party cares about people  that doesn t jive considering that republicans tried killing obamacare mostly because they wanted to give a fat tax gift to the wealthy at the expense of  real people  who would not be able to afford healthcare without obamacare  i regret that the effort to immediately repeal and replace obamacare will not be successful   mcconnell said   that doesn t mean we should give up  we will now try a different way to bring the american people relief from obamacare  that plan is not exactly  different  either  it s a  gop plan that would make premiums skyrocket and strip healthcare from even more americans here s the video via youtube twitter users were quick to take mcconnell to the woodshed i just listened to you blaming  democrats for this   liar  you drafted your bill behind closed doors   excluded dems  this is on  senategop   thenextphoenix   thenextphoenix  july     bitch   matt bush   itsmattbush  july    do you have against the average  normal  wage earning american  why must you do everything in your power to weaken and hurt us   jay hova     july    twitter com   crutnacker   crutnacker  july    repeal and do nothing   what cowardice  walter pepper     july    you need to get your eyes checked because you re not seeing all the americans at their senators offices protesting a repeal   american woman   valentineomine  july    healthcare bill has failed  senatemajldr  trumprussia pic twitter com grgnaljdgx  bhaktin   bhaktinjai  july    image  screenshot
