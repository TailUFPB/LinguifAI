almost immediately following the nov   election  trump and his fledgling administration made a point of denying that they were in contact with russia about anything  now his own national security adviser  michael flynn  is saying otherwise  flynn has more or less said that he might have discussed the sanctions privately with russia s ambassador to the u s   sergey kislyak  but there are nine officials who all say he definitely did flynn first denied the allegations rather emphatically  according to a report from the washington post  however  he walked it back through his spokesman later on  who said that he  indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions  he couldn t be certain that the topic never came up  that s an interesting way of not answering a question  but it might get him off the hook just a little  the post reports that no fewer than nine officials  who have access to reports from law enforcement and intelligence agencies that monitor communications of russian diplomats  say that flynn s references to the sanctions obama imposed following the election were explicit and clear  two also said that flynn actually told russia not to overreact to the penalties since all of this could be discussed again after trump was sworn in a third official said that either flynn had lied to mike pence  who flatly denied the allegations  too  or that pence misspoke  knowing this administration  it s the former  pence told cbs   face the nation  the following  i talked to general flynn about that conversation and actually was initiated on christmas day he had sent a text to the russian ambassador to express not only christmas wishes but sympathy for the loss of life in the airplane crash that took place  it was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation  they did not discuss anything having to do with the united states  decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against russia  after host john dickerson pressed him on whether flynn had ever had a conversation about sanctions with kislyak at any time  pence said  well  look  general flynn has been in touch with diplomatic leaders  security leaders in some  countries  that s exactly what the incoming national security advisor should do  but what i can confirm  having spoken to him about it  is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the united states took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions  he then finished that part of the interview with   i don t believe there were more conversations  u s  intelligence agencies became suspicious after putin s lackluster response to our kicking out all of their diplomats  and they began to look for evidence suggesting that he was promised relief  they discovered that conversations between flynn and kislyak had happened around the time we announced the new sanctions and kicked their diplomats out the administration s position was to deny  deny  deny  because of course  but flynn isn t exactly denying it anymore  this may have something to do with congress seeking to limit trump s ability to ease the sanctions  it may have anything to do with anything   maybe he just feels backed into a corner now the point is  of all the lies coming out of this administration  this is one of the biggest and the worst thus far  oddly enough  both flynn and his son seem to have deleted their twitter accounts  that could be for any reason  but it s just a little too coincidental to the post s report now we get to wonder what else this administration has done to aid an official enemy  working to rebuild relationships and strengthen ties is one thing  working to aid an enemy is another  and that s what flynn  and by extension  trump  has done featured image by drew angerer via getty images
