during his presidential campaign  donald trump constantly made references to repealing and replacing  the disaster that is obamacare  and democrats collectively shuddered  we all knew that nothing good could come of this now after six months in office  despite discovering that nobody knew healthcare could be so difficult  president trump is about to deliver on his campaign promise as the senate returns from a one week recess to get back to the task at hand  trying to come to an agreement on their new healthcare bill known as the better care reconciliation act  bcra   one that they have predominately kept the public in the dark about things are looking bleak  however  as even the republican party remains divided on a bill that is not only going to raise out of pocket costs and restrict access to services for many  but also cause tens of millions to lose their health insurance completely over the coming decade these charts might be able to put the entire healthcare debacle into perspective   we all know the short term medicaid cuts are going to suck  the new health care bill will save a ton of money  but roughly a quarter of those savings  or approximately   billion over the next decade  come from cuts to medicaid  the result is that  million less people will be enrolled in medicaid under the new gop bill than compared to obamacare   if you thought that was bad  the long term effects are even worse  the inflation rate for medicaid spending beginning in  is much slower  affecting those who rely on it the most  mainly children  the disabled  and the elderly  in fact  by  federal medicaid spending on children will be reduced by almost a third and by a quarter for the disabled and the elderly when compared to the current law according to an analysis by the health consulting firm avalere health   the percentage of those uninsured will rise in every single age bracket  that s right  under the bcra  million people will lose their insurance  compared to  million under the version passed by the house  and every single age group will be affected  according to an assessment by the congressional budget office   it will also rise in every state  including those whose overwhelming majority voted for trump  yes  the new bill will drive up the uninsured rate by at least   and even up to   in every state by   a new study by the urban institute found   the older and poorer you are  the more you will be paying for insurance premiums if an analysis by the center for budget and policy priorities is to be believed  health insurance premiums are going to go through the roof  but those hit the worst will be older americans   the older middle class will be hit pretty hard too  as their tax credits will go through the floor  the center for budget and policy priorities  analysis also found that the tax credits that are available to help older people in the individual market afford health insurance are going to do just the opposite and plummet   even employer plans aren t immune  the gop s new bill cuts to medicaid and individual market subsidies have given the  million americans that receive their health insurance through their employer a false sense of security  but they re not safe  either  not only will the new legislation bring back annual and lifetime limits in employer plans  as well as end penalties for companies that don t provide health insurance to their workers  but it will also allow employers to shift much of the cost of copays  deductibles and coinsurance onto their workers  the center for american progress calculated how many will feel the crunch   hospitals are going to feel the crunch as well  hospitals aren t happy with the new bill and it is easy to see why  when you consider it will cause a large spike in uncompensated care for hospitals across all states    finally  the new bill will cause massive job loss  particularly in the health care sector  by   more than   million jobs will be lost as a direct result of the bcra go by the results of a report by the commonwealth fund and george washington university  in fact  the report goes as far as to say that every state except hawaii would have fewer jobs and a weaker economy   however  it s not just health care employment that will be affected  but also retail and construction as well so if you thought this latest rewrite of the gop s health care legislation didn t affect you  you more than likely thought wrongly  even if it isn t your health care that is directly affected  chances are you will still feel the ripple effects of the bill on the economy  both on a state and national level featured image via drew angerer getty images
