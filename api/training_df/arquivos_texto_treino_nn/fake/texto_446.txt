donald trump has now become well known for his completely inappropriate tendency to disrespect those who should be honored  we ve seen it numerous times in trump s efforts to congratulate and honor members of the military  and we witnessed it again earlier today on saturday  trump visited houston  texas to assist a hurricane harvey relief effort  while he was there  trump attacked the media several times   but the most notable one was the incident that happened at the expense of the coast guard in speaking with military officials and first responders who were responsible for saving lives in texas  trump couldn t help himself from going after the free press  trump congratulated the coast guard  right before uttering this disgusting attack while pointing directly at the cameras  i hear the coast guard saved almost   people by going into winds the media would not go into  they will not go into those winds unless it s a really good story  in which case they will  for someone who wants the media to be nicer to him and protect his fragile ego  trump sure doesn t know how to behave himself  the hilarious thing about what trump just said is that several members of the media did far more to help harvey victims than trump did  if he would turn off fox news for a second and actually pay attention to real news  he would have known that several media figures were helping the coast guard and other first responders in their relief efforts  there have even been several documented instances in which reporters directly assisted harvey victims while they were working  but of course  we can t expect trump to take the high road   ever  you can watch trump disrespect the coast guard and the free press below pres  trump praises coast guard for saving people  by going into winds that the media would not go into unless it s a really good story   pic twitter com   abc news politics   abcpolitics  september    image via win mcnamee getty images
