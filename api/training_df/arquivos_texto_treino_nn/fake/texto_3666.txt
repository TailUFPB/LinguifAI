conservatives have set up a fascist  professor watchlist  website in order to target professors they feel aren t conservative enough  as professors are teachers  and reality has a liberal bias  it s likely to get pretty extensive the project  by turning point usa  was set up by  year old conservative wonderboy charlie kirk  a young man who is clearly frustrated by the lack of reception among his peers for his fascist and anti american ideals  the  about us  section on their website reads   the mission of professor watchlist is to expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom  help us identify  and expose more professors who have demonstrated liberal bias in the classroom  donate today  it s interesting that a group whose favorite slogan is  big government sucks   doesn t understand how supporting the new administration s war on speech is the most intrusive government ever gets  it s important to remember that when a republican says something bad about  big government   they almost always want to replace it with a rich guy or corporation making the same decisions for you  they don t care about the public good  only private profit it s notable that  as a  c   the purpose of the group should be religious  educational  literary  charitable  or scientific in nature  there are a couple of other qualifications as well  but the important thing to take away here is that an organization concentrated on smearing individuals for speech they believe is political in nature probably doesn t qualify  and any good citizen should file a complaint with the irs  they re abusing the tax code to avoid revealing donors  if they endorse a candidate or could be construed as campaigning  their tax exempt status will go out the window  this is only a step away  the rest of turning point s activities are not any more charitable or less political politics isn t enough for republicans  they can t win the vote or argue policy   they have to gerrymander districts and cheat to win  they can t keep religion in the churches   they need everyone to believe the same way they do  they can t stomach free speech   they have to make war on the press  try to silence opposition  and shut down debate on college campuses bbc reports nearly  professors are listed on the website  the list is searchable by school or name and includes pictures of the university teachers and descriptions of their alleged transgressions  backed up by links to conservative news sites  almost all the instances on the website are people who not only oppose what we believe in but are very biased against it and don t present the other side   says matt lamb  director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at turning point  we just want students  parents  alumni to know what s going on  so if an alumni is thinking of donating to a school they may want to know where their money is going  if they believe or agree or disagree with the professor s views  so far  it looks like students and professors are fighting back  names like jesus and indiana jones have been added  with appropriate descriptions of their liberal propaganda and agenda  and the hashtag  trollprofwatchlist trended a few days ago with people posting their troll submissions to the website  the more that are added  the more confusing and difficult the job of identifying disagreeing professors will be for the fascists however  while silliness and trolling may temporarily undermine the usefulness of the site  the underlying danger presented cannot be ignored or denied  this is an age where republicans have their own media  their own version of the world  and in many ways  their own truth  objectivity be damned    this is an age where  fake news  lists are passed around based on a partisan slant  those of us on the left generally understand when something is fact or opinion   the other side  not so much   this is an age where lists of professors that have ideological disagreements with the authoritarian right wing get their names published online with trump s rhetoric  this becomes especially problematic  there is the potential that such a list could be used not only to deny alumni donations from a school  but actually used by the more rabid of fuhrer trump s followers to target these men and women  conservatives believe this is a culture war  and they ll do anything to win featured image via screen capture
