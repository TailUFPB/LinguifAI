the fbi had just announced that it was clearing democratic nominee hillary clinton in the most recent email probe  and donald trump responded by having an epic meltdown in front of everyone at the freedom hill amphitheater in michigan on sunday in speaking to the crowd  the republican nominee whined and moaned once again that the election is rigged and made it clear that he still thinks she s guilty as ever  trump shouted  right now she s being protected by a rigged system  it s a totally rigged system  i ve been saying it for a long time  you can t review   emails in eight days  you can t do it folks  hillary clinton is guilty  hillary clinton is guilty  she knows it  the fbi knows it  the people know it and now it s up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on  november  you can watch trump throw his temper tantrum below donald trump responds to fbi letter   you can t review   new emails in  days   https   t co  https   t co   abc news   abc  november    the record  the fbi actually can cover that kind of groundwork in eight days  but since when has the donald ever been interested in thinking logically or sharing facts   completely missing the irony in what he would say next  trump warned  the investigations into her crimes will go on for a long  long time  trump was obviously projecting onto clinton  because he currently has thousands of lawsuits against him  not including the high profile sexual assault cases that have recently come to light after his lewd comments on an audio tape were uncovered  or the fact that he hasn t paid his taxes in decades  if anyone should be worried about being guilty of wrongdoing  it s definitely trump   and it s something we should keep in mind on election day tomorrow featured image via joe raedle   getty images
