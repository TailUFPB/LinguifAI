remember back in may when donald trump said he d make california  new york and maryland compatible  and that he d win them   well it s now mid october and he can barely hang on to red states utah  georgia  arizona and even texas   the latest poll out of the lone star state has him leading by three points  romney won texas by  points in  there is one state in particular that is leaning towards hillary clinton   arizona the grand canyon state  home to sheriff joe arpaio  jan brewer  and the god awful sb   should be a dead set win for trump  whose anti immigration rhetoric has propelled him to where he is today  however  recent polling out of the state suggests that clinton has the upper hand  and for good reason according to a new arizona republic morrison cronkite news poll released just before the third presidential debate  hillary clinton is leading donald trump by five points    percent  gary johnson took six percent while jill stein took one percent  twenty percent remain undecided however  when pressed on how those who  lean  one way or the other would solidly vote  as of right now  both clinton and trump expand their lead when including  leaners  in the sample  the number of undecideds drops to   percent  clinton s support rises to   percent while trump s support increases to   percent  johnson gets   percent while stein gets   percent  the margin of error for the sample including the leaners is plus or minus  percentage points in nate silver s fivethirtyeight general election projection  clinton has a  percent chance of winning arizona s  electoral votes  compared to trump s  percent chance  in the last  polls conducted in the state  clinton holds the edge in   trump in   and a tie in three it is because of these shocking poll results that the clinton campaign is pumping more than   million in advertising in the state and sending a slew of high profile surrogates   including first lady michelle obama and senator bernie sanders   all across the state the last time arizona went blue was in   when voters chose bill clinton over senator bob dole by  percent imagine if arizona  a state most affected by illegal immigration  stuck it to trump on election day  arizona is proving to have a rich  culturally diverse electorate  buoyed by latino and hispanic voters who don t take too kindly to trump s xenophobic  racist tones ana navarro was right   if trump thought insulting mexicans and hispanics was the right move  he s going to have one hell of a wake up call in november featured image via alex wong getty images
