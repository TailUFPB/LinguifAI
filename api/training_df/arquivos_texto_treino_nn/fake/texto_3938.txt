generally  it s considered rather unprofessional to comment on someone s looks rather than their actions or words  but it s hard not to notice one very strange and unusual occurrence  throughout the decades  donald trump skin pallor has turned from the normal white guy shade of beige to a color which is best represented by a pumpkin now  the rings around his eyes pretty much prove that trump either spends time in tanning beds or he is a fan of fake spray tans  either of which would involve tiny goggles  well  according to a mother jones expose  it could be either  but that s not the news  the news is why trump seems to be such a fan of fake tans and it gives you a glimpse into the type of cronyism we could expect if trump were to become president trump is good friends with an indiana businessman named steve hilbert  in   hilbert became the ceo of new sunshine  a company that makes tanning beds  spray tanning booths  tanning lotions  and bronzers trump and hilbert have a lot in common  they are the same age  they are both rich  they both change wives about as often as trump supporters change underwear  sorry  and they both have hideous  garish taste in decorating  hilbert  when he was an insurance ceo  was one of the country s highest paid and he even helicoptered to work   a whole two miles the businessman reportedly met his sixth and current wife in the early   when she jumped topless out of a cake at a party for one of his stepsons  the cake story may be apocryphal  but tomisue hilbert  who is the same age as melania  was indeed a  year old topless dancer and a single mother when she married steve the hilberts once lived in a three story    square foot faux french mansion dubbed le chateau renaissance  which was located on a  acre compound outside indianapolis that included a   square foot  sports barn  with a full size reproduction of the indiana university basketball court  the mansion  once valued at   million  featured trumpesque gold plated bathroom fixtures and french crystal chandeliers  hand painted murals adorned a dome above the entryway  including one depicting a toga clad steve hilbert as an ancient deity the men had been friends for nearly  years when they entered into a business deal together  they bought the general motors building in manhattan for   million  hilbert put up far more money than trump did    million vs    million plus there was a third partner  but somehow  trump received a  percent interest in the building  he also put his name on the building the two men  along with their wives du jour  also socialize together  they stay in each other s vacation homes  they attend each other s multiple weddings after a disastrous departure from his company  conseco  hilbert started the tanning business  while mother jones doesn t know for sure that trump uses his products  they do say this this is also around the time that trump started to turn orange  did the hilberts get trump into tanning  does he use new sunshine spray tans or tanning bed bronzers   reviewers have suggested that turning orange a  rich shade of burnt orange   in the words of one can be a distinct side effect of using such products   the trump campaign did not respond to questions about whether trump used new sunshine tanning products  questions sent by email and fedex to hilbert s indiana home went unanswered  it s clear  though  that trump is familiar with new sunshine s wares  he promoted the company s tanning products on the celebrity apprentice in two episodes there s more to the story  which includes some pretty shady business deals  but at least we might now know why trump is that awful shade of orange featured image via john sommers ii getty images
