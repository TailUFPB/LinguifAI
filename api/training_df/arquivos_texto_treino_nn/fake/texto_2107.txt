earlier today  donald trump had a joint conference with german chancellor angela merkel  and he used it as an opportunity to embarrass himself  and the rest of the united states  in front of yet another world leader  sadly  this is a pattern that the once highly respected america is becoming used to when trump was asked if he regretted some of his tweets  particularly his insane wiretapping accusations against former president barack obama  trump failed miserably in his attempt to handle the situation and redeem himself with merkel  who he d been criticizing for the past few months after she allowed syrian refugees into her country trump stated that he  very seldom  regrets the things he posts on twitter  right before turning to merkel and making a reference to the unfounded wiretapping accusation he created  trump suggested that perhaps the two of them had something in common  in an attempt to make a joke about obama s surveillance of germany s administration and press  the problem was  it took several moments for anyone in the audience to get the joke  and the tension in the room was nothing but awkward and uncomfortable as everyone tried to figure out just what the hell trump was talking about you can watch this strange moment unfold below  thanks to msnbc this humiliating moment was just one of the memorable instances between merkel and trump today  trump embarrassed himself again during a sit down meeting with the german chancellor by turning down her offer to shake hands  making himself seem even more offensive and rude than ever before  considering trump s horrendous track record with women  he couldn t have chosen a more disrespectful thing to do  then again  i guess we should all be thankful that he didn t grab her by the p ssy trump continues to make the u s  look horrible in front of other countries  and it s only been two months  i don t even want to think about the damage he could do to our reputation in four years  hopefully  he won t last that long featured image via justin sullivan getty images
