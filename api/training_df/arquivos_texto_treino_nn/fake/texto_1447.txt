conservatives thought an unpredictable president would be a good idea  but as it turns out  to be the leader of the free world  you have to measure your words  think before you talk  and above all  don t reveal highly classified data  monday night  after it was discovered that amateur president donald trump bragged to russian officials  then revealed intelligence information to them  his white house staffers were heard screaming in a nearby office  it was like a white house slap fight was taking place with no one able to contain the damage it gets worse trump s national security and foreign policy staffs have been spending much of their time planning for his upcoming eight day trip to the middle east and europe  the former reality show star is meeting with foreign leaders after his major blunder with sensitive information the new york times reports there is a growing sense that mr  trump seems unwilling or unable to do the things necessary to keep himself out of trouble  and that the presidency has done little to tame a shoot from the hip into his own foot style that characterized his campaign there is a fear among some of mr  trump s senior advisers about leaving him alone in meetings with foreign leaders out of concern he might speak out of turn  general mcmaster  in particular  has tried to insert caveats or gentle corrections into conversations when he believes the president is straying off topic or onto boggy diplomatic ground  my emphasis according to two officials  mcmaster s gentle corrections has irked trump  and remember  trump has publicly declared that his former security adviser  michael flynn  was a  wonderful man   trump said that after flynn was forced to resign trump has said that general mcmaster talks too much in meetings  and the former reality show star has referred to him as  a pain   according to one of the officials in private  three administration officials conceded that they could not publicly articulate their most compelling   and honest   defense of the president  that mr  trump  a hasty and indifferent reader of printed briefing materials  simply did not possess the interest or knowledge of the granular details of intelligence gathering to leak specific sources and methods of intelligence gathering that would do harm to united states allies in december  trump said   i don t need daily intelligence briefings   tuesday morning  trump admitted on twitter that he revealed the intel to the russian officials  a few hours later  mcmaster held a press briefing to do damage control  he bizarrely explained that since trump didn t know where the intel came from  it was  wholly inappropriate  for him to disclose it it suddenly makes sense why white house press secretary sean spicer was recently seen hiding in the bushes photo by mario tama getty images
