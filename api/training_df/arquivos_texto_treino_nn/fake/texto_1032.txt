if there is one thing going for the american people against trump s assault on decency  liberties  and intelligence it s that he and his team are so incompetent that they can t even do the simplest things without humiliating themselves  an obvious example of that sheer stupidity comes at us from this pro trump ad  which he recently proudly posted to his facebook page thanks to the crack team over at the white house  a simple spelling mistake turned trump s coal fetish into a call to relax child labor laws  in boasting about his efforts to kill clean energy and bring back coal  he promised to  put our minors back to work  the word he was looking for was  miners   apparently  nobody at trump s white house noticed the typo  it s been six hours and nobody has bothered to fix it  either this would be a funny gaffe if it weren t so depressingly common  trump has issued statements misspelling the names and titles of foreign leaders  trump has misspelled words as simple and varied as  denmark   denmakr    honored   honered    among   amoung   and  unprecedented   unpresidented  a white house statement bragging about betsy devos spelled  education  wrong  she s the secretary of education the library of congress gift shop had to pull a poster honoring trump s inauguration when people noticed it  too  had an ridiculously simple typo no joke  purchasable copy of trump s inauguration print  direct from the library of congress site  a  grader would ve spotted this typo  pic twitter com zomwsmojyv  jules winnfield     february     trump s minor miner gaffe has another unfortunate side effect for his administration   reminding us that his good friend newt gingrich actually wants to repeal child labor laws  as writer parker molloy points out  newt  a full time moron who moonlights as a part time shithead on evenings and weekends  once called child labor laws  truly stupid  and suggested poor kids be encouraged to become janitors at their schools  picking up the trash of their classmates to earn lunch money speaking at the john f  kennedy school  gingrich said that children in the poorest neighborhoods are  trapped in child laws  that prevent them from earning money  most of these schools ought to get rid of the unionized janitors  have one master janitor and pay local students to take care of the school   gingrich said according to a cnn video trump hasn t gone that far  he s only hinted that he would prefer children work  during obama s administration when he was eager to pretend the unemployment rate was sky high he would sometimes count children as part of his inflated unemployment figures instead of worrying about coal miners and school aged minors  trump  who was born rich and stayed that way  might want to invest in some additional schooling for himself  basic grammar and spelling would be a good place to start featured image via scott olson getty images
