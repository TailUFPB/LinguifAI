the congressional black caucus just broke it down for house speaker paul ryan  explaining to him in no uncertain terms that rep  devin nunes  r calif   obviously can t be trusted and needs to be removed as chairman of the intelligence committee  this action is necessary in order to meet the public s expectation that congress conducts an impartial investigation into a matter that threatens the core of our democracy   the cbc wrote in a statement issued wednesday  congressman nunes  recent actions have caused him to lose the confidence of members of his committee  and  more importantly  the american people  and he can no longer be trusted with the information that the committee receives  some lawmakers are calling for nunes to recuse himself from the russia investigation  others  like the cbc  are calling on ryan to remove him as intel chair altogether  the caucus is also demanding that a special  bipartisan commission  be formed to handle the probe into russia s election meddling and trump s possible collusion  congress must create an independent  bipartisan commission to expose the full truth about any and all trump russia connections and collusion   the statement reads   the american people want and deserve to know if their government has been compromised by the kremlin  the black caucus is not alone  democrats have been calling on nunes to recuse himself from the investigation into russia s interference in the presidential election  he landed himself in hot water last week when he decided it would be a great idea to announce that intelligence on donald trump had been gathered accidentally while monitoring other people of interest  such as the russian ambassador  without bothering to mention it to the committee first all hell broke loose when nunes then decided he should brief trump on the matter  to make matters worse  it later came out that he secretly visited the white house the night before the announcement was made  leading some to question where his information came from in the first place featured image via drew angerer getty images
