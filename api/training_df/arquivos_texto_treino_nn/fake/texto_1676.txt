healthcare plan he endorsed to replace obamacare  trump is holding the highest office in the land and cannot legislate  he s an abject failure who has duped his supporters into believing that he will build a wall across our southern border  lock hillary clinton up  defeat isis and repeal obamacare on day one  none of that is happening and yet  his supporters stick by him  however  on social media  there appears to be less enthusiasm for the amateur president he can t defeat isis while banning refugees who are fleeing from terror at the hands of isis  it plays right into the terrorist group s agenda  also      photo by joe raedle getty images
