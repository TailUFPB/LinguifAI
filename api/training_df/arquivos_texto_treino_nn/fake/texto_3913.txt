trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isn t hard  getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is  same thing with bullying  but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted  and to whom  now  the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trump s lies for just six weeks  and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies  which you can find here there are literally hundreds of lies in trump s speeches  they re not all   unique  but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone  including his enemies  while keeping his supporters happy is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much  tons of people claim hillary is a master liar  but first  she s actually more honest than most politicians  second  even if she could be considered anything like a master liar  she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way  shape or form the star put the lies into a whopping  categories  clinton s policies  wtf  daesh middle east  clinton s record  african americans inner cities  the clintons  corruption  rigged election  trade economy  health care  trump s endorsements  refugees immigration  polls  obama s record  the campaign  russia  trump s record  taxes  sex assault allegations  clinton s health and government corruption they also compiled a list of the top  types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis  beginning with   the electoral system is rigged   of course  it s rigged against him  after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates  trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election   rigged  became his catchword he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired  thugs  to cause violence at his rallies  twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton  he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia  chicago and st  louis   cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats in greeley  colo   trump told his supporters if they don t trust mail in ballots  they should vote again in person  so  one did  trump supporter terri lynn rote  a  year old from iowa  was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice  nobody s committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans another is   muslims are risky   this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria  who could be the great trojan horse of our time  his claims that syrian refugees    per cent are muslim   are terrorists plays to the fears of the  other   even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children  and their numbers is nowhere near trump s claims   about   have been admitted to the united states in   the polls favour trump   har de har har   trump only looks at the polls he likes  and they re usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls  very few of the established  scientific polls favor him  nevertheless  it seems clear trump manipulates  exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is  this  poll denialism  gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data  suggests cnn his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling   and perhaps even the vote itself  if supporters feel trump should be doing better  then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible on oct    he said  i won the last two debates  and every poll showed it   in fact  every scientific poll showed that he lost of course  when unscientific online polls came out in his favour  trump was quick to promote   and exaggerate   those numbers  but these are just a few of his biggest  most repeated lies  he has also and so many more  just in the last six weeks  yes  many of them are repeats  but lies are lies  if trump sees this  he ll likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the paper s lying  and continue to sell the myth that he s not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies to see the full list and detailed analysis  click here featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
