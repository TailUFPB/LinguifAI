it s no secret that german chancellor angela merkel is no fan of donald trump  they had a frosty visit when she visited the united states  he infamously refused to shake her hand for the cameras as is customary in the oval office  and even reportedly presented her with some kind of bogus  bill  for supposed expenses with regards to financial obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization  nato  combine that with the fact that trump publicly scolded our fellow nato member nations at the summit in brussels  and you have a recipe for chancellor merkel coming to a very grave conclusion  the united states of america can no longer be trusted to defend its nato allies and support article v   which states that when one nation is attacked  all nations are attacked   as long as donald trump is president  this is an especially striking blow  since the only time article v of nato has been invoked is when the u s  was attacked on september    with all of this in mind  merkel has made a stunning and historic statement to her fellow member nations of the european union  thanks to trump  america is not to be relied on any longer  merkel said of trump s america  the times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out  i ve experienced that in the last few days  we europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands  merkel had the same advice regarding great britain  though with less harsh words  she still insists that respectful relationships with britain and america will be maintained  but told the remaining european union nations  we have to fight for our own destiny  another warning came as a result of trump s refusal to commit to the paris climate agreement at the  summit  all of the other six member nations of the agreement reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the problem of climate change  but trump   and thus the united states   did not  merkel said that this is a  very difficult  not to say very unsatisfactory  development and a six against one  dialogue with regards to a grave world matter  a matter that  by the way  trump has previously called a hoax  here is the tweet that confirms his crazy views there the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u s  manufacturing non competitive   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    short  with donald trump as president  the united states of america is no longer the leader of the free world  germany is  hopefully  merkel gets re elected  and can diminish trump s power on the world stage until he is either impeached and removed from office  resigns  or his term ends the fate of the free world depends on it featured image via justin sullivan getty images
