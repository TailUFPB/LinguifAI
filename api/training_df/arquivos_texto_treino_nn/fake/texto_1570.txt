politicians are all about photo ops  this is especially true of high ranking  smarmy types like house speaker paul ryan  however  speaker ryan s opportunism got the best of him during the congressional break this weekend  when he wound up taking a picture with a  resistance activist while ryan himself was wearing an apron at a shelter of some sort and pretending to care about people of course  the members of congress are taking their break amid the worst  most cruel and craven healthcare bill that has been passed in living memory  and millions of americans are understandably upset at the prospect of the republicans taking their healthcare away as these rich assholes celebrate in the white house rose garden with donald trump  after all  all the house gop cares about is a win for their egotistical orange  president   therefore  it should come as no surprise that a  protester wearing a  pod save america  t shirt that read repeal and go f ck yourself   and that was signed  gop   took the opportunity to troll speaker ryan so expertly  here is the shot  via twitter couple friends of the pod hanging out this morning   jonfavs  jonlovett   pic twitter com   j   minnysconsin  may     in other words  either paul ryan knows people hate him around the nation  or he is too ignorant to realize how much people hate him  or  most likely  he s been in congress so long he thinks he cannot get voted out  and therefore doesn t care what his policies do to ordinary americans   up to an including death   just so long as he and his rich buddies get their tax cuts  the latter is the most likely scenario  and we should all remember that  wisconsinites   look at who this guy is  vote  him  out  shock him in   for this  speaker  into early retirement  and install a democratic government that will work for you  not the rich featured image via drew angerer getty images
