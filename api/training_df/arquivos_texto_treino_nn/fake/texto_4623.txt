house speaker paul ryan sold his soul the day he endorsed donald trump to be president of the united states  it was clear that he was just being a spineless  cowardly weasel when he did so  as he did it under cover of a big policy speech by democratic nominee hillary clinton  ever since then  ryan s relationship with trump has been frosty at best  and they have never appeared on stage together during a weekly press briefing  ryan got the one question everyone has been asking  why hasn t donald trump released his tax returns  this is especially pressing right now  as newsweek just printed a damning story that shows that should donald trump become president  the trump organization s rather dubious web of international ties would endanger the national security of the united states of america  with that revelation  it is even more imperative than ever that the american electorate sees trump s tax returns  hell  even george w  bush s ethics lawyer said that these ties are a  quote   serious problem  therefore  ryan finally caved and said trump s returns need to be made public  first  he referenced his own releasing of his taxes when he ran for vice president  i did release my returns  i ll defer to donald trump as to when he thinks the appropriate time to release his returns  i know he is under audit  and he has an opinion on when to release those and i ll defer to him on that  he then hedged  though  because he is a coward who is afraid of upsetting trump s supporters  and said  i released mine  i think he should release his  i ll leave it to him when to do it  no  speaker ryan  you need to get forceful with this  we need the returns now  with all of the shadiness surrounding trump s business dealings and ties to nefarious characters around the world  this is vital information for the nation and world to know  trump is trying to run the clock out on this one  to keep the voting public from knowing just what he gets up to  do your job  and demand trump s tax returns featured image via win mcnamee getty images
