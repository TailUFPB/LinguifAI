welcome to trump s america  a k a  trumplandia  people are saying it s not going to be that bad  everything will be okay  etc   without realizing just what trump s rise has already unleashed here  now  with his win  haters  bigots and white supremacists are more likely to openly express their hate since trump has made doing so  okay  in america that s sorely evident at maple grove senior high school  where students arrived only to find a classroom door vandalized with epithets and white supremacist messages  how do we know this is because of trump  take a look the rest of the door reads    fuckallporchmonkeys   whitesonly   whiteamerica  trump train   as near as we can tell  the very bottom reads   blacks   in an oval with an  x  through it  this is how we know trump and his win inspired this you can see that the man who posted the image to facebook  fred ndip  says his son no longer feels safe at school  indeed  he may not be  and like many parents whose children will start experiencing this  ndip doesn t know what to tell him this is what we re faced with  children and teens who already face the sharpest  worst bullying because of who they are and what they look like now get to feel it ten fold in many places  how is ndip s son to convince himself that this is just some graffiti and nobody will actually hurt anyone it s not  just words  and harmless fun  children learn hate from their parents and their elders  children who listened to trump s hate and watched their parents support it and repeat it just learned that their hatred is perfectly fine  this kind of thing is likely just the beginning  many schools will probably see an uptick in bullying  particularly against anyone who isn t white or christian the damage to our children  along to everyone else who will be tossed under the bus when the gop does its thing  is incalculable  this is one of those times where many of us are hoping we re wrong  and they won t do what we ve been told they want to do  but we re not holding our breath and the hate will continue and will grow because we elected one of the most hateful men imaginable to the white house  he s an example  and he s made it okay to hate featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
