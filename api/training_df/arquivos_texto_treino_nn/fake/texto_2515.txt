corey lewandowski was donald trump s right hand man up until the undeserving potus decided to fire him from his position as campaign manager  even after being rejected by trump  lewandowski continued to humiliate himself on cnn by posing as trump s spokesperson while he happily accepted money from trump  things came to a head when lewandowski realized he couldn t get into the inauguration   but still hadn t embarrassed himself enough  apparently with all things trump related  it could always get worse according to a new report by buzzfeed news  lewandowski is using access to trump s twitter account as an incentive for potential clients  apparently  lewandowski has already told potential clients like facebook and financial group blackstone group that he can access the account  and four sources say that it s become normal for lewandowski to use trump s account as a selling point as usual  lewandowski is choosing to deny the reports  when confronted by a buzzfeed reporter who had spoken to these four sources  lewandowski fired back  i know facts don t matter to buzzfeed but it s not true  lewandowski elaborated that he d  never  even met with facebook or blackstone group  taking a page right out of trump s book  he said  i never met blackstone  please make sure you accurately report that  i doubt you will  trump and the rest of his incompetent team have also stated that lewandowski cannot access trump s beloved twitter account there s good reason to believe that lewandowski would stoop low enough to use trump s social media accounts as selling points for clients  he was a major part of trump s team on the campaign trail  and we all know that anyone working this closely to trump can t possibly be an honest person  lewandowski  much like his former boss  was a lying snake who would use anything to leverage his own success  it doesn t seem out of character at all for lewandowski to do this   and he likely learned that mentality from trump himself featured image via joe raedle   getty images
