president donald trump just completed his first foreign trip and the verdict is decidedly mixed as to how well he fared in europe  for his part  trump is saying his entire visit to the middle east and europe was a  home run   not everyone is so convinced an official with the state department told the daily beast that the president behaved like a  drunk tourist   the official continued to say   when it comes to diplomacy  president trump is a drunk tourist loud and tacky  shoving his way around the dance floor  he steps on others without realizing it  it s ineffectual  trump s problems started in vatican city when he met with pope francis  the pope and trump have clashed before  last year the pontiff questioned trump s faith and said that anyone who pushes building walls rather than bridges is  not christian   trump blasted back and slammed the pope for questioning his faith  from a comment francis made to first lady melania trump about the president s weight to the meeting itself  where the pope asked trump to rethink his stance on climate change  the meetings were fraught with tension that tension continued when trump arrived at the  meetings  first  he pushed the prime minister of montenegro out of the way so he could be at the front of the photo of the world leaders
