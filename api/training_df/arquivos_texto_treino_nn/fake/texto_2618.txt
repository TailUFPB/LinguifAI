when it comes to strategizing an offense against donald trump and the republicans  dr  martin luther king jr  and coretta scott king s daughter bernice king might just be on to something while the words and actions of trump are horrific all by themselves  it s important to remember that he is not working alone  he has the support of those working closely around him and the support of the republican party  so far  they ve been backing his ideas and confirming all his nominations for his cabinet here s what king has to say about all of this some wise advice circulating   use  name sparingly so as not to detract from the issues  i believe that everyone  regardless of their beliefs  deserves the dignity of being called by their name  however  this is a strategic tactic  while we are so focused on him we are prone to neglect the questionable policies that threaten freedom  justice and fairness advanced by the administration   remember this is a regime and he s not acting alone   do not argue with those who support him and his policies it doesn t work   focus on his policies  not his appearance and mental state   keep your message positive  those who oppose peace and justice want the country to be angry and fearful because this is the soil from which their darkest policies will grow   no more helpless hopeless talk   support artists and the arts   be careful not to spread fake news  check it   take care of yourselves    resist keep demonstrations peaceful  in the words of john lennon   when it gets down to having to use violence  then you are playing the system s game  the establishment will irritate you   pull your beard  flick your face   to make you fight  because once they ve got you violent  then they know how to handle you  the only thing they don t know how to handle is non violence and humor  when you post or talk about him  don t assign his actions to him  assign them to  the republican administration   or  the republicans   this will have several effects  the republican legislators will either have to take responsibility for their association with him or stand up for what some of them don t like  he will not get the focus of attention he craves  republican representatives will become very concerned about their re elections   king posts this only one day after senator elizabeth warren  d ma  got shut down by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  on the senate floor for reading coretta scott king s letter from  years ago condemning jeff sessions it s time to remember that it s not only trump we have the responsibility to hold accountable  but all republicans  and this post from bernice king is definitely a good start read more featured photo by hulton archive getty images
