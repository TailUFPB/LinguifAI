when you see a trump supporter parroting his blatantly false talking point about the electoral process being  rigged   just send them to istheelectionrigged com recent polls have been disappointing for trump and his followers  to say the least  in response they ve began to accuse the election of being rigged  but where is there proof  because we have plenty of facts that say otherwise the electoral process in america is thorough  to say the least  thorough enough to earn the united states an   score on the electoral process from freedom house  an independent  nonprofit organization that rates democratic institutions  you can find their reasoning through the link above voter fraud  for example  is virtually nonexistent  in   a study showed that out of a billion ballots casted since   there s only been  cases of voter fraud  so where s this fraud trump is talking about  oh  wait  it s just another one of his lies the right wing really screwed us over when they chose trump as their candidate  he s brought nothing good to our country  ever  donald trump is a child  and what do children do when they don t get their way  they whine  saying it s unfair or try to blame it on someone else  there is no fraud going on in our election  donald is just running out of excuses  he s a liar  just saying what people want to hear  his supporters are the type of people to follow blindly  never actually doing the research themselves   otherwise they wouldn t be his supporters  this is slightly worrisome  especially with recent talk of taking up arms against the corruption  trump s rhetoric is undermining faith in united states democracy  with absolutely no evidence of fraud or wrongdoing  he s taking advantage of low information voters and  through his own narcissism and grand stupidity  may cause violence to break out when he inevitably loses  make sure to vote   there s no proof of fraud or  rigging  in our electoral process  and there s been plenty to disprove it  unfortunately  it s incredibly doubtful that this news will stop trump and his supporters from angrily blaming the system for trump s failure
