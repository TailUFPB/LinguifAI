donald trump and all of the people around him have a serious problem with the truth  that problem is giving them serious legal problems that do not have to be when it comes to special counsel robert mueller s investigation into the trump campaign s possible collusion with the russians to try and fix the  election first  they said there were not meetings with russians  then  we find out that donald trump jr   former trump campaign manager paul manafort  and trump s son in law jared kushner met with a shady russian lawyer  along with other people tied to the russian government  after that  trump jr  came out with a statement saying that they were talking about russian adoptions and nothing else  then  that statement fell apart when it turns out that they went into that meeting thinking they were going to get dirt on then democratic nominee hillary clinton from the russian government  now  it turns out that while the lawyers wanted to be truthful in trump jr  s statement  donald trump decided he wanted to lie for his son  and personally put together the statement trump s advisers are furious  one said  on condition of anonymity  to the washington post  this was       unnecessary  now someone can claim he s the one who attempted to mislead  somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn t want you to say the whole truth  the adviser then went on to suggest that trump doesn t fully understand that he and his people are in serious legal trouble over the russia investigation  he refuses to sit still  he doesn t think he s in any legal jeopardy  so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself  a lawyer who investigated president george w  bush regarding the unmasking of cia agent valerie plame  peter zeidenberg  says of the bumbling attempt at a cover up by team trump  the thing that really strikes me about this is the stupidity of involving the president  they are still treating this like a family run business and they have a pr problem        what they don t seem to understand is this is a criminal investigation involving all of them  well  hopefully  they continue to screw up in their responses to this  there s definitely wrongdoing here  perhaps robert mueller already has the smoking gun  and wants to make sure the case is airtight before they are all indicted and hauled off to jail where belong  in the meantime  the entire administration is dangerous and should be removed  congress  do your jobs and throw all of these people out of our white house featured image via john moore getty images
