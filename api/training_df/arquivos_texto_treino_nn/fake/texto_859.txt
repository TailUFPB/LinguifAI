keeping in line with his constant backtracking and just generally erratic ways  president donald trump has taken a softer stance on what was seen as essentially his core campaign promise by claiming that the   mile long wall he initially intended to build along the border with mexico may not need to cover the full distance due to natural borders that already exist  you have mountains  you have some rivers that are violent and vicious  you have some areas that are so far away that you don t really have people crossing   the president told reporters aboard air force one on his recent flight to paris   but you ll need anywhere from  to  miles  trump made the construction of a big beautiful wall  with a big beautiful door   a solid structure  feet high in an effort to curb illegal immigration the cornerstone of his  election campaign  insisting that mexico would pay for it with the cost estimated to be in the vicinity of   billion  although he later stated that could be cut by covering the wall in solar panels  naturally mexico has refused to pay  most likely because they never requested the border wall in the first place  however  trump still believes he will find a way to get them to cough up the cash after construction begins but if you believe that the president s insistence that mexico will reimburse the us for construction for the wall is the only flaw in his plan  you are sadly mistaken  first of all  almost all of that   to  miles  that trump mentioned  less than half of the length of the us mexico border  already has walls and fences  in fact  the current border wall is already  miles long  also  as for the rivers that are  violent and vicious   yes a large part of the border in texas consists of the rio grande  but some parts of that river are barely more than a trickle of water president trump also now believes the border wall needs to be transparent  you have to be able to see through it   he said   as horrible as it sounds  when they throw the large sacks of drugs over  and if you have people on the other side of the wall  you don t see them  they hit you on the head with  pounds of stuff  it s over  we re now six months into his presidency and trump has only requested    billion from congress for the project  or roughly  percent of the total estimate  maybe he has just learned that according to pew research center  approximately  percent of the illegal immigrants in the us have been here for at least a decade  that the amount of illegal mexican immigrants has been in decline for the last  years and is now one million less than it was in   or that mexicans only make up  percent of illegal immigrants in the united states featured image via sandy huffaker getty images
