in this  metoo moment  many powerful men are being toppled  it spans many industries  from entertainment  to journalism  to politics and beyond  any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass  molest  or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out  publicly shamed  and forced into early retirement well  unfortunately  the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker  kentucky state representative dan johnson left a suicide note on facebook and then shot himself on a bridge  according to reports from local authorities  bullitt county sheriff donnie tinnell reported to local station wdrb that johnson s body was found after his suicide note from facebook was reported to the local police  here is that note now  nobody wants to celebrate a suicide  this man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser  who was a friend of his daughter s  who says that johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home  apparently  johnson  who referred to himself as some kind of  pope   routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors  johnson s home was called the  pope s house   and he was the preacher at the heart of fire city church  where the alleged molestation took place now  innocent until proven guilty and all of that  but if someone commits suicide  it s likely there could be some merit there  that s a rather extreme measure to take  further  by all accounts  this guy was no saint  he was heavily pro gun  opposed any and all abortion rights  and has referred to president barack obama and first lady michelle obama as monkeys on his facebook page  among other racist messages and images again  we re not glad the man is dead  but  it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was  we grieve for the loss his children  wife  and grandchildren suffered  for nobody deserves such a loss  however  methinks the people of kentucky are much better off  sad to say  but true featured image via screen capture
