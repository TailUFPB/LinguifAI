there s some funny business happening this weekend at the jersey shore  and it s not the usual shenanigans you have in mind  a democratic group is flying a huge banner today over the very busy beaches of the jersey shore with a hilarious anti trump message the banner that reads  trump is on vacation with your     is being flown by the outspoken bridge project  they are flying it from beach haven all the way up north to sea bright the group cleverly chose this location and weekend because the president is spending a leisurely weekend golfing at his nj beach resort  flying this banner is the perfect way to highlight the fact that trump is spending every weekend golfing at the beach   rather than doing his job   and to embarrass him about it  bigly the irony of trump spending all his weekends golfing is that he used to slam president obama on twitter for playing golf while in the office  now  even trump s fellow republicans are recognizing that he is majorly out golfing obama  senator joni ernst from iowa said in an april town hall speech that trump needs to spend way less time at mar a lago in florida if he wants to be an effective president  i do wish he would spend more time in washington  d c  that s what we have the white house for  by april trump had spent as much time traveling during his presidency than obama did during the entire two terms in the white house  besides not being in d c  doing his job  just one of trump s weekend getaways cost taxpayers    million maybe this banner will help trump to see the error of his ways  ok  probably not  but at least it will embarrass the shit out of him photo by mike ehrmann getty images
