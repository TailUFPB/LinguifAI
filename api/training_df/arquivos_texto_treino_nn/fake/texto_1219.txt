republicans are once again putting their party before their country  just before the highly anticipated testimony from fired fbi director james comey  gop senators marco rubio  r fl  and tom cotton  r al  went scurrying down to the white house like good little republican sycophants to have dinner with donald trump nevermind the optics of this  nevermind the fact that it is at best highly inappropriate to put themselves into a situation where trump might try to lean on them to go in a certain direction with their questioning of comey   none of that mattered to these two sniveling weasels  all they cared about was currying favor with their so called  president   and trying to cast him in as decent a light as possible these slimy tactics showed in their lines of questioning of comey on thursday as well  instead of focusing on comey s conversations with trump  and on trump s inappropriate  unethical  and possibly illegal behavior  rubio decided to focus instead on leaks  saying to comey  you know  this investigation is full of leaks  left and right  do you ever wonder why of all the things in this investigation the only thing that s never been leaked is the fact that the president was not personally under investigation  despite the fact that both democrats and republicans in the leadership of congress knew that and have known that for weeks  comey  unfazed by rubio s clear attempt to force him to make trump look good  simply said   i don t know  here is video of that exchange cotton s tactics were even slimier  he went after democratic senator dianne feinstein  d ca  regarding statements she had made regarding the russia matter during television appearances months ago  he reminded comey and america that at the time  senator feinstein had said on national television that she saw no evidence of team trump having worked with the russians  cotton then asked comey how he felt about those statements  again  comey didn t take the bait  and said  i don t doubt that sen  feinstein was saying what she understood  here is video of that exchange considering what we know about trump s penchant for pressuring people  it is entirely possible that at that dinner  rubio and cotton made some kind of loyalty pledge  it was clear from the questioning that these two senators had one goal and one goal only  to clear trump of any wrongdoing   be it legally or for political benefit in the minds of the american public so  there you have it  folks  the gop cares more about their party than they do their country  they don t care if there are russian stooges in the white house   just since those stooges are members of their party featured image via mark wilson getty images
