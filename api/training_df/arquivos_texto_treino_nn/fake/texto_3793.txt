there are a ton of potential conflict of interest problems cropping up as trump prepares to take office  one is his use of the secret service  he already made nearly   million from them during his campaign  and now he potentially stands to make millions more over the next four years  and probably won t hesitate to do so because that s just how greedy he is even as far back as   when trump first started thinking about a run at the white house  he knew he could make money for himself  back then  he combined paid speeches with his political appearances  making them paid political appearances  he actually admitted that he could be the first person to make money on the side as a presidential candidate so what s going on now  basically  the secret service has to pay for travel with candidates while they re campaigning  they paid both trump and hillary roughly    million each for travel  however  with hillary  that money helped with the costs of chartering a plane  so it s not like she actually just raked it in from them however  since trump was using his own airline for travel  they simply paid him the money for travel  yes  the costs associated with using those aircraft were rolled in  but trump owns the airline  therefore  the money essentially went into his own pocket he and melania will be flying around now on air force one and marine one  what about their kids  though  trump s adult children are up for unpaid positions in his administration  he can t officially hire family   also  the secret service is supposed to protect immediate family  like children  sure  they ll sometimes fly on the official presidential aircraft  but other times  they could be flying on trump s personal aircraft  possibly still with secret service protection and the secret service has to pay for that  it ll be the same as the campaign   that money will essentially go into trump s coffers no wonder he s willing to take a   salary as president  he sounds all wonderfully altruistic that way  but the truth his he has a huge opportunity to make millions anyway  even the    expense account is peanuts compared to what he stands to make by fleecing the secret service  that makes the gesture as hollow as the ceos with massive stock options who only take   salaries  they still make millions the blatant hate was obviously not enough  and now we have a man in the white house who will use the government to fatten his personal wallet as much as he can  who didn t see this coming featured by chip somodevilla via getty images
