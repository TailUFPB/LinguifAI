according to white house propaganda minister sean spicer  it was completely fine that conservatives endlessly delayed president obama s supreme court pick because it was his  fourth term  i know what you re thinking   the white house press secretary couldn t possibly be so stupid that he would not know how many terms a president can legally serve  two    but it s true  spicer explained that the democrats had a responsibility to confirm any  qualified  supreme court nominee of trump s despite the campaign last year to deprive president obama of the same courtesy  according to spicer  this is completely different because  there s never been a situation in which you had a fourth term  someone that late in an election cycle  that had never occurred before  and i think the senate republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice  and that s exactly what happened  yes  fourth term  we didn t even get the third term conservatives were sure obama would have and the rest of us desperately wish he could have had and spicer thinks he served for  years  but he is right that the obstruction on the part of the gop was unprecedented  there really is something unique about the position republican senators are taking with respect to the scalia vacancy   law professor jason mazzone told the new york times last year   we really did not find any precedent for the idea  notwithstanding the senate s very broad powers in this area  that a sitting president could be denied outright the authority to offer up a nominee who would receive evaluation through normal senate processes  there is a difference between the senate rejecting  as it s quite entitled to do  a particular nominee on the merits  and the senate taking the position that a president cannot exercise a constitutionally delegated power   he added trump s nominee isn t exactly qualified  as he has sided against the right of women to have available to them a full array of healthcare options  including a decision related to hobby lobby  he has also stated that  secular courts  do not have the right to interfere with  religion  even when businesses are practicing discrimination against women watch spicer s latest f ckup below featured image via screenshots
