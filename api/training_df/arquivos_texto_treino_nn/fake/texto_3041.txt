donald trump has nominated ben carson   an idiot in every area except that of brain surgery   to run the housing and urban development  hud  department  carson has no experience in urban development  government  real estate  or anything else relating to the job he s trying to be confirmed to do  and therefore has no business being nominated for it  therefore  his confirmation is   and should be    especially difficult  well  have no fear   massachusetts senator elizabeth warren made sure of that senator warren s first order of business was to make sure that donald trump  who is obviously a real estate tycoon  would not benefit from the activities of hud under ben carson  warren asked of carson  can you assure me that not a single taxpayer dollar you give out will financial benefit the president elect or his family  carson could not make that assurance directly  and said that he could only assure that would refuse to play favorites   continuing  i can assure you that the things that i do are driven by a sense of morals and values  that wasn t good enough for warren  though  and she pushed carson further  it s not about your good faith  my concern is whether or not  among the billions of dollars you will be responsible for handing out in grants and loans  can you just assure us that not   will go to benefit either the president elect or his family  carson said of that question  it will not be my intention to do anything to benefit   since carson refused to give any direct answers here  warren drew her own conclusions saying  do i take that to mean you may manage programs that will significantly benefit the president elect  carson insisted  you can take it to mean that i will manage things in a way that benefits the american people  carson went on to say that he wouldn t directly promise that he wouldn t use trump s family properties for hud programs  if there happens to be an extraordinary program that s working for millions of people  and it turns out that someone that you re targeting is going to gain   from it  am i going to say   no  the rest of you americans can t have it   i think logic and common sense probably would be the best way  warren concluded  the problem is that you can t assure us that hud money   not of   varieties but of multimillion dollar varieties   will not end up in the president elect s pockets  and that s just the problem  donald trump is surrounding himself with sycophants like ben carson  who will use their positions of power to do anything trump wants   including using federal dollars to line trump s pockets  if and when this guy is confirmed  we ll literally be paying donald trump  via our tax dollars through ben carson s hud department  to house low income families this is shaping up to be the most corrupt administration in modern history watch the exchange below   senwarren asks dr  ben carson   can you just assure us that not one dollar will go to benefit either the president elect or his family   pic twitter com   cspan   cspan  january    image via video screen capture
