donald trump supporters are so desperate to be in power that they are threatening america at gunpoint to vote for him or be killed that s what georgia trump fan jimmy arno is preparing for after the election votes are tallied in november because he expects a bloody civil war to break out in order to overthrow the government before hillary clinton is inaugurated arno is even considering joining a right wing militia  whom he collectively refers to as  patriots   because he seriously believes only they can defend the constitution  should martial law  civil war   whatever   break out in this country  they will uphold the constitution and rebuild our loss   he said   the war that s going to break out if hillary clinton s elected  if that happens  your patriots are going to overthrow the government  and of course  arno is a fan of the confederacy  loves the confederate flag  and has a portrait of robert e  lee hanging in his living room so basically  what arno is saying is that he believes the south will rise again and a civil war sequel will turn out differently  this time a rebellion will somehow succeed even though the united states military  including a navy and air force  would be standing in their way nevertheless  threats of civil war and violent rebellion are frightening but they also prove that conservatives are unfit to govern because apparently the only way they can do so is with a gun pressed against the heads of the people arno went on to blame president obama directly for the high racial tensions  i know that we were a whole lot further along racially eight years ago than we are today   he claims but the fact is that republicans raised those racial tensions themselves by vowing to make president obama fail from the start simply because of the color of his skin and their claim that he is an illegitimate president  the birther movement  of which trump is a prominent leader  contends that president obama is not one of us and that he wasn t born here  the election of president obama made racists  including arno  mad so they started publicly throwing a hissy fit and their tantrums have only gotten worse in the last eight years here s the audio via npr trump supporters are deplorable people who want to shoot and kill anyone who disagrees with them just so they can watch the world burn  if hillary clinton is elected president as she should be  conservatives need to accept that they lost instead of resorting to taking up arms against the country  such an action is treason and would only demonstrate that they are nothing more than sore losers who should never be allowed to get close to political power ever again featured image via screenshot
