donald trump is now demanding that any probe into his administration s connections to russia also include a probe into his wild allegation that president obama tapped his  wires  in trump tower  this dubious claim seems to have originated with a breitbart article that had been circulating among white house staff  the article in question claimed that president obama had ordered a wiretap under the foreign intelligence surveillance act  which allows a secret court to authorize surveillance in cases that involve agents of foreign powers   in this case  trump and two russian banks the article heavily referenced claimed made by conspiracy theorist mark levin on his far right radio show that  we absolutely know this is true  that obama was monitoring trump s team during the campaign  but now that his ridiculous allegations are being scrutinized by people who aren t completely batsh t insane  levin is doing everything he can to walk them back while still maintaining credibility with the stupid part of america during an appearance on fox news sunday  levin called for a release of fisa court applications that may or may not exist as well as all of the daily presidential intelligence briefings for the last  year or so   he added that this massive conspiracy that suddenly popped up when the russia situation was becoming too much for the trump team to handle wasn t limited to obama  every single democrat  according to levin  was involved in trying to take trump down asked about the level of president obama s involvement  levin gave himself a huge  out  i m not nostradamus here  i just think that we ought to find out in other words  he is pulling his claims out of thin air  via a spokesperson  president obama cleared up his level of involvement on saturday   there wasn t any  a cardinal rule of the obama administration was that no white house official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the department of justice   the spokesman said  as part of that practice  neither president obama nor any white house official ever ordered surveillance on any u s  citizen  donald trump is being attacked for  he tweeted   levin said  failing to note that he was the source of those allegations   donald trump is the victim  his campaign is the victim  his transition team is the victim  his surrogates are the victim  these are police state tactics  to some degree  levin is correct   but not in the way he thinks  trump has recently been demanding investigations of his critics  members of his administration have also threatened to  investigate  journalists who do not write nice things about the donald  one trump administration member confirmed that president asterisk was compiling  dossiers  on journalists he views as unfriendly  all of these things could very accurately be described as  police state tactics    but we re guessing levin meant something about his favorite bogeyman  barack obama levin admits there is no basis for his claim but that doesn t matter to donald trump or conservatives at large  by making the allegation knowing that people who can only be described as  idiots  would eat up  the republicans are demanding answers   and they will not be satisfied with any that do not paint barack obama as the monster they have known him to be ever since they realized he was black featured image via screengrab
