house speaker paul ryan finally admitted the reason he is refusing to hold town hall meetings  he s too afraid of protesters  speaking at a boy scouts event in wisconsin  ryan told the crowd that he just doesn t have the guts to face his own constituents when he knows they are p ssed that he s trying to steal their health care  aside from the obvious security concerns  what we have found is there are people who are trying to come in from out of the district to disrupt town hall meetings and not have a civil discussion  so what i have been doing is looking for new and creative ways to interact with my constituents in a civil way   ryan said  that s why i have done a number of telephone town hall meetings  which i find very effective as people don t have to travel  i do office hours  i just did them this morning in janesville  in addition  i am doing a lot of business ones   the speaker said ryan said that he has found other ways to meet with his constituents  like the town hall style meeting he held on thursday that was closed to the public with only  employees of the business he was touring in attendance  i find when you guys are there  people kind of clam up  they get a little nervous  but when you do business town halls without media it is very interactive  so i am finding a lot of different ways to have a good civil dialogue with constituents   he continued ryan then said that if people want to talk to him  that s what his office hours are for  which he explained help keep him safe from all those big  mean protesters  additionally  if you want to come do office hours  they schedule office hours because i don t want to have a situation where we just have a screaming fest  a shouting fest where people are being bussed in from out of the district to get on tv because they are yelling at somebody  that does nobody any good  and what i want to do is have a civil  good conversation with constituents  and that s why i do all these different things  whether it s planned tours  telephone town halls  office hours and the rest   he said so  that s ryan s master plan to deal with the ever increasing public anger over his plan to take health care from millions  he s just going to hide like the spineless coward that he is  sounds legit featured image via win mcnamee getty images
