the liberal  third world hell hole   as ann coulter calls it  that is california has some of the strictest gun control laws in the united states  far surpassing illinois and new york  naturally  republicans will use these facts to somehow smear the liberal state as being one that exhibits the most gun violence around   even though red states produce more gun violence per capita than blue surprisingly  what many people may not know   and what they won t hear on fox news   is that california has experienced a sharp decline in gun violence over the last  years  putting a fatal dent in the right s scare tactics when it comes to guns and the second amendment gavin newsome  california s current lieutenant governor  recently spoke at a press conference regarding prop   which limited magazine sizes  banned the sale of assault weapons  and conducted background checks on ammunition sales  it passed on election day by an overwhelming margin  during this press conference  newsome pointed to a very interesting statistic  since california began passing stricter gun laws in the   the state has seen a staggering  percent drop in gun homicides now  those were gavin newsome s numbers  and they took into account gun violence rate  if you look at the numbers from center for disease control  between  and   newsome s numbers did not include    the rate for murder rate has actually fallen  percent  from   per   residents in  to   per   in   the data for  and  are still being collected  and have not been factored into newsome s or the cdc s report whereas the state s gun laws may or may not be directly responsible   gun rights groups and gun control groups of course have differing opinions  naturally   it remains that the talking point  more gun control harms citizens  has been proven effectively false  in california of all places it looks like the good guys with the guns may not be stopping the bad guys with the guns  because guns have increasingly been hard to come by in he state  a trickle effect has been felt while red states like louisiana continue to top the list for gun murder and violence  blue states like california have taken action  and are literally saving lives in the process  in raw numbers    were killed in  compared to  when   were killed for the  all lives matter  bunch  this should be cause for celebration  and a big  you were right  the numbers for  and  should further these trends that have been set by liberal politicians  the only thing standing in the way between more un laws and more lives being saved is the nra midterm elections will be here before we know it featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
