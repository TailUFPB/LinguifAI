ever since donald trump came on the scene  famed political commentator keith olbermann has been on a tear with one mission and one mission only  to warn americans of the dangers of a trump presidency  during the campaign  olbermann had a show on gq s youtube channel called  the closer   now that trump has won  his efforts are called  the resistance  in olbermann s latest piece  he reminds us all what alexander hamilton said regarding the creation of the electoral college in the federalist papers  in short  hamilton s creation was largely an effort to be a safety valve of sorts  a check on the worst impulses of the public when it comes to choosing a president  hamilton said of the electoral college  the process of the electoral college affords a moral certainty  that the office of the president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications  in other words  hamilton created that government body to remedy precisely this situation  in that spirit  here is what keith olbermann has to say on the matter  first quoting hamilton  nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal  intrigue  and corruption  these most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from more than one quarter  but chiefly from the desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils  how could they better gratify this  than by raising a creature of their own to the chief magistracy of the union  then  olbermann himself says  if the electoral college is still not what hamilton described  it is still what hamilton intended  it is there to weed out the unqualified  the unprincipled  the merely famous  and especially to weed out  a creature  of foreign powers  or  in donald trump s case  all of the above  that s just the thing  the electoral college was never meant to be nothing but a formality and only a rubber stamp  quite the opposite  in fact  the meeting of the electors after the november election is supposed to be a serious deliberation on the qualifications of the president elect  if they deem that person unfit  then the electors have not just the authority  but the patriotic   and indeed constitutional   duty to install a person qualified for that office olbermann continues  this time turning to the confirmed russian interference in our  electoral process  with the clear intention   and eventual success   of electing trump  would it be an act of victory over the russians who committed an act of war against us by interfering with our election  would it be defense against trump and this banana republican government of his which will turn the world over to vladimir putin and  oh by the way  end our democracy  before you answer that  answer this  we can t have clinton  alexander hamilton is dead  and the alternative is an unelected dictator  would you now trade donald trump for a president mitt romney  a president john mccain or a president evan mcmullin  me  in a heartbeat  you re damn right i d take any of those three over trump  as much as i d rather have hillary  i ll take romney or mccain gladly   and i d especially love mcmullin  since he s been busily sounding the alarm on how dangerous trump is this entire time  he is reasonable and would do a good job  further  he isn t an extremist  just a run of the mill conservative in short  olbermann is right  it is time for the electoral college to stop being a rubber stamp  and to do their job  they all know that trump is unqualified  and therefore should not assume the office of the presidency watch the video below it s as if   days ago alexander hamilton saw trump coming and provided the way to stop him with hrc as the hero pic twitter com   keith olbermann   keitholbermann  december    image via frederick m  brown getty images
