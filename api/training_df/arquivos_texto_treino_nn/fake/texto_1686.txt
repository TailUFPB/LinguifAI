donald trump recently said that grading his first  days is a ridiculous standard  but as jake tapper points out  trump set the standard himself during the campaign when mitt romney ran for president in   he quickly made a name for himself as a serial flip flopper  well  donald trump is flip flopping even more throughout the  campaign  trump made a lot of promises about what he would get done during his first  days  even going so far as to present a  days action plan listing what americans could expect him to accomplish during that period but now that his first  days winding down  trump realized that he is a total failure and quickly posted a tweet designed to make it sound like the first  days standard is no big deal no matter how much i accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first  days    it has been a lot  including s c    media will kill   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    has even released a list of his so called  historic accomplishments  to make it appear like he has done great things since taking over the white house jake tapper was not impressed and it only took him four minutes to take trump down on monday night the cnn host began informing trump of his record low approval ratings and pointed out that not a single major piece of legislation has been signed despite republicans controlling congress  with historically low approval ratings and zero pieces of major legislation signed into law  president trump has had an empirically disappointing first  days  perhaps that s the reason he recently tweeted about the  ridiculous  standard of the first  days  indeed  trump often brags about himself and whines about the media when they tell the truth about him tapper then demonstrated trump s hypocrisy by showing clips of him repeatedly bragging about how much he would get done in the first  days  in other words  trump held himself to the standard that he now claims is  ridiculous  he changed his tune on this marker this very conceit that he promoted with his  day action plan   tapper continued   which is not really a surprise  because president trump often heralds his flexibility  tapper went on to hit trump for flip flopping on all of his positions during the campaign  like when he said that  nato is obsolete   only to turn around and admit that nato is not obsolete after coming face to face with nato officials  then there was the time trump dismissed the unemployment rate as  phony   which was under  percent during the campaign  only to brag about the same numbers when the first jobs reports came out under his presidency then there s healthcare  which trump bragged would be easy to deal with during the campaign  he promised americans would get cheap healthcare  now  he admits it s  complicated  after failing to repeal the popular affordable care act trump also failed to cripple a syrian air base he ordered bombed  botched a raid in yemen that left a soldier  an american girl  and many civilians dead  his two immigration bans have been blocked by the courts  and a government shutdown looms because trump refuses to budge on funding his useless border wall in the end  tapper also hit trump for complaining about executive orders during the campaign  only to sign  within his first  days  more than any president since world war ii  in fact  trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than president obama  trump is also on pace to take more vacations days  spend more taxpayer dollars on those vacation days  and play more rounds of golf here s the video via youtube donald trump is a loser  that s the one word that best sums up trump and his disastrously embarrassing first three months in office featured image  screenshot
