the nra has a new favorite toy  but there are no bullets involved   except maybe the bullet points they include in their scripts  dana loesch has transformed herself from useful fox news idiot to darling of the second amendment  and the nra is more than happy to put her stern but beautiful face on camera earlier this year  loesch and the nra put out a video recruiting ad they called  the clenched fist of truth   it accused the left of  assassinating real news  and using wedge issues like homophobia  racism  and sexism to stifle the views of conservative americans  in the video  schoolchildren are depicted on a playground just before loesch says they re being indoctrinated to believe trump is  another hitler   in short  it s disgusting  civil rights activist deray mckesson summed it up this nra ad is an open call to violence to protect white supremacy  if i made a video like this  i d be in jail  pic twitter com   deray mckesson   deray  june    the backlash was short lived  and in an environment as rich with news as the trump era  it was quickly forgotten  despite its gross  dangerous message now dana and the nra are back with a new ad  equally violent  this time aimed at the new york times  loesch carefully phrases her threats as a shot across the  proverbial  bow of the times  so as to avoid being accused of outright incitement  but the accusations in the video mirror perfectly the paranoia  suspicion  and resentment of trump fans who want to believe that news they don t like is  fake   and the final phrase in the video    we re coming for you    is as menacing as anything else the nra has done in a near derailing of the conversation  a few pundits misheard loesch s use of the word fisk  a  verb ing  of the last name of a writer considered easily debunked by right wingers who disagree with him   thinking instead that she had said  fist   if that seems like a silly thing to get hung up on  the context clears it up we re going to fisk the new york times and find out just what deep rich means to this old gray hag if you thought that said  fist   the meaning is changed considerably  their mistake wasn t just one of hearing  though   the tweet from the nra accompanying the video uses the hashtag  clenchedfistoftruth  the mistake is understandable  loesch didn t think so  she blew up at a few notable tweeters who made the error the new  orwellian video says  in part we ve had it with your constant protection of your democrat overlords  your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life somebody is confused about what s real and what s not   and it s not the new york times watch the video here   dloesch has a message for the  nytimes   we re coming for you   one non  fakenews story is not enough   nra  clenchedfistoftruth pic twitter com   nratv   nratv  august    image via alex wong getty images
