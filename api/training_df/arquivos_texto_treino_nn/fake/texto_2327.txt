donald trump took quite a bit of heat following the racist shooting in kansas city that resulted in the deaths of two indian engineers  the perpetrator shouted what sounded like trump inspired racial slurs like  get out of my country   before killing srinivas kuchibholta  who died and alok madasani  who was injured  trump took almost a week to address the shooting at all  there was also a spate of vandalism toward jewish cemeteries and for most of a week  crickets from trump trump did finally talk about the shooting and the vandalism in his address to congress on tuesday  but many say it was too little too late  after all  trump doesn t hesitate in calling out muslim terrorists  he and his people even make up terrorist attacks in an interview with cnn s alisyn camerota  trump surrogate anthony scaramucci said that the only reason trump didn t address the kansas city shooting and the string of vandalism in jewish cemeteries  was that it would cause more fear and civil unrest  he s not constantly condemning    camerota pointed out   there was silence after kansas city  he didn t tweet about it  some people felt if had it been a muslim  had it been a middle eastern gunman instead of a white gunman  he would have immediately condemned it  the president is controlling the bully pulpit and the news cycle  and he doesn t want to overly discuss the stuff because you re worried that in itself will cause a fire   he replied   you re trying to strike the right balance  you can agree with me or disagree with me  i do believe the president has consistently  and maybe not with the level of volume you d like  but he has consistently and his administration has consistently denounced these acts of violence  source  raw storyhere s the video let s see if you can follow that logic   and i ll be frank  i m having trouble with it  trump s anti muslim rhetoric  which has always flowed freely whenever he speaks or tweets  is a huge recruiting tool for isis  apparently  he doesn t care that he is causing unrest and fear toward muslims and by muslims hate crimes since the election have been up and hate groups are on the rise  the horse has left the barn as far as trump inspiring hate  but he does have the bully pulpit  if he can influence hate  he can certainly influence people not to act on their hatred  he won t  though  as more and more sane people turn against him  trump is left with a base that looks a lot like hitler s brownshirts  he doesn t want to offend his biggest supporters featured image via video screen capture
