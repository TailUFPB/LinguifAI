congress has been working on rolling back an obama era rule that protected us from having our internet histories bought  sold  and broadcast  and people are understandably upset considering the gop s ongoing pretense that privacy is everything  the rule hadn t gone into effect  but it would have given us more control over what our isps can do with our information than we currently have the gop doesn t want that rule to go into effect  and max temkin  one of the founders of the party game  cards against humanity   has made a vow that congress would be wise to heed  since temkin has an awful lot of money if this shit passes i will buy the browser history of every congressman and congressional aide and publish it  cc  speakerryan https   t co   max temkin   maxtemkin  march    s a strong   in your face  how do you like it   move  the point that temkin is trying to make here is that  if congressional republicans are willing to allow companies to buy and sell our information  compromising our privacy  then they should know exactly what that feels like  the isps and the gop both feel that this restriction was unfair  given that it wouldn t have applied to major websites like google and facebook so  of course  we should get rid of this rule instead of leveling the playing field and preventing google and facebook  and other sites  from likewise collecting and selling our data  industry groups framed their argument like so  it set out an overbroad definition of sensitive data that doesn t apply to non isp s collecting as much or more personal data online  and as we all know  privacy shouldn t be about who collects information  it should be about what information is collected and how it is used  the truth is that republicans have been getting a lot of money from the telecom industry  and they only care about privacy when it doesn t adversely affect their handlers  maybe if they re the first to have their data sold and exposed  they ll think twice about their selective brand of privacy advocacy featured image via drew angerer getty images
