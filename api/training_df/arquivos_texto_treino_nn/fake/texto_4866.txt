donald trump s republican running mate mike pence  made an appearance on cnn s state of the union saturday morning where he was grilled by the show s host  jake tapper  the grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding trump s flip flop on his proposal to forcefully deport  million undocumented immigrants the segment begins with tapper playing a clip of trump from last november where he clearly states that  we re going to have a deportation force   that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin throughout his campaign  trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals  it s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used  it implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals  from trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric  all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals  now that trump is in general election mode  they need to come up with specifics  trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base  however  he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets that s why during the interview pence insists that trump hasn t pivoted on the issue  nothing has changed about donald trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration  his position and his principles have been absolutely consistent   pence said   the choice could not be more clear for the american people  donald trump has been completely consistent in his positions  tapper doesn t buy it  he responds to pence saying  except on this issue  the one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the  or  million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard mr  trump say in that clip from november of last year  let  be clear  trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began  first  he wanted to ban muslims from entering the u s  now  he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations  he is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force  he has to  setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world  it would also cost the u s  around   billion dollars  it would also have a side effect of completely destroying the u s  economy you can watch the interview below featured image from video screen capture
