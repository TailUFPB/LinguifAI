earlier this month  the trump campaign posted on its website an advertisement seeking election observers to monitor locations  the move  which is unusual for private campaigns  comes from the irrational fear that should hillary clinton win  the election would be rigged  so trump s solution  have his rabid  conspiracy theory believing supporters intimidate voters in poll lines in pennsylvania  where polls have clinton ahead by as much as nine points  trump claims the only way clinton could win is if she cheats or those in the democratic party  rig  the election in her favor  so his initial call was to have his supporters monitor the stations in the predominantly black and minority  voting urban areas of the state it was very reminiscent of the  jim crow intimidation of the south after facing some backlash for the dangerous and archaic call to suppress and intimidate voters  trump doubled down on his claim that the election will be rigged and that supporters should  watch  the polling locations very closely on election day you ve got to get every one of your friends  you ve got to get every one of your family  you ve got to get everybody to go out and watch  and go out and vote  and when i say watch  you know what i m talking about  right  you know what i m taking about  i think you got to go out and you got to watch the question is just what should his people be watching for  should they be watching and  observing  people of color  should they be monitoring young  college aged millenials  should they be asking voters their personal information so they can play sherlock holmes once again  trump sounds his dog whistle  when he tells his predominantly white audience   you know what i m talking about   the innuendo could not be more clear  watch  intimidate and disenfranchise minority voters of course  republicans  who have been pushing the now widely debunked myth of rampant voter fraud  will be mum on this  in justification  they will point to the said myth that is rampant voter fraud as why they support this dangerous  racist and damaging call to action trump s call to intimidate voters should be a warning to all americans  don t get complacent  get out  vote  and take this monstrosity down featured image via angelo meredino getty images
