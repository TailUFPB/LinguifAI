for at least one day  donald trump did not say the stupidest thing  his housing and urban development secretary ben carson did  and he got burned by actor samuel l  jackson while delivering remarks about immigrants  carson actually had the gall to claim that slaves were immigrants  too  as if they voluntarily left their homes in africa to do back breaking work in america for free along with getting beaten and whipped and sold like livestock  that s what america is about   carson said   a land of dreams and opportunity  there were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships  worked even longer  even harder for less  but they  too  had a dream that one day their sons  daughters  grandsons  granddaughters  great granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land  seriously  carson literally thinks slaves were immigrants his stupidity immediately drew mockery from people across the country on social media  in particularly  samuel l  jackson s response was the best jackson s response was short and sweet and included his trademark profanity  and carson definitely deserved it ok   ben carson  i can t  immigrants   in the bottom of slave ships     muthafukka please    dickheadedtom  samuel l  jackson   samuelljackson  march    centuries prior to and until the civil war  slaves were kidnapped from their native lands and chained up in the bottom of super crowded slave ships where many would die of disease  once they arrived in america they were treated like livestock  sold to other people  and given new names carson and many other conservatives would have us believe that black people volunteered to be slaves but that s a complete and utter lie that goes against everything we know about slavery ben carson should be ashamed of himself and his stupidity  what he said is the same thing racists say to justify the crimes against humanity white people in this country committed  they think we did black people a favor by enslaving them  but the fact is that slavery is wrong and has been a stain on our history that will never fade  especially if people like ben carson keep spewing this revisionist history bullshit featured image via wikimedia
