a backlash has ensued after donald trump launched a war against black athletes who choose to sit rather than stand during the national anthem in protest of racial inequality and police brutality  gen  michael hayden  a retired united states air force four star general  who served in the military for  years  penned a column which savages the former reality show star over his nfl twitter tantrums  at first  hayden wasn t  enthusiastic  about throwing his support behind colin kaepernick  the former san francisco  quarterback who started the silent protest of kneeling during the anthem hayden  who served as national security adviser and head the cia after he left the military  wrote that the issues kaepernick raised  were both real and sincerely held  but then trump crossed the line when he spoke to a crowd in deep red alabama and called black athletes who kneel  sons of bitches   hayden wrote that it s  the way he has previously treated other groups like mexicans  murderers and rapists   intelligence professionals  nazis   immigrants  deeply unfair   refugees  dangerous   and muslims  they hate us   as a  year military veteran  i think i know something about the flag  the anthem  patriotism  and i think i know why we fight   he wrote   it s not to allow the president to divide us by wrapping himself in the national banner  i never imagined myself saying this before friday  but if now forced to choose in this dispute  put me down with kaepernick  trump lashes out at everyone  especially minorities in order to rile up his base  he literally loves conflict and chaos  when you elect a former reality show star to lead the most powerful country on earth  you re begging for controversy and that s what trump s base wants  trump had zero political experience for the job he seems to loathe so much and yet  here he is  trump uses his twitter account to divide the nation  and sometimes to try to start a war after trump is out of office  we re really going to have to  make america great again  but it will take years to correct all of the harm he s done to this country photo  alex wong via getty images
