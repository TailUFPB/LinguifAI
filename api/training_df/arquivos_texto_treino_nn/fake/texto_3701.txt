if there s one thing that unites working class americans of all political persuasions  it s a hatred of wall street  donald trump knows this   he campaigned on it in iowa  in fact  saying  i m really good at that stuff  i know wall street  i know the people on wall street  we re going to have the greatest negotiators of the world  but at the same time  i m not going to let wall street get away with murder  wall street has caused tremendous problems for us  we re going to tax wall street  these days  he s singing a different tune  instead of taxing them  he s cutting taxes on the rich  instead of  stopping them from getting away with murder   they re getting rid of the financial regulations that will stop another recession  and instead of standing up for consumers  he s destroying the agency that has recouped over   billion from predatory financial companies after electorally winning the election  while massively losing the popular vote     million at the time of this writing and growing   he is openly showing what many of us knew along  he doesn t give a single sh t about any of his supporters  and he will stab them in the back repeatedly and at length until somebody stops him donald trump never had any intention of raising taxes on  hedge fund guys   after all  they re in the same class of people he is  rich  and therefore better than you  why should they have to pay taxes  trump doesn t  and thinks it s smart trump s administration wants to repeal dodd frank  which is the wall street reform and consumer protection package passed after the great recession to prevent the need for another bailout at taxpayer expense  trump thinks  instead  that the banks will do better regulating themselves   much the way they did in the years leading up to the   crash  here s what trump and the gop are against an act to promote the financial stability of the united states by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system  to end  too big to fail   to protect the american taxpayer by ending bailouts  to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices  and for other purposes and it gets worse as thinkprogress reports dodd frank also created the consumer financial protection bureau  an agency focused on protecting americans from predatory and fraudulent bank behavior  it s already recouped more than   billion for those who have been targeted by such practices  the cfpb has also written new rules for mortgage lending while extending oversight to some financial firms  such as debt collectors and payday lenders  that had previously gone with little oversight that s right   donald trump wants to get rid of one of the few parts of government that consistently works on behalf of the little guy  they re also targeting seniors trump made a campaign promise to impose a moratorium on all new regulations for the financial sector  but he has already targeted existing regulations for immediate dismantling  trump adviser and hedge fund investor anthony scaramucci promised to reverse president obama s executive action to protect retirees the fiduciary duty rule  it requires all financial advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own  rather than being able to steer clients toward more expensive options that make money for themselves  that conflicted advice is estimated to cost retirees   billion a year  we ve got to get rid of this   scaramucci told the financial times  calling it  unnecessary   he had previously made this pledge while likening the rule to the  dred scott supreme court decision that denied birthright citizenship to slaves and their descendants he s giving the banks exactly what they want in fact  he seems to think that he might need them a little closer to him so that he can really serve them well  because he s actually inviting bank executives to work in his administration   certainly a far cry from his pro working class messages on the campaign trail  according to politico  his leading picks for secretary of the treasury are a goldman sachs executive and a billionaire investor the working class republicans that voted for trump are some of the people who will be most hurt by the actual policies that the trump administration wants to put into effect  you get what you vote for  republicans featured image via spencer platt getty images
