i woke up this morning completely unfazed over the idea that donald trump had yet another overnight twitter meltdown  after being skewered in the media over his repeated claims that millions of people voted illegally  which is the only reason he lost the popular vote  trump vowed to investigate i will be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud  including those registered to vote in two states  those who are illegal and    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     those registered to vote who are dead  and many for a long time   depending on results  we will strengthen up voting procedures   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    this  despite the fact that there is no voter fraud many  of course  are theorizing that trump s twitter tantrums are simply a distraction from his real disasters  and that s true  to a point  but when you dig a little deeper  you ll find something much  much more sinister  trump is declaring civil war and three things he s done over the last  hours prove it while threatening to investigate voter fraud might be  and likely is  a distraction  it s more than a threat  it s very specific  he s going after only the states that he didn t win during wednesday s white house briefing  press secretary sean spicer was asked about trump s false claim that millions of fraudulent votes cost him a victory in the popular vote  after that lie was ridiculed tuesday  trump tweeted early wednesday morning that he would order a  major investigation  into voter fraud  but the claim is not just unsupported by any evidence it was contradicted by his own campaign lawyers  who argued there was no evidence of fraud when green party nominee jill stein sued for a recount in some states  why should anyone believe him now spicer s answer was stunning  there s a lot of states that we didn t compete in where that s not necessarily the case   he said  you look at california and new york  i m not sure that those statements were we didn t look at those two states in particular   i think when you look at where a lot of places where a lot of these issues could have occurred in bigger states  that s where i think we re going to look  source  the atlanticthe second shot fired in the civil war is against sanctuary cities  or cities where undocumented immigrants can report crimes committed against them without fear of legal retribution  most of those cities  not surprisingly  are heavily democratic  trump signed an executive order that would take away federal funding from states that don t make life a living hell for undocumented immigrants  the majority of sanctuary cities are in firmly blue states  but we ll be curious to see if trump s threat will come to fruition in red states the third was on a smaller scale  but in its way  far more frightening  on tuesday night  trump quoted some bill o reilly statistics and said that he was going to  send in the feds  to deal with chicago s violence  chicago  by the way  doesn t even crack the top  in most murderous cities  if chicago doesn t fix the horrible  carnage  going on   shootings in  with  killings  up   from    i will send in the feds   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    re still unclear about what  send in the feds  actually means  but the implication is that trump intends to declare martial law and it might be over a petty feud with chicago s mayor  rahm emanuel  illinois is also a state that voted for hillary clinton in another time  republicans would be furious  what trump is threatening violates state sovereignty  no president has ever won  percent of the vote  but we ve never had a president who s threatened those who dared vote against him  we ve especially never had a president who threatened martial law over a political dispute  it s also a violation of the posse comitatus act  which forbids federal troops from acting as local police except under cases of extreme emergency  if trump does send troops into chicago  against the will of the mayor and the governor  it will clearly be an act of war featured image via drew angerer getty images
