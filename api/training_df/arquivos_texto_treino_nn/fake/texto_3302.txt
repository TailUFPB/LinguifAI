donald trump was really looking forward to using a dormant regulation as the basis for his muslim registry  while the donald planned to resurrect the bush era national entry exit registration system  nseers    a program that was condemned heavily for targeting muslims   obama decided that he might as well just eliminate it before trump can make good on his promise to bring it back on thursday  the department of homeland security published a new regulation that completely eliminates nseers  which has lain dormant since president obama suspended the program in  the department of homeland security  dhs  is removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special registration program for certain nonimmigrants  dhs ceased use of the national security entry exit registration system  nseers  program in  after finding that the program was redundant  captured data manually that was already captured through automated systems  and no longer provided an increase in security in light of dhs s evolving assessment of the threat posed to the united states by international terrorism  the regulatory structure pertaining to nseers no longer provides a discernable public benefit as the program has been rendered obsolete accordingly  dhs is removing the special registration program regulations the best part  this new rule takes effect almost immediately  so there is nothing at all trump can do to stop obama from scuttling his hopes of using nseers to create his nazi esque program this seems to be a response to a plea from new york state attorney general eric schneiderman to president obama  in a letter addressed to the president  schneiderman pointed out  very correctly   we can t risk giving president elect trump the tools to create an unconstitutional religious registry  schneiderman praised the president s decision thursday  this is a win for civil rights and for smart  effective law enforcement  as well as for the strong coalition of advocacy organizations and others who fought to dismantle this discriminatory tool   he said   my office will continue do everything it can to protect the rights of all new yorkers  and ensure equal justice under the law for all  regardless of religion or national origin  if trump wants to create a muslim registry   and he really  really does  he s going to need to find another way to do it featured image via win mcnamee getty images
