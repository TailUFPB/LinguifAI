donald trump is a small child in a  year old man s body who somehow managed to get elected president of the united states  it seems that world leaders are aware of this  and therefore are now devising methods to deal with him as such  case in point   trump s very first summit with the other member nations of the north atlantic treaty organization  nato  nato officials are well aware that trump has the attention span of a toddler who needs a nap  so they are going to keep the topics simple and make sure that any remarks are limited to two to four minute bursts  in addition to the shortened speeches and elementary subject matter  the summit will have no formal statement after the meeting with the heads of state for the  countries in the nato alliance  officials in the know say that the people involved in setting all of this up to accommodate trump s childlike ways are really scrambling  as the summit is set to commence on may   in short  they are going to trump  proof the event  from uproxx  it s kind of ridiculous how they are preparing to deal with trump   said one source briefed extensively on the meeting s preparations   it s like they re preparing to deal with a child   someone with a short attention span and mood who has no knowledge of nato  no interest in in depth policy issues  nothing   said the source  who spoke on condition of anonymity   they re freaking out  people are scared of his unpredictability  intimidated by how he might react knowing the president might speak his mind   or tweet his mind    former official said  or  as another current senior nato official put it before the meeting   we re bracing for impact  as if this isn t bad enough  a big topic of this particular meeting of the nato alliance will be how to share the costs and other burdens associated with nato  of course  we all remember how trump actually gave german chancellor angela merkel a bill for supposed monies she owes to nato on her very first visit to our country  so  there s no telling what he ll say to other member nations on this topic at the summit  this worry has not escaped the international officials preparing for this event  again  from uproxx  his views of burden sharing seem to be more ambitious than past presidents   and that could become a source of tension at the big nato confab  said alexander vershbow  former deputy secretary general of nato   the burden sharing conversation may not go entirely smoothly  this is beyond embarrassing  with each passing day  trump s childish temperament  incompetence  and buffoonery lessens america s standing in the world  when will the republicans in congress wake up  admit they made a mistake by getting this man elected  and start preparing to oust him from office only time will tell  until then   resist featured image via mark wilson getty images
