while the controversy over trump s personal tax returns continues  business credit rating company nav decided to take a look at his business  credit  and published the results on their website  nav  which actually does have an a  rating from the better business bureau  as opposed to trump u  s final rating   pulled together the factors affecting business credit scores and discovered something truly laughable the highest possible business score is   the trump organization s score is   nineteen  as in more than  but less than   and it s actually dropped  points  this puts the company in the medium to high risk category the organization is considered highly likely to default on its debts  and it averages sending payments  days late  they also have six derogatories  which can be delinquent loans that have been turned over to collections  as well as tax liens and judgments against the organization  according to nav  that last one usually means the business was the defendant in a lawsuit and is now required to pay damages to the plaintiff compare that to the clinton foundation  which has a score of    isn t great  but it s a hell of a lot better than the trump organization s  note  the clinton foundation has been around since   but has only been known in its current form for the last three years despite not having stellar credit either  the clinton foundation also has no derogatories and makes its payments on time this whole thing is laughable considering the wonderful businessman trump seems to think he is  it s even more laughable considering that trump says nobody knows debt better than he does  in august  he boasted that he has  very little debt  relative to his assets regardless of whether that s true  the fact that the trump organization s credit score is so low suggests that trump is either not nearly as good at managing what debt he does have as well as he claims  or he s not nearly as good at managing his businesses as well as he claims this credit score is hilarious featured image by scott olson via getty images
