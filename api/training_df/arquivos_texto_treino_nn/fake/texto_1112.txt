trump and his minions and cronies twist reality so badly it s amazing they can even see straight enough to write anything pretty much anywhere  yesterday  and into today  trump has been going on about being investigated and screaming about why hillary clinton and the democrats aren t  today  one of hillary s campaign accounts     decided to troll trump a little over this  their last tweet is dated nov     and it s absolutely glorious  it pokes trump over the fact that he s under investigation for obstruction of justice  and possibly for other crimes that may include collusion with russia  this is what they did     pic twitter com   the briefing     june    know the answer is yes  he s still here  unfortunately  he still has a white house full of possible russian agents  possibly including himself   he s still trying to claim that he s completely innocent and all the facts point that way  and he s still generally making a fool of himself over both his  fake news  nonsense and his smear campaign against his  enemies  two days ago  the washington post broke the story that special counsel mueller is actively investigating trump for obstruction of justice over his decision to fire james comey just as the fbi s russia investigation began escalating  trump has called the post  fake news  many times  and in his diatribe from yesterday and into today  he basically admitted that they re telling the truth about the investigation furthermore  one democratic congressman has drawn up an article of impeachment against trump as well  the charge  obstruction of justice the funny thing is that the gop keeps saying trump had no intent of impeding the fbi s investigation when he s basically admitted otherwise  paul ryan also made sorry excuses about  he didn t know  when responding to comey s testimony about his termination and his conversations with trump during the time he served as fbi director we re pretty sure most of the rest of us would get convicted and thrown in jail if we said   sorry  i didn t know   after breaking the law  because ignorance of the law generally isn t seen as a valid excuse  but trump  because he s a republican president and the republicans are desperate right now  gets away with everything yes  he s still here  we re hoping that doesn t last too much longer featured image via jason kempin and sean gallup getty images
