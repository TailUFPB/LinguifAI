thank you  president obama in   during the democratic national convention  barack obama took the stage and declared that there was no red state america  no blue state america  but a united states of america  that night  my dad told us he would be president one day then four years later  he fulfilled my dad s prophecy eight years ago  i supported hillary clinton in a contentious  bitter primary  i was ready for the first woman president  and i thought she was going to win  how could she not and a long journey for me and my country began i looked around me and saw that the comfortable life i have lived was starting to crack   along with every other american citizen  the easier life we all lived post clinton was a thing of the past the economy was collapsing  and people were suffering  uncertainty plagued every household  every employee and every employer it seemed that all hope in our great country and the foundation that held it was lost  teachers  firefighters  office workers and nurses waited for their pink slips  homeowners waited for their foreclosure notices  sick seniors dreaded their medical bills then flashed on the screen  hope and change handsome  charismatic  and dignified  the junior senator from illinois  who no one had really heard of before   entered our lives and gave us hope once more  his message shined bright with me and millions of americans   that our best days were ahead  and if we worked together and trusted one another  we would prevail  it was change we could believe in  and boy did i believe it and i believe it now more than ever as this great man prepares to leave office  even in the face of an oncoming trump administration the facts remain  the deficit has been cut by two thirds  the stock market hit its highest points in history  and still continues to grow   eleven million jobs have been created   million americans now have healthcare  and the auto industry has been saved  wages  for all races and incomes  are up for the first time in a decade  same sex marriage is the law of the land  and the pentagon has opened up its door to women in all areas of expertise in other words   this country has been changed for the better  and it was the hope and perseverance of president obama that got us here  i can see around me how much better off we are  the truth is right in front of our eyes  we don t need the facts to tell us that  but they certainly don t hurt to have in front of you during a debate  now that doesn t mean he was perfect  the tpp  the large scale use of drones  the failure to fully communicate obamacare and the need for a strong government irked me at times  but unlike left wing and right wing ideologies  i never looked for a pure president no one is perfect  and they can never govern perfectly so with absolutely no help from republicans  congressional and state  president obama never wavered in his commitment to allow the american citizen to indulge in the promise that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness we have more liberty  and i believe we are a happier nation because of him president obama inspired me to pursue my own happiness  i m a sophomore in college  currently working on a degree in political science  i hope to go to law school  specialize in constitutional law  and utilize my resources to bring change   good change   to washington d c  i m a political writer  entering my fourth year of grinding out my passion for politics on paper  all of this  all the passion  anger  hope and sense of accomplishment i have when i write and share it with the world  i owe to president obama i ve burned many bridges  ended a couple friendships  and argued with a lot of people defending president obama and his policies  i have not one regret  and i would do it all over again i came of age in the era of obama  my world view of politics and culture have been shaped  in large part  because of him  he is  as some publications put it  the most consequential president in modern america his presidency  marked with dignity and grace   not scandal   was a gift to america and her people  he showed us what a calm  collected family man from the south side of chicago could do with a little bit of hope  and yearning for change  a black man with the  funny name   as he puts it   who grew up without his father and with his white mother and grandparents  transformed the face of this nation for generations to come how profound is that i will miss his calm  cool demeanor in times of crisis  i will miss his loving  inspiring message of hope  i ll miss his family   especially michelle  a first lady who was the pinnacle of elegance thanks  president obama  my president  for helping this naive and politically inept  year old grow up into a passionate  fired up  year old  who only wants to grow and do good for his fellow man president obama  you built that  yes  we can  and yes you did featured image via the white house
