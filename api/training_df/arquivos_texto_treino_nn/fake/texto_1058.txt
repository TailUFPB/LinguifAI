representative ron simmons  r carrollton  is back at it again  this time bringing with him two anti lgbt bathroom bills to the special legislative session that will take place next month in texas in the regular session that took place  simmons introduced an anti lgbt measure that failed  unfortunately  he didn t learn from this failure as he said one of the bills will be the same yes  you read that right  one of the bills he s bringing to the table is going to be the same thing that was already shot down once speaking to the dallas morning news  simmons said   i am going to file two versions  one that just does schools and one that does political subdivisions  he added that it will be filed  within minutes  of the session starting i m still scratching my head as to why people are so worked up over who uses which toilet and why  you re not going to see the person   they re behind a closed door  and to impose restricting laws on children  children sadly  simmons is not alone in this endeavor  as the governor of texas greg abbot has said that passing an anti lgbt bathroom bill is  top priority  back in may according to pinknews pinknews reports that in response to the failure to pass the bill  the state s governor has earlier this month vowed to hold a special legislative session on the issue   an extremely costly procedure which is intended to only be used for urgent issues and emergency legislation so  texas is holding a costly  special   emergency  legislative session because they re freaking out over who uses which bathroom  you know  that private place where you re meant to do your business behind closed doors  they re freaking out over which bathroom a child uses in school  just let all that sink in in response  sarah kate ellis  president  and ceo of glaad said  governor greg abbott is proving everything is bigger in texas including prioritizing discrimination  if the governor moves forward with this harmful legislation against trans students  lgbtq people  businesses  and fair minded texans will respond in texas style   big  trans texans have experienced harassment and threats because of this last session and if any anti trans bills get signed into law  then governor abbott s legacy will be turning texas into a state known for harming some its most marginalized people  source  pinknewsellis couldn t be more right  these texan lawmakers need to get a grip and focus on actual  important issues  not where someone goes to the bathroom and why  this shouldn t even be up for discussion or debate featured image via sara d  davis getty images
