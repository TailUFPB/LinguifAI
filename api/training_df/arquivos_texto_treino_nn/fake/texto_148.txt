who knew that rick perry would come up with an idea for stopping sexual assault  he no doubt thinks he s absolutely brilliant because his idea is fossil fuels  yes  he thinks fossil fuels can help stop the problems with massive rape in developing countries  but while he thinks he s shining a light on an amazingly novel idea  he s really being insanely offensive to all the victims of rape in the world  here s how he managed to combine fossil fuels with sexual assault  but also from the standpoint of sexual assault  when the lights are on  when you have light that shines  the righteousness  if you will  on those types of acts  so from the standpoint of how you really affect people s lives  fossil fuels is going to play a role in that  i happen to think it s going to play a positive role  well gee  so sorry you were raped but your village doesn t have electricity yet  that totally would have stopped it  does he not know that they already have ways to light their dwellings and their villages  we won t even ask whether he understands what rape is and why it happens   it s clear he thinks it s only a violent act that happens in darkness that s not just offensive to rape victims in the developing world  it s offensive to all rape victims everywhere  but rick perry hails from the crowd that blames women for sexual assault and harassment  it wouldn t be surprising to find that he thinks keeping lights on will stop the rape gangs in south africa and elsewhere there s also the fact that perry doesn t believe that fossil fuels are responsible for accelerating climate change  so of course he s going to put his ignorance on display like this  to that  we say  go home  perry  you are disgusting featured image via kevin dietsch pool getty images
