this woman is insane in an incredibly disrespectful rant against president obama and anyone else who supports investigating russian interference in our election  fox news host jeanine pirro said that anybody who is against donald trump is anti american  look  it s time to take sides   she began   the election is over  you re either with us or against us  that is  with the united states or against the united states  as you may recall  president bush and conservatives used this same phrase often to question the patriotism of americans who opposed war in iraq  we have a new president elect  his name is donald j  trump  so move over barack   pirro continued  going on to refer to hillary clinton and other democrats as  namby pamby pathetic losers  pirro then made a bullshit claim  there was a time in this country when we were united behind the flag in celebration of america s new president  our new leader  we all did in  when barack obama was elected  we had high hopes for a united country  irrespective of our politics  it s time for the left  assuming they re capable  to show the same dignity and class  to the  president elect  when president obama took office in   republicans vowed to make him and america fail  they obstructed at every turn  called him every name in the book  and disrespected him  they even declared their love and allegiance to foreign leaders like putin and benjamin netanyahu  so pirro is a damned liar for daring to claim that republicans united behind president obama because they absolutely did not  republican leaders had a meeting before he was even in office and agreed to block him at every turn and make him a  one term president  then pirro suggested that investigating russia for interfering with our election is also un american  you know  because america somehow has a long tradition of letting russia rig the election for the presidential candidate they prefer  this isn t about the election  is it mr  president   she asked   this is about domestic politics  it s not about november   it s about january  and your attempt to prevent donald trump from the smooth transition of power and your inability to face the overwhelming electoral college win that the american people gave him  except trump s supposed  victory  was not even close to being  overwhelming   he lost the popular vote by nearly  million votes and his electoral college margin is one of the smallest in the last  years  even president obama s victories in  and  were bigger  so in anyone had a mandate to lead  it was obama  and republicans worked to sabotage him pirro demanded to know why everyone is  so obsessed with russia  and claimed that she would rather sympathize with putin because he s supposedly a  christian   yeah  a  christian  who murders political opponents and denies his people basic human rights  i despise all dictators   she claimed   but between the dictator that thinks i m an infidel and wants to have our heads cut off and the dictator from whom i simply want to keep my distance  the choice is a no brainer  here s the video via youtube in other words  like other crazy republicans  pirro loves putin and has no problem with russia rigging our election as long as they rig it in favor of the conservative candidate  that s a dangerous path that could lead to republicans seeking help from foreign powers to help them win elections in the future  and the only way we can stop it is to investigate and if russia did help trump win  he should be disqualified immediately and we should either hold a new election or install hillary clinton as the rightful winner featured image via screenshot
