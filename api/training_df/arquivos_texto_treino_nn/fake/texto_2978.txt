there s one thing that trump s surrogates all share  and that s a ridiculously blind loyalty to trump  they can t see his evils  and their minds automatically twist any evil he says or does into something good such was the case on cnn  where rick santorum spoke up on trump s trashing of civil rights icon john lewis  who is also a democratic representative from georgia  and who said trump is an illegitimate president trump has taken a lot of flak  especially given that he did it so close to martin luther king  jr  s birthday  former presidential adviser david gergen was talking about why trump was wrong to go after lewis the way he did  this was an attack on  life  what he stands for  what he did for this country and marching across that bridge  then former philadelphia mayor michael nutter weighed in with  when will the person who will be president act like a grownup and serious person  not always take the bait  show some restraint  show some dignity  there is no bottom to the depth that he will go to argue with anyone  and cause disdain  donald trump was wrong  john lewis is an icon  he can say whatever he wants  when santorum got a chance to speak  he said he and most other people in politics would have handled lewis  comments much differently  then he put forth this obscene gem  donald trump is the president because he did things like this  which just speaks to how low trump s voters really are  if anyone can defend trump s pettiness that way  or in any way  they are just as ridiculous as he is watch the fireworks below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
