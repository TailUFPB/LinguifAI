donald trump has been playing games with his tax returns ever since he began his disgraceful presidential campaign  he repeatedly promised to release his tax returns after the election  but has continued to keep them a secret from the american people  democrats and republicans alike know that the american people deserve transparency from their president  and the latest effort to make trump reveal his tax documents is going to send him into a rage two house republicans have just joined a democratic effort to obtain copies of trump s tax returns  with the help of the internal revenue service  this is big news   and proves that not even the gop approves of the way trump has conducted himself the two republicans  reps  mark sanford  r s c   and walter jones  r n c    have added their signatures to a letter requesting trump s tax returns from the past ten years  this letter was championed by rep  bill pascrell  d n j    and backed by almost every person in the  member house democratic caucus  in the letter  it is stated that trump s tax returns would provide clarity on his conflicts of interest  which trump has tried to hide and distract from  the letter says  disclosure would serve the public interest of clarifying president trump s conflicts of interest in office  the potential for him to personally benefit from tax reform  and ensure that he is not receiving any preferential treatment from the irs we believe the powerful and respected committees on finance and ways and means have the responsibility to ensure oversight of the executive branch by requesting a review of president trump s tax returns and moving toward a formal release of these documents to the public  trump s refusal to reveal his tax returns is unusual  breaking four decades in which every presidential nominee has been transparent with their tax returns  trump tried to use an irs audit to excuse himself  but even the irs stated he was free to release his documents whenever he wanted to  hopefully  this letter and the republican senators  signatures will add enough pressure to the situation so americans can finally know the truth about trump featured image via drew angerer   getty images
