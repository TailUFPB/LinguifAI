when people talk about the threat that donald trump poses to the u s   they generally talk about things like education  the environment  consumers  workers  immigrants  minorities  and so on  his  make america great again  slogan is nothing more than hot air  and anybody who s been paying attention knows it  but there s one absolutely vital government function that trump threatens that nobody s talking about  it s a safe bet that most of us actually haven t even thought of it  despite his warning to federal agencies to prepare for massive budget cuts it s the u s  census  and the census is something we need  population counts determine the number of u s  representatives a state gets  and they also determine how the states  districts get redrawn  even states with independent commissions depend on the census to know how best to draw district lines census data is also used for federal programs affecting things like education  veterans  services  rural development  transportation  housing and more  the census determines the allocation of funding for the following and so much more  including in the private sector   businesses can use census data to determine everything from optimal location to understanding both the local labor force and the local consumer population  of course  most of this is stuff that the trump administration and the republican party see as wastes anyway  but they ll be hard pressed to actually cut funding for all of this in a budget without facing massive backlash hmm  now that we re thinking about it  maybe sabotaging the census would be their way of gutting all these programs that list  while a ton  isn t all  there s also what trump s stance on immigration could do  ice has been sweeping cities for undocumented immigrants  even targeting courthouses as immigrants show up for hearings and appointments about pretty much everything  in fact  a judge in washington state reported hearing that undocumented immigrants are missing court dates  even if they were seeking a protective order against an abuser we have the growing hate and fear of muslims to contend with  too   while they aren t being arrested and deported  yet   they could worry that answering the census will expose sensitive information and make them more vulnerable to harassment and attack for these reasons  immigrants and other minorities may find themselves far less willing to participate in the  census  and in communities that have high immigrant and or minority populations  that could result in bad undercounts  undercounts that are bad enough could result in districts  especially those that are done by independent commissions  being inadvertently redrawn in ways that don t accurately represent the states  populations it could also result in impoverished  high immigrant communities seeing necessary federal dollars drain away from programs they depend on now  okay  the census is still three years away  but trump s funding cuts have already forced them to scrap plans for some new field offices that would help the census go more smoothly  and has also forced them to cancel the dry runs they do every decade in the run up to the actual census  that tells us that just conducting the  census is very likely to be problematic they re asking us to do it online this year  partly as a cost cutting measure  because of course   which raises cybersecurity concerns and could exacerbate immigrants  and minorities  fears of having ice come knock at their door  or having asshat racists attack and or harass them  following hacks courtesy of everyone from russia to the shadow brokers  who recently hacked the nsa   they re going to have one hell of a time convincing us that our data will be safe and secure the problems trump and the gop are causing for the census are nothing to shrug at  so much of the way this country is run depends on an accurate census count  and they re going to have a really difficult time featured image by mark wilson via getty images
