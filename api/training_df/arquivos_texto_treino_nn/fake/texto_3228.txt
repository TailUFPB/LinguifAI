donald trump and his deplorable supporters are going to lose their shit when they hear about this since   mama ayesha s restaurant has served middle eastern cuisine in washington d c  in the same spot  since   it has been the home of a special presidential mural featuring ayesha standing in unison with the last ten presidents  including president obama  this is mama welcoming the presidents to dc   her great nephew abu el hawa told the washingtonian about the painting   she was the american dream  for a muslim and arab woman immigrant from palestine to come here on her own and build this business  is a remarkable legacy  the painting was commissioned in  and supported by the dc commission on the arts and humanities and was completed by artist karla  karlisima  rodas  an immigrant from el salvador but donald trump will not be joining the ten presidents on the mural  and that s a good thing when ayesha passed away in   she left the famous restaurant to her nephew  who is citing budgetary reasons for declining to add trump to the mural  our official position is that it is not in the budget   abu el hawa stated in other words  trump can go f ck himself donald trump does not deserve to be recognized in a mural that celebrates diversity  mama ayesha is a palestinian woman linking arms with ten presidents  one of whom is the first african american president  it would also be insulting to president obama since trump would be shown linking arms with him and that just does not jive well considering trump is a racist divider who panders to white supremacists and wants to ban muslims from the country  which would be an insult to ayesha here s a look at the mural via youtube the mural serves as  washington dc s largest postcard  and it s safe to say that trump is not someone who will make people want to visit our nation s capital cue the temper tantrum from trump and his supporters in    featured image via drew angerer getty images
