last night  the new york times ran a story that s a potential bombshell for poor  put upon donald trump   he declared a   million loss on his taxes in   which means he potentially didn t pay any income tax for the following  years  today  everyone is buzzing about it on all the tv shows  and chris christie takes the cake for most implausible spin to make trump look good for this while speaking to fox host chris wallace on fox news sunday  christie called this a good story for trump because it not only highlights all the flaws in the tax code  but it also shows trump to be the extremely intelligent  honest  dependable  law and order candidate he claims he is wallace came back  absolutely stunned by that  and said  wait  wait wait  you re saying it s a good story for donald trump that he failed to pay any federal income taxes   first of all  that he took a billion dollar loss   and that he failed to pay any federal income taxes for years  that s a good story  of course it is  christie insists  there s nothing illegal about what trump did  he also has a fiduciary duty to his shareholders to pay as little tax as possible  so obviously it s okay  besides  we don t know that trump didn t pay any income taxes for that long  although knowing him  he really didn t  watch wallace s sheer astonishment below there s a reason that this isn t okay  even though it s legal  and it s because trump not only brags incessantly about paying as little tax as possible  but he also said that doing so makes him smart  legal and smart do not mean right  and for a presidential candidate who constantly gripes about our veterans not getting cared for  and our infrastructure crumbling  he cannot go around bragging about how he s paid little to no income tax especially when things like veterans  benefits and infrastructure have been crumbling because the little guy s been shouldering a lot of the tax burden in this country  while the wealthy and corporations get away with paying far less than their fair share  trump s essentially bragging that he s gotten around  and gotten away with  something the rest of us do faithfully every year  whether we like it or not all this actually does is show trump for the selfish  narcissistic hypocrite he is  chris christie is a brown nosed bootkisser  though  and he seems to be learning spin from the worst elements at places like breitbart and fox news featured image via screen capture from embedded video
