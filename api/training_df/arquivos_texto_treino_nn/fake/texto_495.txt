imagine for a moment that your job was to scour the media  searching for the rare news report that puts a positive spin on donald trump and his disastrous escapades in the white house  for one rnc staffer  this was the day to day reality he faced every morning when he clocked into work  after hanging on for several months  andy hemming finally decided he couldn t take it any longer and resigned  you can hardly blame the guy and have to ask  how did he stay on this sinking ship as long as he did according to politico  hemming handed in his resignation on monday  previously  the publication had written a profile on hemming which referred to him as the staffer the white house pays     a year to spot and distribute positive stories from the mainstream media  hemming was senior adviser for research at the rnc in the  cycle and director of research on the trump campaign  at the white house  he worked from   a m  to  p m  every weekday and was a regular in reporters  inboxes  blasting out stories favorable to the administration hemming has not yet commented on his decision to leave the position  but white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said that it was a  utual decision that he could best help promote the president s agenda on the outside  andy is smart and very talented and we wish him all the best  all administrations have people dedicated to finding and spreading news stories that show the president in a good light  but performing these duties with trump at the helm was no doubt a unique experience  there surely isn t much positive media coverage on him these days because  in addition to being a raging bigot  he continually manages to screw up even the simplest of tasks  like not frying his retinas while watching the eclipse   how hemming kept from completely losing his mind long before now is anybody s guess featured image via chris kleponis pool getty images
