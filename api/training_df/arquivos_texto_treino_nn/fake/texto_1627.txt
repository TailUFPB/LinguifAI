ohio governor and former republican presidential candidate john kasich is the one gop elected official that is still not on the trump train  the other party loyalists have fallen in line  with the occasional criticisms from folks like senator lindsey graham  r sc  and senator john mccain  r az   infamously  gov  kasich did not attend the republican national convention even though it was in his home state and he was the sitting governor  he also refused to praise or endorse trump  or demand that others in his party do so  now  it seems he may be looking at a way to take his party back from the donald in  gov  kasich s gubernatorial term will end in   due to term limits  therefore  he also will be looking to see what his next project will be  for now  he has been touring the talk show circuit promoting a book  and that has been the focus of these conversations  however  a man who was once an aide to  gop nominee mitt romney  ryan williams  says of kasich s  prospects  kasich is kind of in limbo   his time as governor will end when he s termed out  he doesn t have a path toward any other office in ohio  and if trump runs for reelection  i doubt he ll challenge him  that  however  does not mean that kasich won t be throwing his hat into the  ring  williams goes on to say  but he s trying to keep his name in the mix in case president trump decides not to run again   he  like many people  was counting on president trump to lose in november  expecting to occupy a space in the effort to rebuild the party  but that evaporated the minute trump won the election  still  though  kasich remains skeptical of trump as president  and refuses to rule out challenging trump  when asked  he ducks the question and essentially says he isn t running right now  he is promoting his book in short  it seems that kasich knows that trump is terrible for the country  and really has no loyalty to the man  further  with trump s increasingly divisive policies and rhetoric continuing to rip at the fabric of the nation  he may feel the obligation to do what he can to unseat trump in the primary and deny him the nomination a second time  in fact  when asked  kasich said  what i m saying is it s unlikely  but i don t know what the future is going to bring for me  or what responsibility or obligation i might feel  the more trump rips the nation apart  something tells me that obligation will feel a lot stronger by the time  rolls around if trump isn t impeached first featured image via mark wilson getty images
