guess who george h w  bush is voting for  he lost to bill clinton in   and his son is george w  bush  yet it seems that the elder bush finds trump so distasteful a candidate that he s actually going to cast his vote for hillary clinton according to politico  bush sr  had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election  considering the fact that he s a republican  and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the republicans  chosen candidate  this is actually pretty major  but it wasn t bush himself who revealed his vote  it was kathleen kennedy townsend daughter of the late robert kennedy who let this particular interesting tidbit slip  on monday  townsend posted a picture on her facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption   the president told me he s voting for hillary    she stood by that later on when talking to politico  according to her  george h w  bush would rather vote for his former rival and successor s wife than the god awful train wreck that is donald trump a spokesman for the bush family refused to actually confirm this   he said that george h w  s vote is a private decision and will remain so  he himself isn t commenting  but it seems that those who are in his inner circle aren t being so tight lipped  if kennedy is to be believed bush sr  did make it clear back in may that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing trump  that s a bold  but wise  move for any republican  since republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism his love of russian president vladimir putin would suggest that he s also on the side of autocracy  none of these three things meshes with the democracy republicans say we ve built in even the smallest way earlier in the summer  an administration official for george w  bush announced that she would vote for hillary  adding her name to an ever growing list of republicans and conservatives who can t find it within themselves to support trump  jeb bush has said he can neither vote for hillary nor trump a former republican president refusing to stand for the current republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed featured image by scott halleran getty images
