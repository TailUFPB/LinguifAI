donald trump has a major issue with sen  elizabeth warren  d ma   this was apparent during his entire presidential campaign  when he basically had a meltdown every time warren dared to criticize him or call him out on his bullsh t  trump had every reason to fear warren   she was one of his most outspoken critics  and it made americans love and respect her even more  she has a huge following and was highly influential in her role in the anti trump movement  so it was surprising to many that she attended trump s inauguration  but now  we know why she went several democrats couldn t bear to see trump get sworn in  and we can t blame them  warren  however  made it a point to show up despite the fact that trump insulted her many times  nicknaming her  pocahontas   on bill maher s real time  warren told maher just what she was thinking by going to an inauguration that she clearly did not want to see happen  she said  i went to trump s inauguration  i watched  i wanted to see it  i wanted it burned into my eyes  my view on this was that if there were ever going to be a moment when i was like   uhh  i m too tired to get up   all i ve got to do is close my eyes and i m like   oh god  i m up  i m up  i m up  i m ready  i m back in the fight  warren shared the sentiments of most americans when she said that the day after trump s inauguration was when  the world changed    but she encouraged americans to stay positive  while trump had been sworn in  the historic women s march also took place that weekend  warren said that trump s election helped americans find their voices and passion  it will be about the day we made our voices heard  it s clear that watching trump s inauguration helped light a fire inside warren  and she s using it as fuel to keep fighting trump and the gop  this is going to terrify trump  and she knows it  you can watch warren speak about the inauguration below featured image via alex wong and chip somodevilla   getty images
