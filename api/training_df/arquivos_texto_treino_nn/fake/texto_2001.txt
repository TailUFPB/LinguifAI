cnn is reporting that trump s disgraced national security adviser  gen  michael flynn  may be the key to blowing apart the russia scandal  three of four key people  including carter page  roger stone and paul manafort  who have their own suspicious ties to russia  have volunteered to speak to the house intelligence committee  but we haven t heard from flynn recently  cnn s sources explain why  it is starting to look like  from my sources and then also from open reporting  that mike flynn is the one who may have a deal with the fbi  and that s why we have not heard from him for some time  it sounds somewhat uncertain and it is right now  however  seth abramson  who s an attorney and also a professor at the university of new hampshire  broke it down this way    first  as an attorney i want to make clear that  if this  cnn analyst s sources are correct  the  russiagate scandal is blown wide open   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      the fbi flips witnesses  turning them into cooperating individuals  only when they can help secure conviction of a bigger  target   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      michael flynn was the national security adviser for the president of the united states  the only bigger target is donald j  trump   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      but flynn also held a clandestine meeting with russian ambassador spy sergey kislyak and trump son in law jared kushner in december     seth abramson   sethabramson  march      and flynn coordinated with infamous iran contra figure and russian oil gas pipeline advocate bud mcfarlane in hiring trump s deputy nsa   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      and of course flynn had the highest possible clearance and greatest possible access to potus in discussing matters of national security   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      flynn s hire as nsa was controversial even suspicious when it was made due to flynn s absolutely terrible reputation in washington   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      this suggests the hire wasn t based on merit  but rather the fact that flynn is known to have ties  in person ties  to vladimir putin   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      we should conclude from the foregoing that flynn was in the best position of anyone involved in  russiagate to see all its contours   seth abramson   sethabramson  march      given all of the above  we can say that if any one person could bring down trump due to  russiagate  it s the man the fbi may now have  pic twitter com slwjbtvtcf  seth abramson   sethabramson  march    are reports that flynn s spokesperson has said that flynn will neither confirm nor deny whether he s cooperating with the fbi at this time this is a developing story that s worth keeping an eye on  because this scandal is snowballing as more information comes out  should cnn s story come to pass  then everyone involved  including trump  will be in a world of shit even devin nunes  who keeps insisting that finding the leakers is mre important than getting to the bottom of the scandal  won t be able to maintain his position featured image by kevin hagen via getty images
