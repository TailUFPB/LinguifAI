nothing betrays your official narrative that your administration is functionally well and you are not a crook like tweeting assurances from fox news that your chances of being impeached are only slim  one might argue that frantically insisting that you are probably not going to get impeached only makes the notion that you probably are all the more reasonable  no sane president would get caught doing something so desperate but trump woke up and did just that in another humdinger to add to a series of self owns  trump retweeted a video of fox news host geraldo rivera insisting that trump s chances of being impeached went from   percent   a number he pulled out of thin air  to   percent   another number he pulled out of thin air   in doing so  trump inadvertently acknowledged that his chances of being impeached weren t zero before and are only zero now if you listen to the network that operates as state media for his administration trump s self incrimination is a nice reminder of how troubled his administration is  in an effort to spin the testimony of the former fbi director he recently inappropriately fired  he is reduced to leaning on fox news to make the case that the hearing didn t prove he was trying to obstruct justice  as most neutral observers noted  but actually it  vindicates  him   somehow  it s a line of spin so patently absurd that even conservative pundits are having a hard time trumpeting it with a straight face enter rivera  the longtime shockjock is  of course  among the least reputable men in journalism  his legendary fails include botching the opening of al capone s vault on live television  getting kicked out of iraq after revealing u s  troop positions to the enemy on live television  and saying travyon martin brought his murder on himself for wearing a hoodie   on live television  put rivera in front of a camera  broadcast it live  and chances are he will do something to humiliate himself  he has become one of trump s biggest defenders it says something about trump s chances of making it through his first term without being thrown out of office that he s just a few months in and already he s been reduced to using disreputable fox hosts like rivera to defend him  the fact that nobody else will risk destroying their reputation to stand up for him speaks volumes  luckily  trump is just dimwitted enough to keep reminding us of his precarious situation because he is fundamentally incapable of not tweeting incredibly stupid things each day featured image via michael reynolds pool getty images
