in any other administration  this would be absolute gold  every opposition player hopes to find some evidence of a politician acting like a complete jackass at some time in the past  they can use it in campaign ads  or even better  to keep someone from getting elected in the first place  that s not how it works with donald trump  though much like greg gianforte  the montana congressman whose base turned out to elect him even better after he assaulted a reporter  donald trump was elected by people who wanted an asshole  after all  this is the man who famously claimed he could  stand in the middle of  avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldn t lose voters   his voters have never proved him wrong on that  he has consistently been just one of the worst humans ever to walk the planet in every way  and his base is still as fervent as the day they vaulted their racist  sexist  xenophobic  homophobic asshole into power this video is not for them  though  this is just for us  they d probably claim this video is doctored  anyway   fake news   they might say it s not  of course two dozen years ago  donald trump the plain old very rich citizen found himself in front of a house subcommittee on resources  he was testifying that the mafia  with whom trump has some experience  was all over the casinos that were supposed to be run by native americans  the man he s speaking directly to in this video is george miller  an absolute powerhouse in congress for four decades  consistently one of the most liberal members of the house of representatives  in short  george miller has no time for trump s racist tirade is it foreshadowing   maybe we say politically correct  maybe we don t   trump was definitely showing shades of his racist father at that point  and a preview of just how little he cares for being a good person  but the way miller shuts him down is legendary go ahead  watch it again  i won t tell anyone featured image via video screen capture
