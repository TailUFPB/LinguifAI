donald trump hates losing  not because it s a loss to his agenda  or a perceived loss to the american people  trump hates losing because it hurt his paper thin ego and when he does lose  there s hell to pay  or at least threatened hell to pay   trump suffered another major loss in court after a  circuit court judge ruled against his attempt at defundng sanctuary cities  now  like a true dictator  trump wants to break up the  circuit in an interview with the washington examiner  trump said about breaking up the court  absolutely  i have   trump said of considering  circuit breakup proposals during a far ranging interview with the washington examiner at the white house   there are many people that want to break up the  circuit  it s outrageous  he then accused liberal plaintiffs of court shopping for a more sympathetic body  everybody immediately runs to the  circuit  and we have a big country  we have lots of other locations  but they immediately run to the  circuit  because they know that s like  semi automatic   trump said the  circuit  which covers nine western states and guam  is based in san francisco  san francisco is  of course  one of the sanctuary cities  so plaintiffs didn t have go far to land on their docket while the  has had some liberal rulings covering a huge swath of territory   nine western states plus guam   the san francisco based court handles far more cases than any other federal appeals court  including some rulings that have invoked furor from conservatives over the years  among them  finding that the phrase  under god  in the pledge of allegiance is unconstitutional  that the  don t ask  don t tell  policy on gays in the military was problematic long before president barack obama s administration ended it  and that states can force pharmacies to dispense emergency contraceptives source  mercury newsthey are far more balanced than right wingers would let on but some legal scholars say the  circuit s liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of president jimmy carter s appointees   who were considered extremely liberal   have taken semi retired  senior  status or passed away  a democratic congress nearly doubled the number of judges on the court during carter s tenure  and his appointees faced easy confirmation in the senate president george w  bush appointed six of the court s  active judges  but  have been appointed by democrats  though the seven appointed by president barack obama are generally considered moderate  said university of richmond law school professor carl tobias still  conservatives  and especially trump  would like nothing more than to make california even less relevant in national politics  a vote in california is worth less than   of a vote in wyoming  the bigger picture behind trump s threat is far more disturbing  we have three  supposedly  co equal branches of government  trump is trying to use his executive powers to shut down any dissenting views  even from another branch  even if you are a trump voter  you should find this very disconcerting featured image via mark wilson getty images
