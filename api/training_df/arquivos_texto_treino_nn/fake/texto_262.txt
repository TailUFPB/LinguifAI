donald trump flew into an uncontrollable rage on wednesday morning upon returning back to the mainland from hurricane ravaged puerto rico  trump apparently noticed the accurate coverage of his trip  during that trip  trump complained about how the disaster is hurting his budget plan and told puerto ricans that their catastrophe wasn t a  real catastrophe  and then he threw paper towels to victims as if they were animals of course  trump thinks this is all  fake news  because the media didn t make it look like his trip went well a great day in puerto rico yesterday  while some of the news coverage is fake  most showed great warmth and friendship   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     so many fake news stories today  no matter what i do or say  they will not write or speak truth  the fake news media is out of control   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    response to the disaster was slow  that s a fact  it s also a fact that the death toll has doubled since he told the people in puerto rico that they  should be proud  that only  people died and the media captured trump s remarks and actions on film for everyone to see but then trump attacked nbc for reporting that secretary of state rex tillerson called trump a  moron  during a pentagon meeting and threatened to resign nbc news is  fakenews and more dishonest than even cnn  they are a disgrace to good reporting  no wonder their news ratings are way down   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     nbcnews story has just been totally refuted by sec  tillerson and  vp pence  it is  fakenews  they should issue an apology to america   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    because the subject of a story denies the report  it doesn t mean the network should retract the story and apologize  news agencies have their sources and they are not going to issue a retraction just because trump tells them to do so furthermore  trump and his team have lied more than any administration in american history  including the nixon administration their word against that of the three officials who confirmed the story to nbc is meaningless it should also be pointed out that tillerson did not outright deny that he called trump a  moron  featured image  david becker getty images
