while there was certainly a left wing populist wave during the  election that propelled senator bernie sanders much further during the primary season than anyone could have imagined  it seems that this was not the big middle finger to the democratic establishment that people thought  despite four losses in special elections to replace members of congress that went to work in trump s cabinet from deep red districts  it seems that the democratic base is not ready to give up on our current leader in the house of representatives  nancy pelosi this comes after a wave of democratic members of congress have floated the idea of getting rid of pelosi in favor of fresh blood  members of the house democratic caucus like tim ryan  d oh  have been calling for leader pelosi s head after the loss of the great democratic hope in trump country  jon ossoff of georgia s  district  however  a new poll shows that fewer than three in ten democratic voters want pelosi going anywhere the poll is recent   conducted between june  and june   polling   self identified rank and file democrats  this is smart  because we need a strong  experienced leader to resist the trump agenda in congress  pelosi can fundraise and whip votes like no other  this is not the time to rip ourselves to shreds out of fear of every candidate we run being painted as a clone of nancy pelosi  remember  they ll do that to any democrat  their best weapon is to have us infighting and tearing one another down there really isn t a whole lot of daylight policy wise between the progressive populist wing and the supposed center left  in fact  while in the senate together  bernie sanders and hillary clinton voted together more than   of the time  further  by the time the platform for the  democratic party was done  bernie and hillary were about   in lockstep in short  democrats  the  election is over  stop blaming one another  and especially stop going after nancy pelosi  we need her right now  and we need everyone to be on board  lest we wind up with eight years of a hard to reverse trump pence ryan mcconnell agenda featured image via win mcnamee getty images
