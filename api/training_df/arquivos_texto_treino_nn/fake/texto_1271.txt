trump spent his second day having a mental breakdown on twitter with no signs of stopping  situations around the world are at a particularly dire moment   the middle east on the brink of war  the terror attack in london  a major infrastructure bill being drawn up   but trump woke up and immediately turned on the fox news morning entertainment show  fox and friends  instead of getting his morning intelligence briefing  he live tweeted incoherently about whatever subjects the fox hosts brought up first trump s muslim ban then how democrats are  obstructing  his ambassadorship picks   fact check  they aren t  trump has nominated almost no one and most spots remain vacant due to his inaction    foxandfriends dems are taking forever to approve my people  including ambassadors  they are nothing but obstructionists  want approvals   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     he once again viciously lashed out at the mayor of london sadiq khan  taking his original lie and adding even more lies on top to smear the british politician pathetic excuse by london mayor sadiq khan who had to think fast on his  no reason to be alarmed  statement  msm is working hard to sell it   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    mayor s  no reason to be alarmed  quote comes from a larger message where he told british citizens that they would be seeing an increased police presence and that the number of cops was  no reason to be alarmed   trump stripped the context and pretended the mayor was saying that terror attacks were no reason to be alarmed  trump said that because on fox and friends yesterday a guest made a similar claim  he either hasn t been corrected about the false information he learned on fox news or doesn t care trump did all of this while a mass shooting in orlando unfolded  unlike the terror attack in london  this one was a workplace dispute and done with a gun  five people died five people were killed in a shooting at fiamma  a business on north forsyth road near hanging moss road near orlando  the orange county sheriff s office reported this morning  calling it a  tragic incident  the shooter   a former  disgruntled employee  who was fired in april   then killed himself  shooter  orange county sheriff jerry demings said  the shooter had previously been accused of battering a fellow employee trump  who needs reasons to justify his muslim ban  doesn t seem to care much about mass shootings that don t fit the narrative that only scary islamic terrorists are capable of violence  his silence on the shooting speaks volumes  it was also in stark contrast to his earlier response to london when a tragedy hit london  he quickly retweeted an unsubstantiated claim made by right wing conspiracy site  the drudge report  he then spent the night and next morning going on a rant about muslims  he urged people in england to be scared  doing the work of the terrorists for them in contrast  when a nearly equal number of americans die in a way that is painfully normal for the country with a major gun violence problem  trump can t be bothered to even offer condolences  but then  fox and friends  which also hates to acknowledge gun violence  probably didn t mention the shooting so how would our president ever know about it featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
