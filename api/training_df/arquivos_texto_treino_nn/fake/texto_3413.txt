this morning  cnn host chris cuomo found himself trying to reason with a complete idiot when he had the unfortunate experience of having donald trump adviser anthony scaramucci on his show new day the interview didn t take long to derail as scaramucci continued to dispute climate change and the scientific community s  overwhelming consensus  that  man s actions have an impact on science  scaramucci told cuomo  chris  there was an overwhelming science that the earth was flat  cuomo was completely dumbfounded and said  it s called ignorance  you learn over time   he continued  i just want you to understand  it s not ideological for me  i m just stating to you what the proposition is from the scientific community  scaramucci replied  but it isn t for me either  cuomo continued to be baffled by scaramucci s stupidity and denial of facts  he fired back  but you don t accept the science  scaramucci continued to argue with cuomo and the rest of the scientific community  he said   thats not what i said  i said i m not certain about it  you can watch cuomo try to talk some sense into the trump advisor   with no success   below cuomo was pretty much talking to a wall during this exchange  and he might have been expecting too much from one of trump s henchmen  after all  trump s entire team has spent its campaign denying facts and spreading falsehoods meanwhile  nasa s website clearly states that climate change is a real  indisputable thing that has been measured and is happening  the site says  multiple studies published in peer reviewed scientific journals show that  percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree  and this information has been documented and available for years  in   the american association for the advancement of science wrote   the scientific evidence is clear  global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now  and it is a growing threat to society  but don t expect any of trump s minions to do any research   not even a simple google search  they re just like trump   completely removed from reality featured image via screenshot
