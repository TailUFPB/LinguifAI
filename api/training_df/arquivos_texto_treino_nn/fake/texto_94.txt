clearly  trump supporters want fox news to lie to them because when fox news host shep smith fact checked donald trump s accusations against hillary clinton in regards to the uranium one deal with russia  they lost their shit smith thoroughly debunked republican claims that hillary clinton approved the deal in a pay to play scam during her time as secretary of state back in  first  the deal had to be approved by a committee of nine agency heads  who unanimously approved second  the state department was represented by an assistant who says clinton did not intervene third  the uranium one deal stipulates that the uranium must be sold to civilian reactor operators in the united states  which blows trump s claim that hillary gave  percent of our uranium to russia out of the water fourth  one man gave the clinton foundation all but   million of the   million donated by nine individuals associated with uranium one  and that one man had already sold his stake in the company years before in   well before clinton even thought about being secretary of state  and long before barack obama became president to make her secretary of state and  finally  clinton had no power to veto or approve the deal herself so  that means conservatives have no case against clinton  effectively neutering any effort by the justice department to appoint a special prosecutor since doing so is contingent on the facts  and the facts support clinton  so much so  that any court would laugh the obviously manufactured charges out of court here s the video via youtube in response  trump supporters threw a temper tantrum and called for fox to fire smith for reporting the facts you need to get that hack  shepnewsteam out of fox  he just made excuses for  crookedhillary and is clearly a double agent  hey shep   hillary took the  regardless of when it was sent  pay for play you goof  lab lover   dutchistheballs  november    wallace and shepard smith should start a show on cnn called  pink hat brigade  that s where you both belong  shameful fox  get rid of these two asshats   matt couch     realmattcouch  november    foxnews if i wanted to see an unfactual and slanted view i would watch cnn  i can t watch shepard smith anymore  i m dont with that show  he is arrogant and clearly anti trump  jim hennahane     november    these are just a few of the many angry conservative tweets calling for smith to be fired  however  a majority of the tweets came in support of smith and his fact based reporting  which blew apart the rest of the network s effort to spin the deal into a nefarious scandal proving that hillary colluded with the russians seriously shep smith did his job as a journalist  sean hannity could certainly learn a lot from smith  the uranium one scandal being pushed by trump and his minions has been repeatedly debunked  conservatives are desperately attacking clinton to distract from trump s real scandals  but smith refuses to lie to make trump look good  and that s the real reason why trump supporters hate him so much featured image  screenshot
