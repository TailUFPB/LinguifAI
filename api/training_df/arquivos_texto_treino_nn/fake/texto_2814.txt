we know that trump wants to ban muslims from being able to enter the u s  at all  but faces significant hurdles to actually do it  so he just did an end run around all those obstacles by instituting what he keeps calling  extreme vetting   because he apparently believes that our current vetting process for refugees is not only non existent  but preferential towards muslims  and discriminatory towards christians today  he signed two executive orders   one to spur new defense spending  and another to ban visa entries from syria  iran  iraq  somalia  libya  sudan and yemen  but not countries where he has business  because of course   and to institute  extreme vetting  for refugees  i am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical islamic terrorists out of the united states of america  we don t want them here we want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas  we only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people  can we say muslim ban  there s the above  plus trump actually told the christian broadcasting network s david brody the following   been horribly treated  do you know if you were a christian in syria it was impossible  at least very tough to get into the united states  if you were a muslim you could come in  but if you were a christian  it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair  everybody was persecuted in all fairness  but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the christians  and i thought it was very  very unfair  so we are going to help them  there are a lot of conclusions that can be drawn from that alone  but aside from trump s insane lie namely that we deliberately discriminate against christians this action sounds an awful lot like a precursor to his muslim ban  if he were to support sen  tom cotton s bill that would allow religious minorities to apply directly for refugee status here  while muslim refugees would likely still have to go through the u n   suddenly muslims have a harder time getting here than anyone else it s true that we get a lot more muslim refugees than christian refugees  but there s a reason for that and it s not because we re favoring muslims  currently  refugees are generally referred to the united states via the united nations  refugee camp in jordan   they don t apply to the u s  directly  it s a majority muslim region   therefore most applicants are going to be muslims christians then go to the more urban areas where they re likely to be safer  and they might be coming into the u s  by way of other immigration pathways put all of these things together  along with republicans  desire to end funding for the u n   and we re most of the way to an out and out muslim ban without actually creating a law or an edict that bans muslims featured image by olivier douliery via getty images
