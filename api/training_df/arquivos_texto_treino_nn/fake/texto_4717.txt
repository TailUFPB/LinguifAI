goldman sachs group inc  has just sent the trump campaign a message that is going to make them furious  especially coming from one of the largest investment banks in the country recently  the bank banned all of its top officials from donating to trump s campaign   which is kind of hilarious considering how much trump s campaign is struggling  in a memo right now  the bank instructed its highest ranking employees  effective thursday  september   all partners across the firm are considered  restricted persons  as defined by the firm s policy on personal political activities in the us  as outlined below  restricted persons are prohibited from engaging in political activities and or making campaign contributions to candidates running for state and local offices  as well as sitting state and local officials running for federal office the policy change is meant to prevent inadvertently violating pay to play rules  particularly the look back provision  when partners transition into roles covered by these rules  the penalties for failing to comply with these rules can be severe and include fines and a ban on the firm from doing business with government clients in a particular jurisdiction for a period of at least two years the policy change is also meant to minimize potential reputational damage caused by any false perception that the firm is attempting to circumvent pay to play rules  particularly given partners  seniority and visibility  all failures to pre clear political activities as outlined below are taken seriously and violations may result in disciplinary action  damn  and to make this even more brilliant  goldman sachs specifically called out the trump campaign when they described the types of donations that are banned  any federal candidate who is a sitting state or local official  e g   governor running for president or vice president  such as the trump pence ticket  or mayor running for congress   including their political action committees  pacs   twittertwitterthe interesting thing here is that both trump and clinton s running mates hold a position in a political office   yet only trump s vp pick  indiana governor mike pence  is mentioned  to make matters even worse  these rules don t restrict donations to clinton s campaign because kaine is a u s  senator for virginia and not considered a local official according to goldman sachs  rules  although the memo does say employees cannot donate to the virginia democratic party  although goldman sachs  ceo hasn t officially said who he is voting for  it s public knowledge that he s a long time clinton fan  and had donated to her campaign when she ran against obama in  you can read the full memo here  as obtained by fortune featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
