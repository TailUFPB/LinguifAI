north carolina is stuck in the past and the city of charlotte just sold out to join the rest of the state ever since the charlotte city council voted for a non discrimination ordinance to protect lgbt people  republicans have thrown a hissy fit about  leading the gop controlled legislature to pass hb   which severely restricted the rights of lgbt people and gave businesses the ability to discriminate against them at will the evil law has cost the state thousands of jobs and millions of dollars as companies have refused to do business in north carolina  entertainers and sports organizations have also punished the state for months  the charlotte city council refused to repeal the ordinance and stood up for the rights of lgbt people but on monday  the charlotte city council betrayed the lgbt community by taking a vote they said they would not take in exchange for a special session that merely could result in the full repeal of hb   the charlotte city council voted unanimously to repeal the non discrimination ordinance  and governor elect roy cooper persuaded them to do so  senate leader phil berger and house speaker tim moore assured me that as a result of charlotte s vote  a special session will be called for tuesday to repeal hb  in full   cooper said   i hope they will keep their word to me and with the help of democrats in the legislature   will be repealed in full  full repeal will help to bring jobs  sports and entertainment events back and will provide the opportunity for strong lgbt protections in our state  and that s complete bullshit since republicans control the state legislature and will never allow the state of north carolina to move into the  century  also  cooper and the city council screwed over the lgbt community for a mere assurance that there will be a special session  and even if they do  that does not guarantee that hb  will be repealed  in fact  they ll probably keep it just to humiliate cooper even more than they already have when the gop held special sessions to strip him of power before he takes office mayor jennifer roberts had the gall to claim the city council vote  should in no way be viewed as a compromise of our principles or commitment to non discrimination  here s video of the charlotte city council betraying the lgbt community and that s exactly what they did  they sold out the lgbt community by going back to the status quo  which is that businesses and public institutions can now openly discriminate against lgbt people cooper and the charlotte city council have opened themselves up to being accused of playing politics and that they re the ones who hurt the state instead of the republican legislature that passed hb  and they deserve the criticism the people of charlotte did not even get the opportunity to voice their opinion before the vote took place  it happened secretly and swiftly and human rights were sacrificed for an empty promise that republicans will not honor  in fact  they don t have to repeal hb  at all  and even if they do  cooper and the charlotte city council just surrendered the moral high ground by letting republicans know that they can bullied into abandoning what s right roy cooper and the charlotte city council are a bunch of disgraceful cowards and the boycott of north carolina  especially charlotte  should continue featured image  screenshot
