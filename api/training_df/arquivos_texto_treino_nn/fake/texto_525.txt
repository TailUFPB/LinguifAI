donald trump has been wasting taxpayer dollars on his personal vacations  protection for his giant golden tower in new york  security at his golf clubs  and pretty much everything else you can imagine ever since he assumed office  but if you needed an example of how bad things are we can t even afford to pay the secret service agents protecting him anymore cnbc reports that more than   agents have  already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year  thanks to the  crushing workload  donald trump has brought them the secret service has a big job with the trump family  not only do they have to protect him as he jaunts from golf course to golf course  but they are also forced to protect his sniveling children on their business trips both in the united states and abroad  the president has a large family  and our responsibility is required in law   secret service director randolph  tex  alles said in an interview   i can t change that  i have no flexibility  the trump family is such a big problem that alles says that without more funding  he won t even be able to pay agents for work they have already done the compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents  from    per year to    for at least the duration of trump s first term but even if such a proposal was approved  about  veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed  according to the agency  i don t see this changing in the near term   alles said as the trump family continues to bleed the country dry with their constant vacations and business trips   all of which require secret service protection   congress is actually considering giving them more money to flush down the toilet as they are forced to pay for hotel rooms  travel  and even     and growing  in golf cart rentals the solution isn t to give the trump family more money  it s time for congress to take action to limit travel or pass legislation that would exempt personal vacations and business trips for the president s children from requiring secret service protection once the agency s budget has been exhausted it s time for the trump family to begin living within the country s means featured image via getty images alex wong
