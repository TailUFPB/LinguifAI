reince priebus openly threatened kasich and other republicans that they better blindly support donald trump or face the end of their careers  john kasich doesn t give a shit about priebus  pathetic threats on sunday  the gop chair suggested that republicans who don t fall in line behind trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re election  those people need to get on board   priebus told face the nation  and if they re thinking they re going to run again someday  i think that we re going to evaluate the process   of the nomination process and i don t think it s going to be that easy for them  in order to be on the ballot in south carolina  you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee  no matter who that person is  so what s the penalty for that  it s not a threat  but that s just the question that we have a process in place  kasich has repeatedly refused to endorse donald trump and did not take kindly to priebus  threat  issuing a brutal response through his spokesman john weaver  thankfully  there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics  the idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like reince priebus  but it is at the center of everything governor kasich does the governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on reince s watch  weaver also added that priebus should be thanking kasich so the next time john kasich seeks re election or high office it s going to be interesting to watch how priebus responds  will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about face and all of a sudden support kasich threatening someone with political ruin just because they don t support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do  it s definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy  because by trying to force republicans to vote a certain way  they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon if anyone deserves political backlash  it s reince priebus  he created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have trump as their leader  the republicans standing against trump are the sane ones featured image via mark wilson getty images
