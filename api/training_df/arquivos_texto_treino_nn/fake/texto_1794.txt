a few years ago  very few people even knew what breitbart com was  it was a fringe website that only white supremacists and other bigots frequented  and the people who posted anonymously there almost certainly didn t voice their views publicly  all of that changed in  when donald trump began running for president trump s campaign brought white supremacy mainstream  as he regularly retweeted neo nazis  refused to immediately disavow former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke  and readily embraced the white supremacist  alt right   breitbart itself went completely mainstream when stephen k  bannon  who ran the place  left its stewardship to become trump s campaign ceo now that breitbart and its toxic brand of hate is literally steps from the oval office  people who are opposed to its hateful ideology are putting pressure on major retailers to pull their advertising dollars from the right wing hate site  the latest to receive such pressure is online retail giant amazon according to the hill  amazon ceo jeff bezos was asked by more than  of his employees via email to stop funding hate by advertising on breitbart  in another exchange during a meeting  another high ranking amazon official  jeff blackburn  was asked point blank by an employee to kill the breitbart advertising because the site  regularly publishes hateful and bigoted content   one employee said the following of her experiences since people now know what breitbart is  when people find out i work at amazon  the first question they ask is   how can you justify working for amazon when they advertise on a hate site   now  amazon is being heckled from outside its own ranks as well more than   signatures have been accumulated on a petition that demands amazon stop investing in hate  via its breitbart advertising perhaps the most effective effort will come from the social media activist group sleeping giant  which has successfully gotten more than   companies to cease and desist with the breitbart advertising  major companies that caved to the pressure include bmv  nordstrom  the company that infamously yanked ivanka s clothing line   and kellogg keep the pressure on  folks  boycotts and bad headlines work  personally  i ll be using jet com until amazon gets its act together featured image via screen capture from talk android
