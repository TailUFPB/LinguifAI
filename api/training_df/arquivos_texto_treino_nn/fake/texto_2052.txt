donald trump is another step closer to suffering a major policy defeat  and that s good news for the affordable care act trump and house republicans have been pushing for passage of a bill they dubiously refer to as the  american healthcare act   depsite the fact that s it not american nor is it healthcare indeed  the legislation is designed to kill the affordable care act  which slowed the rising costs of health insurance premiums and extended healthcare coverage to tens of millions of americans if republicans pass trumpcare  millions of americans will lose their coverage and the price of healthcare will skyrocket  especially among senior citizens the republican bill is a bad one  but trump  who thinks it s  wonderful   went to capitol hill on tuesday to beg republicans to pass it and threatened to punish any republicans who vote against it several republicans who attended the meeting told the washington post that trump literally promised to  come after  them  i m gonna come after you  but i know i won t have to  because i know you ll vote  yes   trump said   honestly  a loss is not acceptable  folks  but apparently  trump s threats spectacularly backfired and his self manufactured reputation as a  dealmaker  took a humiliating hit prior to the meeting  nbc had counted  republicans who were leaning against the bill  after the meeting nbc counted   which means ten republicans turned against trump and his pathetic health care bill in a matter of hours republicans are hoping to bring the bill up for a vote on the house floor on thursday  but it won t pass if gop leadership can t keep the number of republicans leaning against it under  this would be a humiliating defeat for trump  especially after he has repeatedly hyped the bill on social media on wednesday morning  trump bragged about the bill on twitter again big day for healthcare  working hard   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    s a big day alright  will these  republicans refuse to let trump bully them into voting for a bad bill or will they stand their ground and kill it on behalf of the tens of millions of americans who desperately need their healthcare coverage if they stand their ground  trump will be a loser  but the american people will win  and last time i checked  congressmen work for the people  not trump featured image via aude guerrucci pool getty images
