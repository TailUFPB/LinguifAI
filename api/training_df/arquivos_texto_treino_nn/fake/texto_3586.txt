with many people still recovering from such a horrendous election result  it s left quite a few people unable to get into the christmas spirit  especially knowing that the nation is about to be handed over to a tiny handed orange bully who tweets his verbal diarrhea with no filter whatsoever however  as it seems at the moment  donald trump will  in fact  be inaugurated as the united states   president  and we all need to somehow wrap our heads around that in the mean time  with some much needed levity during this terrible time in history for all the world  alisha brophy and scott miles have put together a brilliant stop motion animated video featuring lego donald trump and his takeover of the north pole from santa claus the video features trump even going after the baby jesus  throwing a hissy fit on twitter  and thanking his pal russian president vladimir putin  who appears on a lego bear most notably  there are several lines stolen and adapted directly from what trump has said in real life  including his horrific statements towards women  such as  when you re santa  you can do whatever  grab  em by the antlers  all in all  this is pretty damn brilliant  well done watch here featured image via video screen capture
