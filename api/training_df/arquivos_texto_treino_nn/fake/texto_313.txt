on saturday  donald trump tweeted a dire warning about iran test firing a missile  and proclaiming that the country was  working with north korea   whatever that means  the tweet was easy to overlook  since it was part of a litany of unhinged rants about obamacare  alabama s special election  a basketball player  the national football league  and his idea of patriotism iran just test fired a ballistic missile capable of reaching israel they are also working with north korea not much of an agreement we have   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september     minutes later  trump was back to talking about repealing healthcare for millions of americans and calling john mccain a coward  and  minutes after that  trump was back to the nfl  like i said  i don t blame you if you missed it thankfully  the tweet is still there  that could come in handy  should anyone decide to do anything about the fact that he was either lying or a complete moron  or even more disturbingly  that the president of the united states is using fake video to start a war with iran  or perhaps donald trump simply didn t recognize the exact same footage that he put iran  on notice  for at the beginning of february iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile should have been thankful for the terrible deal the u s  made with them   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    news  the president s very favorite for of media  is now reporting that the  missile launch  that trump was referring to on saturday was in fact video from a launch in january  there was no missile fired on saturday   iranian media was simply showing what the missile they included in a parade that day was capable of conducting international affairs via social media is nothing new for donald trump  it was scarcely hours before he had casually threatened north korea with total nuclear annihilation via twitter  by tomorrow  the us may find itself embroiled in world war three if someone doesn t take that idiot s cell phone away from him sadly  nothing would make trump happier than a new conflict  since wartime presidents are far more popular and important than those who govern peacefully over periods of expansion and global goodwill that s what war would mean to donald trump  ratings featured image via majid getty images
