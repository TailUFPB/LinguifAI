one of donald trump s strongest allies just turned against him and may have just cost herself a cabinet position in the process it s a win win really not only do we get to watch sarah palin slam donald trump for making a shitty deal  we get the satisfaction of knowing that he probably won t consider her for any cabinet post at all  including secretary of veterans affairs earlier this week  trump bragged that he was meeting with carrier  a company in indiana that was planning to send american jobs overseas  well  trump only saved nearly   jobs while more than   jobs were still sent to mexico  oh  and carrier got a sweet deal for it  too  taxpayers in indiana will be giving carrier   million to keep the smattering of jobs that are left  it s a very high price to pay and is a waste of taxpayer dollars that sets the stage for more companies to do the exact same thing in order to snag millions of taxpayer dollars  all they have to do is threaten to send jobs overseas and get trump to  negotiate  to keep some of them in short  trump is an easy mark for companies to exploit  but sarah palin is not supportive of what trump is doing in an op ed for young conservatives  palin blasted trump s bad deal with carrier as  crony capitalism  that will doom the free market and the country  when government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies  favoring one business over others  it sets inconsistent  unfair  illogical precedent   she wrote   meanwhile  the invisible hand that best orchestrates a free people s free enterprise system gets amputated  then  special interests creep in and manipulate markets  republicans oppose this  remember  instead  we support competition on a level playing field  remember  because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail  politicians picking and choosing recipients of corporate welfare is railed against by fiscal conservatives  for it s a hallmark of corruption  and socialism a   trillion debt ridden country can t afford this sinfully stupid practice  so vigilantly guard against its continuance  or we re doomed but know that fundamentally  political intrusion using a stick or carrot to bribe or force one individual business to do what politicians insist  versus establishing policy incentivizing our entire ethical economic engine to roar back to life  isn t the answer trump s deal with carrier was nothing more than a theatrical photo op stunt designed to fool us into believing that he is saving american businesses  but he only did the exact opposite  eventually  carrier will threaten to send more jobs overseas and they will expect yet another government handout to be paid by taxpayers  it s free money for businesses  so businesses will likely take advantage of this and will decide to send jobs overseas in an effort to secure millions in taxpayer subsidies  it s windfall for corporations  but a costly disaster for taxpayers  because now corporations will just hold jobs hostage and will demand taxpayer money in return for keeping just some of those jobs in the united states once again  donald trump is a loser who makes bad business deals  and this time he is dragging america down with him featured image  screenshot
