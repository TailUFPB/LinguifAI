for some reason  the trump campaign is utterly clueless about the alt right movement and what it stands for  trump himself regularly retweets stuff from those deplorable  oops  we said it  excuses for human beings and then brushes it off  if he even says anything at all  he even enthusiastically tweeted an image of himself as pepe the frog  a mascot for the neo nazis  which is bad enough given that trump keeps saying he ll work for all americans one of his top advisers  roger stone  now  is saying he s proud to walk alongside trump as a symbol for the neo nazi movement while he s protesting hillary s  basket of deplorables  comment aimed at half of trump s followers the irony is strong in this one stone thinks he s going to turn the word  deplorables  around the way that president obama turned  obamacare  from something derogatory into something with his signature on it  he will make this backfire on hillary  because of course  it s his own idea that s backfiring though   all he s done is prove that an awful lot of trump s supporters are really deplorable people image via twitterpepe the frog has been around for awhile  to be sure  it recently became unacceptable  however  as the neo nazis began working towards claiming pepe as a racist  white nationalist symbol so now pepe represents what he was always supposed to represent  and he s in a likeness of donald trump  roger stone has an image co opted from  the expendables   showing trump as a neo nazi mascot  that he s put on social media and he s probably amazingly proud of his ingenious idea this isn t the first time trump s been depicted as pepe  in   trump retweeted a different image of himself as pepe standing in front of an american flag  and behind a podium  the alt right worked to associate their mascot with trump because they believe that trump represents them  and who wouldn t  the toxic waste fountain on the front of trump s face spouts everything they want to hear   codyave   drudgereport  breitbartnews  writeintrump  you can t stump the trump  https   t co  pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    sheer hypocrisy involved in promoting trump as anything dealing with white nationalist groups while whining about hillary insulting half of trump s voters is just absurd  white nationalists  who make up an awful lot of the alt right  are far more hateful and discriminating than hillary ever could be the truth is that these are people who think that immigration equals white genocide  some on the alt right hate women and everything to do with women  a lot of them think that some races are inherently more stupid than others  and deserve to be treated as such  these are people who are as anti semitic as adolf hitler in short  they re deplorable people  and stone is busy complaining that hillary called them what they are while directly associating trump with them  any reasonable campaign and any reasonable adviser would find a different way to make that backfire on hillary   the trump camp is too entrenched with the alt right and too full of itself to realize what they ve actually done  though featured image via screen capture from roger stone s tweet
