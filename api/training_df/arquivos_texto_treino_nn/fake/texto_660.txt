donald trump doesn t just flip flop on his campaign promises and policies   he also walks back his own insults whenever it s convenient for him to do so on saturday  trump completely embarrassed himself by praising attorney general jeff sessions  the man he had just spent the last two weeks mercilessly trashing  after sessions announced that the justice department would be doubling down on leakers  trump tweeted this  after many years of leaks going on in washington  it is great to see the a g  taking action  for national security  the tougher the better  that s right   trump is seriously acting like he hasn t been attacking sessions for weeks because the a g  decided to recuse himself from trump s russia investigation  most notably  trump stated that if he d known sessions was going to recuse himself  he wouldn t have hired him as attorney general in the first place  things were getting so heated that there were even rumors that trump might fire sessions  now  trump is trying to kiss up to sessions in a pathetic attempt to get the a g  on his side trump is not a man of integrity  he will literally do anything to get ahead and advance himself   he won t even stand by his own word  we ve seen this time and time again as trump walks back his previous comments  proving that he is extremely unstable and nothing he says can be trusted  he will lie about anything to get people on his side or protect himself from having to answer to his faults  it is up to americans not to forget trump s prior transgressions  and hold him accountable whenever he tries to disguise himself as a somewhat decent human being  hopefully  sessions doesn t forget what trump did to him either  because trump is one person who doesn t deserve to brown nose his way out of this featured image via tom pennington and win mcnamee   getty images
