he went there  we all knew he d go there  but on monday donald trump deigned it appropriate to attack meryl streep after she made some rather pointed remarks about accepting others in her speech at the golden globes  without naming trump by name  she managed to twist the knife deep in the donald s abdomen with very little effort  there was one performance this year that stunned me  it sank its hooks in my heart   streep said  referencing trump s attacks on a disabled new york times reporter last year   not because it was good  there was nothing good about it  but it was effective and it did its job  it was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter   she continued   someone he outranked in privilege  power and the capacity to fight back  it kind of broke my heart when i saw it and i still can t get it out of my head because it wasn t in a movie  it was real life   streep said   this instinct to humiliate when it s modeled by someone in the public   by someone powerful  it filters down into everyone s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same  calling on the press to  hold power to account   streep very correctly pointed out that  when the powerful use their position to bully others  we all lose  naturally  this was too much for trump to handle  in an interview with the new york times monday morning  trump denied mocking anyone at all  i was never mocking anyone   mr  trump said   i was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story   trump  of course  was referencing a  year article written by serge f  kovaleski that he had attempted to use to prove that muslims were celebrating in the streets in reality  kovaleski correctly reported that police  swept up in the paranoia directly following    had detained a number of people who had allegedly celebrated  ultimately  there was one account of people  celebrating in the streets  at the time and it was five young israeli men  who were certainly not muslims  people keep saying i intended to mock the reporter s disability  as if meryl streep and others could read my mind  and i did no such thing  he told the times  and remember  meryl streep introduced hillary clinton at her convention  and a lot of these people supported hillary  he then took to twitter to attack streep as  one of the most over rated actresses in hollywood  and a  hillary flunky who lost big  meryl streep  one of the most over rated actresses in hollywood  doesn t know me but attacked last night at the golden globes  she is a     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    flunky who lost big  for the  time  i never  mocked  a disabled reporter  would never do that  but simply showed him    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    groveling  when he totally changed a  year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad  just more very dishonest media   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    for reference  this is donald trump  not mocking anyone  naturally  twitter erupted in fury both at trump s revisionist claim that he had not mocked anyone and his attack on a woman who simply said that the guy sitting at the head of the table shouldn t be a dick to the dinner guests trump reacting to anything  basically pic twitter com   parker
