during a time of national crisis  most presidents focus on helping people in need  but not donald trump  instead  he is sending out mass text messages to stroke his own ego and try to raise money  he keeps telling his fans that if they don t keep donating  their big election upset will all be for naught  here are the texts he sent to his most ardent fans  and a few people who just subscribe for the lulz  now  to put this into context  the people of puerto rico are literally dying  trump has  instead of trying to help them  attacked the mayor of san juan on twitter for begging for help to save the lives of the americans who live there  and his disaster response has been abysmal  because  you know  brown people  and now  he sends out lying mass communications pretending that he has helped people and delivered on promises when he has done no such thing  hell  there is plenty of evidence that there was even a point in time when trump didn t even realize that the people of puerto rico are american citizens in short  this is a man who is raising money off the backs of suffering and dying people  and using the protests of nfl players who want to use their platforms to shine a light on the injustices suffered at the hands of law enforcement by people of color to stoke racial divisions in the nation  in fact  there is even evidence that this part of it was planned  msnbc s rachel maddow explains that bit perfectly donald trump s racist  divisive actions are absolutely disgraceful  and people are literally dying on his watch  this man is not a president  he s a racist and a murderer featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
