it s not unprecedented but it s a clear f ck you aimed at donald trump in november  the chicago cubs broke a  year drought to finally win the world series again  they defied the odds  and unlike trump  they didn t need help from russia to secure a victory president obama  who hails from chicago  congratulated the cubs and invited them to the white house to be honored for their historic achievement it happened   cubs win world series  that s change even this south sider can believe in  want to come to the white house before i leave   president obama   potus  november    also called team manager joe madden to extend the invitation personally usually  world series champions flock to the white house for recognition in april  which would mean the team would have to deal with donald trump  who would likely politicize the event in an effort to tie it to his electoral win  hillary clinton is also a fan of the cubs so trump could easily use the event to take shots at her as well to save the country from such embarrassment and to avoid shaking trump s tiny hands  the cubs have decided that it is more convenient for them to travel to the white house on monday while president obama is still in office as mediaite points out  teams have visited the white house early in previous years so this would normally not be a big deal  but this is not a normal time because if the cubs wait until april they would have to stand and be honored by a bigot who constantly hurls petty insults at people and thinks everything is about himself trump will likely feel slighted by the cubs and will launch an attack against them on twitter any time now  but doing so will only confirm that the cubs made the right decision featured image  wikimedia
