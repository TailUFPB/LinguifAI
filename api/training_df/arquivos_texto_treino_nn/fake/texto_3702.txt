you know how donald trump has been trying to convince us that steve bannon is a great guy and his publication  breitbart  is just a news website that isn t a haven for white supremacists  white nationalists  and a diverse array of racists  bigots  and people who are fine with racism  well  that s going to be just a teensy bit harder now after the publication was banned by an ad vendor for hate speech  breitbart is just a publication   trump said in a recent interview with the new york times   they are certainly a much more conservative paper  to put it mildly  than the new york times  but breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful  it s got readers  and it does cover subjects on the right  but it covers subjects on the left also  it s a pretty big thing  there s no question that breitbart is a  big thing   but that s not exactly a good thing when it s something that bannon himself described breitbart as the  platform for the alt right   a term used to describe white supremacists who took a day off of abusing methamphetamines to throw on a suit and complain about the plight of white people in a seemingly legitimate setting  nevertheless  trump says he would never have hired bannon had he any indicator  like an admission from bannon that he runs a large platform for white supremacists  that he was alt right  i ve known steve bannon a long time  if i thought he was a racist  or alt right   i wouldn t even think about hiring him  the donald says that he intends to get to the bottom of what is energizing the extreme right  him  and find out why  because he appeals to racists  trump s decision to appoint a white nationalist to a high level position spurred appnexus  a major advertising technology provider  to look into what sort of operation bannon had birthed   and they didn t like what they found appnexus inc   a major advertising technology provider  has barred breitbart news from using its ad serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules appnexus scrutinized breitbart s website after u s  president elect donald trump tapped steve bannon  former executive chairman of breitbart  to be white house chief strategist last week  the digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence  said appnexus spokesman joshua zeitz  we did a human audit of breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line  using either coded or overt language   he said bloomberg notes that while breitbart does not buy ads from appnexus directly  the ban means that they will not receive ads from the ad server the company runs and this will likely lower the price of ads on the site   which means less money for the modern day neo nazis will more advertising companies follow suit  only time will tell   but the pressure is certainly on featured image via getty images  ben jackson
