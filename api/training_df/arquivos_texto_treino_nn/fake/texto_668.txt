first  he impaneled a grand jury  then the grand jury began issuing subpoenas  now  investigators working for special counsel robert mueller have issued an official request for white house documents pertaining to the russia investigation  specifically  they re looking for things related to michael flynn  russia  and turkey  the requests aren t subpoenas  but they could become subpoenas if the white house refuses to hand them over investigators are interested in payments that flynn received for speeches given to russian companies  flynn s financial disclosure forms initially didn t include the payments from the russian companies  and he had to file an amended version with those payments later on gee  it almost looks like he tried to hide his contacts with anyone russian  just like jared kushner and jeff sessions but mueller s team is also looking into trump s own financial ties with russia  and other possible financial crimes on trump s part  too  trump tried to intimidate mueller on that front  warning him not to go that far and to keep the investigation s focus on russian collusion  mueller has  more or less  told trump to go screw himself  trump s outside counsel says that they ll resist anything from mueller s office that goes beyond the  mandate specified in the appointment  oh  please  that positively reeks of fear  it s also further evidence that the trump administration doesn t believe that the department of justice or any agency within it should be independent of the white house the fbi is also interested in a    payment made to the flynn intel group for work on discrediting an opponent of the turkish government  they re looking to see if the turkish government was behind those payments  or if it really was a private deal between flynn s company and a turkish american businessman  they ve begun questioning people on this very thing  too it s not illegal to be paid by foreign governments  it is illegal to fail to register as a foreign agent while taking those payments  flynn s registration as a foreign agent only happened after his company s work with turkey was revealed the fear is there and it s real  mueller has cast a very wide net and it s beginning to catch some fish  trump s  day vacation has a dark cloud over it  as does the white house featured image via chris kleponis pool getty images
