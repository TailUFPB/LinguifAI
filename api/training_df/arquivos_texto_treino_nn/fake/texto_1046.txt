canadian prime minister justin trudeau participated in a forum on thursday  which was hosted by the new york times  to discuss current relations between canada and the united states  trudeau was as suave as ever for the most part and tried hard to play down the fact that donald trump is a raving f cking lunatic  however  when the conversation turned to trump s tweets  he accidentally pointed out what an irresponsible child the current  president  actually is trudeau was asked if he has his phone set to notify him when trump sends out a tweet  like many of us do  without even trying  the prime minister s response made trump look like a damn fool  there s no question that the way the president chooses to speak directly to people through social media is a new wrinkle in international diplomacy   trudeau replied  he explained that deciphering how serious to take any given tweet of trump s is important so that canada can respond  without reacting to a similar level  the interviewers continued to press trudeau on the matter  asking him if he is  in bed  like the rest of us  looking at twitter at night   and that is when it came  he made trump look like an absolute moron simply by doing his job and not being a twitter obsessed narcissist  no  i tend to focus on the things i need to do  on my job   trudeau said  causing the audience to burst into laughter  realizing that he had just unintentionally wiped the floor with trump  he added  if i get woken up at night  it better be for something more important than a tweet   this just caused the crowd to laugh even harder   by anyone   he said as an afterthought  but the everyone in the room was still howling with laughter you can watch a video of this exchange below and you can watch trudeau s entire interview here featured image via win mcnamee getty images
