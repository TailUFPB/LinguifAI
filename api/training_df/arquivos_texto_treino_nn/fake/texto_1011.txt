if you read anything about the supreme court today  it was likely that they upheld a good portion of donald trump s muslim ban  if that alone didn t show you that elections matter  a decision that s largely been flying under the radar is at least equally disturbing  in a brutal wound to the first amendment  the court told states that they have no right to not fund churches  even if separation of church and state is in their constitutions the case surrounded a playground in missouri and it all seems like a no brainer when you look at the surface  missouri wanted to make playgrounds safer  but their state constitution prohibited state money from making church playgrounds safer  who could possibly be against making playgrounds safer  right  unfortunately  it s not that simple  as i mentioned  not giving taxpayer money to churches is part of missouri s constitution  thirty eight states have similar conditions chief justice john roberts  who wrote the majority opinion  felt that not providing money to churches was discriminatory chief justice john g  roberts jr   writing for the majority  said the united states constitution forbids some forms of discrimination against religious institutions  officials in missouri  he wrote  were not entitled to reject an application from a lutheran church for a grant to use recycled tires to resurface a playground justice sonia sotomayor and justice ruth bader ginsburg dissented  sotomayor got to the heart of the issue in her dissenting opinion  which is that it s not just about playgrounds to hear the court tell it  this is a simple case about recycling tires to resurface a playground  the stakes are higher  this case is about nothing less than the relation  ship between religious institutions and the civil govern  ment that is  between church and state  the court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding  for the first time  that the constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church  its decision slights both our precedents and our history  and its reasoning weakens this country s longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both imagine if instead of playgrounds  this case was about pregnancy and std prevention among teenagers  would states be forced to fund church based abstinence only programs at the same rate as they fund scientifically based approaches  are states expected to fund discrimination against lgbtq people the fact is that churches pay no taxes  in part because of separation of church and state and in part to leave them alone to do the charity work they do  they are already taxpayer funded  just by the mere fact that they don t pay taxes featured image via eric thayer getty images
