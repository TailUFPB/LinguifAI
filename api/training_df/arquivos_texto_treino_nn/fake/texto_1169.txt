if anything more than a grunt passes between the lips of a republican  one can typically be assured he or she is lying   and that was the case when a group of constituents delivered cookies to arizona rep  david schweikert a group of citizens  members of a group called az indivisible   showed up outside schweikert s office earlier this year hoping to bribe him into hearing their concerns  instead  the congressman had his staff call the police while we can t be sure if he told the cops the same story he is telling his supporters  a letter his office sent out says that the cookie delivering citizens  incite violence  and  light cars on fire  as they  clash with police  because they will  stop at no turn  the left is determined to disrupt and disorganize  they are organizing new groups every single day and investing big resources neighborhood to neighborhood across maricopa county   the letter begins   then it becomes  more  insane despite the congressman s allegations  scottsdale police officer kevin watts says that there have been no reports of violence  clashes with our officers or incidents of criminal damage associated with representative schweikert s office to date  in other words schweikert  like seemingly all republicans  is a liar  the people belonging to the groups referenced are mostly women  mostly have more than a few years on them   the most dangerous physical weapons we have are knitting needles  but make no mistake   we vote   we are actively encouraging others to vote  and lots of us are educating ourselves on how politics works and running for office   a member of indivisible told the republic   does this sound like people plotting violence  we are working within the system  sadly  this sort of behavior is typical of republicans  you ask them questions  you expect them to be held accountable  you try to get a little face time to discuss actual issues   and they respond by lying about you featured image via screengrab
