 build the wall  build the wall   supposedly nobody builds better walls than donald trump  and the government is already hard at work acquiring the land and materials necessary to build a wall that s likely to do nothing to stop people from crossing the southern border  now  a new study shows that the border wall may also be more a more unjustified waste of money than ever illegal immigration has been falling since   but this latest bit of research out of the university of california  san diego  says it will continue to fall  it s partly because of obama   contrary to what xenophobic conservatives say  obama did not favor or enable an open border  he made stemming the flow of immigrants a priority of his administration  the right wing is pissed because he also worked to protect people who were already here however  the biggest causes of the drop are actually far more subtle and beyond the control of even the most hard line  xenophobic white house  economic trends  such as falling demand for low skilled workers  play a huge role too  that s a long term trend that these researchers don t see reversing itself anytime soon there s also a major demographic component to this   our baby boom ended rather quickly in the early   however  in latin america  it fell off far more gradually  resulting in a much larger number of younger latin american workers who could find better opportunities here  in the  and early   than in their home countries that also is no longer true  the birth rate in latin america is now about the same as ours  resulting in a falloff in the number of people trying to come here for opportunity  furthermore  the population of undocumented immigrants that we do have is aging  over the next few decades  they ll be forced to either start paying ridiculous medical bills out of pocket  or they ll find themselves forced to return to their home countries if you combine these factors  the number of people trying to cross the border illegally will continue to drop  in fact  the researchers believe it will fall sharply over the next  years even without a wall and yet  here s trump and all his loyal subjects still chanting that a wall  which will cost anywhere from   billion to   billion and take years to build  is absolutely necessary to securing the border  but nobody actually knows how much money we could waste on this wall because no reliable estimates exist  according to u s  customs and border protection  there are too  many variables that are currently unknown  to be able to accurately estimate this cost yet they re asking for    billion for just  miles of new barriers for   that s a lot of money for less than  miles of barrier we already knew that we  the taxpayers  were going to foot the bill for something that s probably not going to work  but now we re going to foot the bill for something that isn t just ineffective  but is wholly unnecessary featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
