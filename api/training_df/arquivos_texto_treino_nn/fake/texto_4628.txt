donald trump is likely pleasing the gop establishment lately because he hasn t been totally crazy  however  the embarrassing video of a black female pastor  faith green timmons  shutting him down when he tried to use her church podium like a campaign rally went viral  and of course trump couldn t resist attacking the pastor like the toddler that he is at heart trump phoned in to his buddies over at fox and friends thursday morning  and said that the audience was great but the pastor was  quote  a  nervous mess   trump told the fox hosts  something was up  because i noticed she was so nervous when she introduced me  she called nbc  abc   when she got up to introduce me  she was so nervous  she was shaking  and i said   wow  this is sort of strange   and then  she came up  so she had that in mind  there s no question about it  now  of course this is likely untrue  the pastor of flint  michigan s bethel united methodist church did not look at all nervous when she shut trump down  but of course facts don t matter to the donald  all that matters is that he was embarrassed in public and video of it went viral  so the person who caused him said embarrassment must pay  here is video of that fox and friends exchange  this is not a person who has the character or temperament to be president  and of course that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all the things about donald trump that utterly disqualify him from being president of the united states  part of being in public life   especially political public life   is the ability to take criticism  that is simply an ability that trump does not possess  his ego and narcissism will not allow him to let any slight   perceived or real   go without launching some kind of attack  usually full of childish  untrue  low road insults remember  america   this man could be your next president  and he reacts like a  year old anytime anyone disagrees with him for any reason whatsoever featured image via wonkette
