donald trump likes to talk tough on terror  however  a new report links a trump hotel to   you guessed it   a terror cell  trump and his daughter wife ivanka built a hotel and tower in azerbaijan in  that was first a swanky high rise full of apartments  but in  it became yet another trump hotel  however  neither incarnation of the project ever opened for business now  it seems that the whole thing   called the trump international hotel and baku   is just a front for corruption tied to an oligarch by the name of ziya mammadov  mammadov s father also happens to be the transportation minister of azerbaijan  the united states government believes that this man is guilty of money laundering for iran s military  he has never been brought up on any such charges  though the whole thing looks even shadier when one considers statements from a former official with azerbaijan s ministry of tourism  he says of the trump property  why would someone put a luxury hotel there  nobody who can afford to stay there would want to be in that neighborhood  so  in other words  they have a dormant hotel in a shitty neighborhood for what legitimate purpose exactly  it also turns out that the aforementioned ziya mammadov  along with his brother elton mammadov are the ones who signed off on this sham property  it also helps to know that this whole family is corrupt to the core and basically make their money through government corruption  they also have suspicious ties to the iran s revolutionary guard  this is a terrorist cell that engages in things like trafficking drugs and sponsoring terrorist activities of course  one of trump s equally shady lawyers  alan garten  has already brushed aside the claims  saying that all trump did was lend his name to the building has no real ties to this whole corrupt mess  the thing is  though  there is money going into trump s pockets via this deal   to a tune of at least    million  perhaps more  to that end  do not expect any sort of rebuke of this corruption and sponsoring of terrorism from the trump administration clearly  trump s worldwide business interests will influence united states policy  when indeed it should not  ever  this is dangerous beyond anything we have ever seen before  he must be removed the entire report can be read here  at the new yorker featured image via jim lo scalzo   pool getty images
