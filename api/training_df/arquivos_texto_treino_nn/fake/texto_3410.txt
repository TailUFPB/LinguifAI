one of the most controversial figures in the upcoming trump administration  and this is out of a circus freak show of racist white men and corporate oligarchs  is general michael t  flynn  who s been slated to serve as trump s national security adviser  flynn  it seems  shared classified information flynn  like donald trump  seems to have an itchy trigger finger when it comes to computers  last month  flynn retweeted a fake news link that accused hillary clinton of engaging money laundering and sex crimes out of a d c  pizza joint  of course  this later became known as  pizzagate   and even prompted an armed gunman to storm the pizza place  but it s a trump world now  so that s all normal  right image via wayback machinejust four years ago  flynn presented his staff with a  how to dress for success  presentation that advised both men and women how to dress  it s as bad as you d imagine  while he encourages men to dress to exhibit  authority   the women have much different criteria  women are to dress to look attractive  but not too attractive  not gaudy but not plain  women need to wear makeup  but not too much makeup  they should  accentuate the positive disguise the negative  the most serious of flynn s foibles  though  is a revelation that he shared classified information with foreign military officers in afghanistan  the investigation took place in   and it was determined that while he did  inappropriately share  classified information   there was no actual or potential damage to national security   we don t have the details  because  well  they were classified  but for a national security adviser  this is more than troubling hillary clinton was defeated in part because trump and republicans made an email scandal that wasn t into a national security issue  trump  amidst cries of  drain the swamp   intermingled with  lock her up   promised a scandal free presidency  instead  we are getting far worse than more of the same  flynn should be disqualified  today featured image via spencer platt getty images
