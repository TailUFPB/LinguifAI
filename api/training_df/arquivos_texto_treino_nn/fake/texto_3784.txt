well  that didn t take long  in the short time since americans kinda sorta elected donald trump to be pussygrabber in chief  trump has appointed a bona fide white nationalist to a high level position and perform numerous other actions that months ago were considered extremely unlikely nightmare scenarios   and the latest seems to be that the muslim registry the media told us trump was not serious about might actually happen under the trump regime  muslim immigrants coming to the united states from what trump and pals call  terror prone  countries will soon have to register and check in regularly with the government if trump adviser and kansas secretary of state  kris kobach  has his way kobach says that the trump administration aims to quickly waste taxpayer dollars on the wall and that they are moving forward on a proposal to get things rolling with a registry for immigrants from muslim countries  reuters reports kansas secretary of state kris kobach  who helped write tough immigration laws in arizona and elsewhere  said in an interview that trump s policy advisers had also discussed drafting a proposal for his consideration to reinstate a registry for immigrants from muslim countries kobach  who media reports say is a key member of trump s transition team  said he had participated in regular conference calls with about a dozen trump immigration advisers for the past two to three months trump s transition team did not respond to requests for confirmation of kobach s role  the president elect has not committed to following any specific recommendations from advisory groups the national security entry exit registration system  designed in part by kovach under the bush administration  was an ineffective program that singled out muslims and did not manage to convict a single person of anything related to terrorism during his campaign  trump suggested not only monitoring mosques but added that there would need to be a  lot of systems  that extend  beyond databases  to keep an eye on muslims kobach says that he and other advisers are also looking into how to get the construction of the border wall moving without approval from congress  he says it can happen by reappropriating existing funds  but acknowledges  that future fiscal years will require additional appropriations  trump has shown us his character in whom he chooses to be part of his administration and through his actions since he has been elected  some say to give him a chance  to see how he governs  but the answer is  no   president elect pussygrabber has repeatedly demonstrated that he is completely lacking in morals  compassion  decency  and hand size it is up to each of us to oppose donald trump at every turn  to protect what we can of the progress america has made over the last fifty years  to defend our nation in every way we can against this internal enemy  recently  john oliver reminded us not to allow what we are about to live through to become normalized  keep reminding yourself this is not normal   oliver said   a klan backed misogynist internet troll is going to be delivering the next state of the union address  and that is not normal  truer words have never been spoken featured image via getty images matthew busch
