prior to the election  one of the things that trump kept harping on was how the dnc gave hillary debate questions in advance  he claimed to have solid evidence of that  and so did conspiracy sites that purported to be able to see what hillary was staring at on her podium for one of the debates  it seems  though  that trump s gripe was less than legitimate   even more so than most of his gripes throughout the campaign this kind of thing is only a problem if it could hurt him  when it benefits him  everyone should have at  but we knew that  what many probably didn t know is that the accusations he insisted on lobbing during the final stretch up to the disastrous nov   election were incredibly  amazingly  astonishingly  astoundingly hypocritical megyn kelly s new book  settle for more  details out a lot of what trump did to her during the primaries  but that s not all  the new york times  review of her book says  the day before the first presidential debate  mr  trump was in a lather again  ms  kelly writes  he called fox executives  saying he d heard that her first question  was a very pointed question directed at him   this disconcerted her  because it was true  it was about his history of using disparaging language about women  the day before   now how did he know what kelly was going to ask  we wonder  could it be that someone at fox leaked the debate questions to him  there s no other way for him to know that throughout the last  months  the accusations trump leveled at his enemies were things he himself was guilty of  following the third general election debate  he was adamant about exposing alleged treachery on the part of the dnc and hillary  his claim was that she d gotten the debate questions in advance  while he was kept in the dark  we have to ask trump   project  much   then again  projection is what he does but that s not all   settle for more also contains this tidbit  on the day of the debate  ms  kelly writes  she woke up feeling great  then an overzealous  suspiciously enthusiastic driver picked her up to take her to the convention center  he insisted on getting her coffee  though she d repeatedly declined his offer  once it was in her hand  she drank it  and within  minutes  she was violently ill  vomiting so uncontrollably that it was unclear if she d be able to go on and help moderate that evening  it was so bad that she kept a trash pail beneath her desk throughout the debate  just in case  was trump trying to poison her in advance of the debate  she doesn t say  and the new york times wisely leaves that up to the reader to determine  regardless  it s suspicious and entirely typical of a man like trump   he will stop at nothing to get revenge on his enemies  and the electoral college will put this man in the white house photo of megyn kelly by neilson barnard via getty images for hollywood reporter  photo of trump by zach gibson via getty images
