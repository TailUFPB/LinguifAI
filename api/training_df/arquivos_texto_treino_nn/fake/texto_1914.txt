investigations into russian tampering and collusion during the election were gaining steam even before trump took office  and the obama administration was worried enough about it that they took an extraordinary measure to ensure that documents specific to the probe made it into the right hands one former obama official said that they had to create a list of  document serial numbers to give to senior members of the senate intelligence committee   according to nbc news  the numbers aren t classified  nor is the existence of such a series  however  to ensure that the senate intel committee actually received the numbers  this official actually hand delivered them the numbers were intended to make it more difficult for the incoming administration to bury anything we have an attorney general who committed perjury  we have a former national security adviser who lied about his contacts with russia  we have a man in the white house who staffed his campaign with people with ties to russia  the rnc paid an intel firm that works closely with russia to dig up dirt on hillary clinton  the chairman of the house intel committee made it clear that he feels more of an obligation to trump than he does to conducting a fair  impartial and thorough investigation  the list goes on  and trump  given some of his recent tweets  is running scared besides that  the chairman and vice chairman of the senate intel committee have their hands on an unprecedented number of documents from the intelligence community relating to the probe  ordinarily  documents of this nature would not make it into a congressional investigation like this  but they have  that s probably put the fear of all the gods there are and aren t into trump s black and shriveled heart since he had proven that the word  ethics  meant zilch to him following the nov   election  it s really no wonder that the obama administration would worry about documents ending up languishing with the cia at langley  or possibly destroyed altogether  without anybody ever discovering their existence the numbers went to people on capitol hill who are authorized to view their corresponding documents photo of obama by chip somodevilla getty images  photo of trump by mark wilson getty images
