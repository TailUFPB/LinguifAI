donald trump kicked off his monday morning by tweeting something so stupid that it was necessary to check multiple times if it was a parody account  apparently  the emperor has been told he is wearing the finest of clothing for so long that he is completely unaware he stands naked  in the figurative  not the  claw your eyes out to make the awful visage disappear manner  and looking pretty stupid before us according to the donald  any and all negative polls are  fake news  and don t at all reflect the actual feelings of the millions of people who are protesting him in the streets and the millions more who are gathering to denounce him online   sorry  people want border security and extreme vetting   trump says any negative polls are fake news  just like the cnn  abc  nbc polls in the election  sorry  people want border security and extreme vetting   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february     of course  is referencing his muslim ban  which stopped people from seven muslim majority countries from entering our country  including a baby who needed heart surgery  for a time   the ban was met by widespread condemnation before a judge ultimately shut it down   at least for now  contrary to the donald s assertion  most americans actually oppose the ban  politico reports fifty three percent opposed the order  according to a cnn orc poll  with  percent arguing that it makes the u s  less safe from terrorism and  percent saying it harms american values by preventing those seeking asylum from entering the u s fifty one percent expressed disapproval with the ban in a cbs news survey  in which  percent of respondents said the ban goes against the country s founding principles  i call my own shots  largely based on an accumulation of data  and everyone knows it   trump  who posted a completely fake story on his timeline to support the ban and whose propaganda minister completely invented a massacre in an effort to sway public opinion in the donald s direction   some fake news media  in order to marginalize  lies  i call my own shots  largely based on an accumulation of data  and everyone knows it  some fake news media  in order to marginalize  lies   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    does indeed call his own shots  the ones president steve bannon doesn t call for him  anyway   but none of them are based in reality  thanks to his cozy relationship with russian dictator vladimir putin  who helped trump win the election through an aggressive propaganda campaign and hacks of his political opponents  something trump specifically requested during his campaign  and the numerous horrific actions he has taken since assuming office  trump has managed to become the most hated president in history  and americans happily let him know it daily lol fake news  fake judge  fake voting  right   realdonaldtrump  pic twitter com   david g  mcafee   davidgmcafee  february    realdonaldtrump so anything you don t like is fake  well

him he is not wearing any clothing is   like his tailor steve bannon tells him   unfit for their position and must be removed  this isn t limited to his administration  ultimately  this includes you  it includes me  it includes muslims  women  hispanics  african americans  and anyone else who largely opposes him trump is growing more unhinged before our eyes  it is up to our elected leaders to do their jobs and make sure he is not in a position to act on it for much longer   for the good of our nation featured image via getty images  joe raedle  screengrab
