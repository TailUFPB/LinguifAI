republican nominee donald trump has finally made some decisions on a few of his cabinet members if he wins the election tomorrow  and it s almost just as depressing as imagining him getting into the white house  following the theme of giving the most offensive gopers more power  trump has decided that new york city mayor rudy giuliani deserves to be his attorney general when msnbc reported on trump s list of bigot helpers  host tamron hall could barely get the words out about giuliani  when she tried to deliver the news about the former nyc mayor  she choked up and coughed  making it hard to actually complete her sentence  hall said  new this morning  trump campaign sources tell nbc news among those being considered to serve in a trump administration  rudy giuliani for attorney general  excuse me hall tried to move on and talk about newt gingrinch being chosen as trump s secretary of state  but she was already coughing  she recovered quickly  perhaps putting the shock and disgust of giuliani s new position on the back burner for now  and went through the rest of trump s choices with zero issues you can watch hall get sick to her stomach over the giuliani news below having giuliani as a major help to trump in the white house is terrifying  he s not only defended trump s racism  misogyny and other offensive comments by the business mogul  but he s also been caught lying a fairly good amount  giuliani is basically just like trump  and giving both of these idiots more power is just about the worst decision that america could make in this election  this isn t just about trump anymore   it s about the future of america  and making sure that more of these clueless gopers don t gain more influence than they already have featured image is a screenshot
