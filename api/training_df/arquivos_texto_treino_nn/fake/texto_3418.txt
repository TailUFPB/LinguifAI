if you want to know what kind of president donald trump will be  if he will execute the powers of his office in a manner that is fitting for an american president  look no further than his team s recent threats against electors who might be considering voting against our first russian installed president elect the electoral college votes on december    so while donald trump may have kinda sorta  won  the election by losing the popular vote by a historic margin  there is still a chance that he will not be our next president  unfortunately for trump  they seem to be taking the russian hacking thing seriously  demanding a full briefing before they vote  we intend to discharge our duties as electors by ensuring that we select a candidate for president who  as our founding fathers envisioned  would be  endowed with the requisite qualifications   the open letter from electors to u s  director of national intelligence   he constitution envisions the electoral college as a deliberative body that plays a critical role in our system of government   ensuring that the american people elect a president who is constitutionally qualified and fit to serve  according to reports in the washington post  new york times  and other outlets  the united states intelligence community has now concluded definitively that the russian interference was performed to help donald trump get elected  yet even today mr  trump is refusing to accept that finding   the letter continues   separate from mr  trump s own denials of russian involvement in the election  the confirmed communication between trump s aides and those associated with the russian election interference activity raise serious concerns that must be addressed before we cast our votes  this may present a problem for a guy whom the cia confirmed had a lot of help from a foreign power via hacking and propaganda  but trump s solution is simple  terrifyingly simple   threaten them into compliance  we have gotten reports from multiple people   an elector told salon under condition of anonymity   that the donald trump campaign is putting pressure on republican electors to vote for him based on       future political outcomes based on whether they vote for donald trump or not   these reports  the elector says  come from republican electors who say that violence was not threatened   instead  the trump camp threatened to ruin careers and livelihoods  it s all political  basically   the elector said   if trump becomes the president  he s going to be able to put pressure on the state parties and they won t be involved anymore  let s think about this for a moment  the expected incoming president of the united states was revealed to have been effectively installed by a foreign power after asking them to hack his political opponents  the intelligence community has confirmed that russia heard his plea for help and stepped up to get him into office  now  instead of even feigning surprise  trump is attacking and threatening anyone and everyone who says anything negative about it   the media  electors  even those same intelligence agencies whose investigations proved inconvenient for him keith olbermann recently pointed out that if trump assumes office  the chances of us ever having a free election again diminish severely  with trump now threatening those whose job it is to ensure that a tyrant like him doesn t get into office  he seems to be right featured image via getty images steve pope
