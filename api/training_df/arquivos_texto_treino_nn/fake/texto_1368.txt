last week  disgraced former fox news chief  roger ailes  died  i know you re supposed to speak reverentially about the dead  but ailes was toxic  he was a misogynist  a racist and he turned low information voters into a key demographic  without roger ailes  we would likely not have had two illegal wars and we wouldn t have blotus trump for some  though  their toxic relationship with ailes was far more personal  one notable example of a life he ruined was monica lewinsky  who  to this day  is best known as the woman who gave bill clinton a blow job  lewinsky penned her own obituary for ailes  and there was no reverence  there was resentment and a whole lot of truth  this is not another obituary for roger ailes   lewinsky wrote   who died last week  months after being ousted at fox news  it is  i hope  instead an obituary for the culture he purveyed   a culture that affected me profoundly and personally  hard to deny that  thanks to fox news  a consensual affair suddenly became the scandal of the decade   it was the story that was supposed to undo a presidency  without lewinsky  fox news might not be fox news today some experts have noted that viewers found fox for the first time because of the crisis  john moody  a fox executive editor  reflected on that period   the lewinsky saga put us on the news map   as he put it in another interview   monica was a news channel s dream come true  but amid that  fox created the culture of mean  they somehow managed to portray bill clinton as a predator  ironic given the culture at fox news  while portraying lewinsky as unworthy of a powerful man s attentions their dream was my nightmare  my character  my looks and my life were picked apart mercilessly  truth and fiction mixed at random in the service of higher ratings  my family and i huddled at home  worried about my going to jail   i was the original target of ken starr s investigation  threatened with  years for having been accused of signing a false affidavit  obstructing justice  suborning perjury and other crimes   or worse  me taking my own life  meantime  mr  ailes huddled with his employees at fox news  dictating a lineup of talking heads to best exploit this personal and national tragedy lewinsky lamented the fact that it wasn t only fox  and that fox changed the media landscape  even msnbc was committed to almost non stop coverage of the scandal that shouldn t have been  the internet  though  made it much  much worse just as television news was devolving into a modern coliseum  the internet came along and compounded this culture of shame and vitriol  remember  the story of my affair was not broken by the washington post  the new york times or the networks  but online by the drudge report  the comments on television and online were excruciating  i ceased being a three dimensional person  instead i became a whore  a bimbo  a slut and worse  just days after the story broke  fox asked its viewers to vote on this pressing question  is monica lewinsky an  average girl  or a  young tramp looking for thrills  lewinsky isn t cheering for fox news to be cancelled  in fact  she praised them for firing ailes and bill o reilly  both of whom were accused of being serial sexual harassers  she also said she believes that credible conservative voices should be heard  that it s an important part of a healthy democracy  however  ailes helped create the current cruel and toxic political environment  and for that  he won t be missed featured image of monica lewinsky via bryan bedder getty images   featured image of roger ailes via handout getty images
