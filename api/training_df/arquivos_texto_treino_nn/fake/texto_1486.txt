all americans  and indeed the entire world  should be very afraid of what is going on with donald trump s presidency  many people have voiced those concerns publicly  and one of them is former fbi special agent clinton watts on friday  watts appeared on msnbc to discuss trump s threatening tweet directed at now former fbi director james comey  and his remarks were most extraordinary  first  he addressed trump s tweet  he s threatening somebody he already fired  he would make passive threats to the fbi director via twitter before he fired him  he s saying he might taping recordings of you to use against you later  it s not the rule of law  it s the rule of trump  watts then turned to the fact that trump really doesn t seem to be running the nation at all  this is evident to anyone watching the chaos unfold on a daily basis  of course  he continued  he s obviously not working right now or in charge  he s sitting watching tv and tweeting  who is in charge of this country  this is a different level of seriousness  in terms of this tweet this morning  this is getting more and more grave by the day  trump is drunk with power and abusing it  the white house is in chaos  its spokespeople seem to have no idea what to say to the american public  everyone in the administration lies routinely to the american public  and now  most grave of all  we have this out of control president threatening the man he just fired   a man who happened to be leading up an investigation into the president himself  the firing itself seems like obstruction of justice  and the threat is even worse congress  if ever there was a time for you to do your jobs and check and balance donald trump  it s now  this man is ripping our democracy apart before our very eyes  and you re sitting by and letting it happen watch clint watts rip trump apart below featured image via video screen capture
