it s no secret that donald trump isn t a fan of wind farms  especially when they interfere with the views off his precious golf courses  trump has been at war with scotland for years over their offshore windfarms  but it s worse than simple repeated requests to scotland to not do this to him and his poor golfers  according to the guardian  trump spent years sending former first minister alex salmond letters full of insults  cajoling  and even threats in one letter  dated february     trump wrote  with the reckless installation of these  monsters  you will single handedly have done more damage to scotland than virtually any event in scottish history  you seem hellbent on destroying scotland s coastline and therefore scotland itself i have just authorized my staff to allocate a substantial amount of money to launch an international campaign to fight your plan to surround scotland s coast with many thousands of wind turbines  that s a direct threat right there  but he put a veiled one in another letter dated sept      in short  this wind farm should not be built  or alternatively  be relocated  if not  you should ask yourself if any other international developer would ever risk investing in scotland after my experience and all the promises that were made to me  another letter  addressed to phillip hammond  who was the u k  s defense secretary at the time  said that salmond had a  bloated ego   that s rich   nobody s ego is as bloated as that of king cheeto on march     he ended yet another letter pleading with salmond not to plunge ahead with ruining the views from his golf course with  i truly believe it is very important that you not destroy the beauty of scotland  its land or its seas  by placing thousands of these horrendous looking industrial structures in so many places which will ruin the magnificence and beauty of scotland  do not be the man who destroyed scotland   do not be  mad alex   he would also try and cajole salmond into caving to his demands  after saying that  the world s greatest leaders have always been those who have been able to change their minds for the good   and blasting wind power yet again  trump said  i will be your greatest cheerleader if you can change or modify your stance on at least the inappropriately placed turbines  salmond made the mistake of letting trump bulldoze away an environmentally protected area because he believed trump s promise of bringing thousands of jobs to scotland and investing hundreds of millions in their economy  the golf course only has  employees  most are part time or seasonal  there s a single story clubhouse and a small boutique hotel  and trump spend a whopping   million  trump promised a huge development with a premier hotel  trump promised a lot more than the government previous to salmond ever did  and he broke it all how s trump going to be in the white house  when other countries don t do what he wants them to do  this isn t about wind power itself   it s about trump  his ego  and his willingness to harass another country s leader in an attempt to bend them to his will salmond only responded to one of the letters  in april   it s hard to blame him for ignoring most of these because  quite simply  trump is ridiculous  salmond later warned u s  voters not to vote for trump  he noted trump s immaturity and bullying nature  and flat out called him a  man child   which  let s be honest  is true  these dealings with trump over his golf course convinced salmond that trump does not have what it takes to be president of the united states to read all of the letters in their entirety  click here featured image by jeff j mitchell via getty images
