steve bannon  trump s campaign ceo who was the editor in chief at right wing rag breitbart  apparently ordered his staff there to destroy paul ryan not too long after ryan took over boehner s mantle as speaker of the house  some of this revelation comes courtesy of michelle fields  the breitbart reporter who was thrown under the bus after she spoke out about corey lewandowski grabbing her at breitbart bannon literally directed folks to destroy ryan hes prob so happy rn seeing ryan too scared to unendorse a campaign hes running  michelle fields   michellefields  october    his part  bannon seemed to have a habit of calling ryan  the enemy  while on editorial conference calls  and even wrote an email that said  long game is ryan gone by spring  this was back in december   and now  bannon s probably thinking they should step up their game after ryan refused to campaign with trump  compared to trump and bannon  ryan is a paragon of human decency  like any decent human being  he was sickened by the leaked audio tape of trump saying his celebrity status allowed him to  grab women by the pussy  trump himself went nuts on ryan on twitter after ryan condemned him  calling him weak and ineffective  he also slammed the entire republican party for not standing by him in what his hour of need  do alpha males even have those a former breitbart employee also confirmed that bannon used to tear into paul ryan all the time  bannon  apparently  can be at least as crazy as alex jones when it comes to conspiracy theories  he had his own conspiracy theory about ryan s succession to house speaker   goes on these amazing rants  he thinks paul ryan is part of a conspiracy with george soros and paul singer  in which elitists want to bring one world government  it also includes a belief that ryan  masterminded a failed plot to bring down trump   it s difficult to get more crazy than this  but this is the man who is trump s campaign ceo of course  people who are close to both trump and bannon are framing this latest feud of butthurt as general anger with the establishment  and nothing more  that seems to be an attempt to distance trump from all the conspiracy nuts  and might be effective if trump wasn t a conspiracy nut himself this is probably why trump wanted bannon   they re two peas in the crazy pod  one of these days  these two idiots may actually figure out that they re the problem  and not everyone else  but we shouldn t hold our breath for that  bannon also said that the campaign  needs to bitch slap the republican party   if a moment of regret happens  it ll happen years in the future when they re on their deathbeds photo of steve bannon by kirk irwin getty images for siriusxm  photo of paul ryan by win mcnamee getty images  images merged by rika christensen
