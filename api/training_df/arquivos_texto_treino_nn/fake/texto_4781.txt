as you are probably aware  donald trump decided to pop into detroit for an ill advised attempt to form a false  vote getting connection with the african american community  currently  the donald is doing worse with minorities than even mitt romney did during his presidential run against barack obama  and his previous outreach efforts   telling african americans they are poor  uneducated  and have nothing to offer the world   as well as his tight connections with the ku klux klan and other white supremacist groups are not doing him any favors after trump s embarrassing  scripted interview with a detroit pastor was leaked  trump knew he had to step it up  so he went out into the community to visit the neighborhood of his former rival turned paid servant ben carson  yes  the one in which he tried to stab someone only to be thwarted by a belt buckle   cnn caught up with carson after trump left and asked him what was apparently a difficult question  we just saw mr  trump here and i asked him how did it go and he said  great   he said he learned a lot of things  what do you think he took away from today   cnn reporter jeremy diamond asked that s right   he asked carson if trump learned something from spending a few minutes around black people  this led carson to have a  rubio moment   but with luggage rather than a water bottle  carson s face twisted into a look of concern  then terror then he walked away  successfully avoiding the question how did donald trump do during his visit  not only was the church he visited virtually empty  but one woman who lives in carson s childhood home told the detroit free press that trump s visit was clearly a photo op  her takeaway from his obvious and meaningless attempt to pander to the african american community while offering nothing substantive is that people should  vote democratic  watch carson run away below https   twitter com ditzkoff status  video  image via screengrab
