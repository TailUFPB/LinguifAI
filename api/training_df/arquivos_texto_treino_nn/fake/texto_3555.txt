steve harvey appeared on  the view  and ripped donald trump a new one for whining about saturday night live instead of focusing on the presidency on monday  the ladies talked about trump s inability to ignore satire  as we all know  alec baldwin returned to portray trump in a skit in which trump repeatedly ignores national security briefings so he can post shit on twitter baldwin s impersonation apparently outraged trump  so he took to twitter to whine about it just tried watching saturday night live   unwatchable  totally biased  not funny and the baldwin impersonation just can t get any worse  sad  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    was roundly criticized for the tweet because he perfectly demonstrated that he is too thin skinned and easily provoked to be president and he instantly proved saturday night live s point that he focuses too much on twitter instead of the important issues facing our country so when steve harvey  who is also a very busy man who hosts a lot of shows  appeared on  the view   he was immediately asked to comment on trump s hissy fit harvey pointed out that saturday night live has mocked him many times but he doesn t have time to obsess with that stuff  look  do you know how many times saturday night live has done me   harvey asked   that little fat kenan talked about me  he done me like i ain t got nothin  else to do  i want to punch him in the face  yeah  but i mean  i don t have time for that  i m not even the president and i ain t got time for that  here s the video via youtube unlike steve harvey  donald trump is supposed to be preparing for the most important job in the world  america is not a reality television show where trump can just walk on set  say a few lines  and then leave until the next day  the government of the united states cannot be run like a business  there s a lot that the president has to do and deal with  all requiring different approaches  there s a reason why presidents go gray while in office  it is a stressful job and a consequential one demanding one s full attention  trump is not giving the presidency his full attention and that is dangerous  rather than playing on twitter and whining every time someone says something about him  trump should be studying up and that means actually attending the daily intelligence briefings  because ignoring those is how terrorist attacks like   get overlooked featured image via screenshot
