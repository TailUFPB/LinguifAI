christian fundamentalists all over the country are answering some kind of a  call to arms  to defend their faith from certain death  to that end  jared vallorani  ceo of liberty alliance  sent out a plaintive email to his  patriotic  followers  which contained an idea for scaring gay people straight  it s really quite simple  we want to see  million cars on our streets and highways with this emblem  we are not hiding  we are right in front of you and we will not lay down and allow any more of this foolishness to destroy our country that our fathers  grandfathers  and great grandfathers fought and died for  i want every christian patriot in america to get the star spangled fish emblem for their vehicle  can you imagine driving through town and seeing  out of every  cars with the emblem on it  he went on to say  i assure you  they will take notice  just like in any game  when the defense makes a big play  it strikes fear in the heart of their opponent  because a fish on a car is such an instrument of fear and intimidation  co opting our flag for a hate filled purpose is sooooooo totally terrifying that anybody reading this should be quaking in fear right now  even the lgbt community  especially the lgbt community  the horror of star spangled fish adorning a million cars will certainly have all non believers and sinners cowering before the christian god  begging for his forgiveness and grace  when you see that fish on someone s car  will you bow down like they expect us either the laughable idea that a silly fish emblem will scare people straight is only part of this  though  the emblems are available at patriot depot for    regular price      and patriot depot is part of  dun dun dun  liberty alliance  the exact same letter that vallorani sent out to his loyal fans accompanies this overpriced fish emblem  which is pictured below isn t that just frightening this whole thing actually begs the question  could this  call to arms  be just a way for liberty alliance to squeeze money out of their followers  coerce your loyal followers into buying an overpriced chrome sticker and reap the financial rewards  or  at least  be able to keep running your site for another day and a half this email came to joe my god through matt barber s barbwire  which is one of the many christian fundie websites that are part of liberty alliance  that  predictably  is made up of people who only want liberty for themselves also predictably  they have an astonishingly hypocritical description of themselves  liberty alliance is a network of web sites dedicated to advancing life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  given the sites listed on liberty alliance s website  including barbwire  freedom outpost  allen west republic  minutemen news  patriot tribune  girls just wanna have guns  red right republic and more  it s very  very clear that they mean  life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  only for themselves  and fuck everyone who doesn t fall in line  those people can perish in hell we ll be rolling our eyes and giggling uncontrollably the whole way down through those fiery gates  liberty alliance no doubt believes that they ve come up with a fool proof way to make money off their followers and get the added benefit of scaring the lgbt community into oblivion  their efforts will likely prove fruitless featured image via linkedin
