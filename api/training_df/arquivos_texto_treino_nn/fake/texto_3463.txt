the crew at saturday night live once again did something that will likely send donald trump   the undeservedly affluent and unstable man child to whom the  nuclear football  will be handed off in january   into yet another irrational twitter tantrum lately  the donald s cabinet picks have left many scratching their heads   someone who wants to eliminate public schools as secretary of education  a climate change denier as head of the epa  an oil drilling advocate to head up the department of the interior  and a white supremacist well anywhere  for example  to the casual observer  the expert  and anyone who doesn t want to send the country screaming into a death spiral  these may seem like nonsensical picks a rational person would not even consider   and they are   but at least the snl cast is here to make us laugh as we do our best not to think about the hellscape into which trump will do his damnedest to transform america in the next four years in the newest cold open  kate mckinnon s kellyanne conway announces trump s pick for the dea   bryan cranston s walter white  i like his style   white  who knows the dea  better than anyone  inside and out   said after the announcement   i also like that wall he wants to build  nothing comes in from mexico  meaning  a lot less competition for the rest of us   conway added that white is  actually a genius with chemicals and we re lucky to get him  it s time to make america cook again   cranston says   we want to fill this nation with red white and a lot of blue  this segment is hilarious  but it drives home a very important point  donald trump seems to be working to undermine various agencies by appointing people who are too unqualified or too evil to run them watch the cold open below
