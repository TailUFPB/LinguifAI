for years republicans have been screaming about the  takers  in our society  which to them include minorities  the middle class  and immigrants  undocumented or not but a recent expose in the new york times shows that their candidate for president of the united states  donald trump  may have used his  losses  which equate to almost   billion  to get out of  years of federal income tax payments  the self described  billionaire   who knows if that s even true   recently told the whole world that not paying taxes makes him smart  his surrogates  including rudy giuliani and chris christie  say he s  brilliant  for avoiding his tax obligations for almost  years no  morons  it doesn t make you smart  it makes you a freeloader and a con artist but besides from the glaring truth  one group in particular actually pays more in taxes than donald trump  and they re the people he hates the most  undocumented immigrants in our society  people seem to think immigrants  or  mexicans   as they blanket them   are coming into this country  sucking up our resources while paying absolutely nothing back to the society that they live in  silly republicans  that s donald trump you re thinking of according to a  study from institute on taxation   economic policy showed that undocumented immigrants pay upwards of    billion in personal income taxes  out of a grand total of   billion paid in taxes   including property  sales  other goods and services various studies have estimated between  and  percent of undocumented immigrants currently pay personal income taxes using either false social security  ssn  or individual tax identification  itin  numbers   undocumented immigrants are currently ineligible to receive the federal earned income tax credit  eitc  and state versions of the credit because they lack the legal authority to work in the u s  accordingly  the impact of state eitcs has been removed from the current personal income tax estimates  this has the effect of increasing the effective income tax rates paid by these undocumented taxpayers under current law trump  who has made demonizing hardworking immigrants a staple in his twisted  divisive and racist campaign  literally  as far as we know until he releases his tax returns  pays less than undocumented immigrants in personal income let that sink in while these immigrants are paying for our troops  military  veterans  and social programs that keep millions out of poverty  trump is skipping out   while simultaneously pretending to care about all these issues and of course his supporters are eating it up  and they campaign is neither confirming nor denying his cheating  slimy ways bottom line  donald trump contributes less  or even nothing  to our military and future generations than the immigrants he wants to cruelly deport  and that should be enough to show the american people what a fraud and con artist he really is featured image via win mcnamee getty images
