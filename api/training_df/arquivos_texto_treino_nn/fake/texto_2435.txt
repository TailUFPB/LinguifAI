the fall of professional troll and far right provocateur milo yiannopoulos continues  as he has now resigned from the place that made him a young conservative star  breitbart news  milo began his time at breitbart as a tech editor  and his antics eventually got him promoted to senior editor  now  all of that is over as multiple videos surfaced of him defending pederasty  said tapes also cost him a speaking slot at the conservative political action conference  cpac  and the deal with publishers simon and schuster for a provocative book he had written  entitled dangerous milo released a statement saying the following of his resignation  breitbart news has stood by me when others caved i would be wrong to allow my poor choice of words to detract from my colleagues  important reporting  so today i am resigning from breitbart  effective immediately  this decision is mine alone  the assertion that no one forced milo s resignation is highly suspect  considering that there was reporting that  at least half a dozen breitbart employees had threatened to walk out if milo wasn t removed from the site s employ  of course  breitbart is sticking by the idea that milo is some kind of bastion of conservative thought  rather than the walking  talking  youtube troll that he actually is  they released their own statement  saying  milo yiannopoulos s bold voice has sparked much needed debate on important cultural topics confronting universities  the lgbtq community  the press  and the tech industry  milo notified us this morning of his decision to resign as editor of breitbart tech and we accepted his resignation  milo insists that this is not the last we have heard of him  though  and says that he will be starting his own media company instead of using breitbart as the platform his filth  i will be announcing a new  independently funded media venture of my own and a live tour in the coming weeks  i don t intend to go head to head with breitbart  but i intend to do more of the same  just not under the breitbart banner  hopefully  said venture is a colossal failure now that milo is such a toxic presence to so many people  literally any outside donor  network  or media company that touches him or his effort to re brand will be immediately hit with boycotts and public scorn  and rightfully so  but   we do live in the age over saturation of news  so likely people will forget milo s controversies after awhile  he ll rise from his swamp to spew his hate another day  sad  but true featured image via video screen capture from youtube
