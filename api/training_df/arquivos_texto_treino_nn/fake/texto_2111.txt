a sit down meeting with german chancellor angela merkel went from painfully awkward to downright offensive when trump couldn t even muster an ounce of humility and grace  during a photo op  the two world leaders sat in stony silence as photographers did their best to try to capture a picture that showed some warmth between what are supposed to be two close allies  instead they got trump looking like his dad just told him they wouldn t be getting ice cream after all and merkel squirming in discomfort trump s obvious irritability was bizarre to begin with  but his refusal to interact with merkel only got worse  when a reporter suggested the pair give a handshake  as is customary when two leaders meet for the first time   merkel leaned over to trump to ask if he wanted to give it a go only to have trump continue to stare straight ahead  ignoring her  she stared in astonishment  then resignation  the realization that the president of the united states really is this pathetic was written all over her face photographers  can we get a handshake  merkel  to trump   do you want to have a handshake  trump   no response  merkel   makes awkward face  pic twitter com   david mack   davidmackau  march    could have been in a bad mood for any number of reasons  his healthcare plan is going down in flames  his budget cuts   which focus primarily on stripping funding away from the elderly and children in favor of more military spending   are getting some of the worst press since his muslim ban  his second muslim ban was just shot down by two federal judges  and his plan to accuse the british government of helping obama wiretap him didn t just blow up in his face  but actually caused an international scandal  or it could be the fact that germany has shown zero interest in indulging his tantrums whatever the cause  america just got another clear reminder that the damage trump is doing isn t just domestic  he s undermining relationships with crucial allies in ways that may take decades to repair  and he s not even willing to give a simple handshake to prevent it featured image via twitter
