republican lawmakers love using the bible to dictate their policies  they especially love using it to justify pushing spending cuts to social programs   even if it means intentionally misreading their favorite passages in texas  rep  jodey arrington decided his support for cutting parts of the supplemental nutrition assistance program needed a bit of new testament spin  how does one defend taking the food out of mouths of hungry people using the bible  by cherrypicking this quote  if a man will not work  he shall not eat  during a debate on whether or not republicans will further gut snap benefits  arrington cited the biblical verse in response to a jewish anti hunger group pleading with congress not to do something so foolish as to further dismantle food stamps  he probably thought he was being pretty clever arrington isn t the first to use the line  it s extremely popular with conservatives  so popular  in fact  that the daily kos once devoted an entire article to debunking the misinterpretation of the quote what s important to understand is working was secondary in this context  this is not so much a moral decree about work  the main message is a warning not to take advantage of the christian obligation to feed the hungry  especially if you are screwing up the church and community tasked with doing that by behaving like a twelve year old socialite in other words  the real meaning is to judge a man by his heart  not by his employment status  and as the washington post points out  in today s economy  being  unemployed  doesn t mean lazy  unmotivated  or being a leech  as the economy continues to separate between the  haves  and the  have nots   finding employment can be hard the verse in question applies specifically to people who can work or otherwise contribute to society but choose not to  said theologians from several denominations who spoke to the post  there is a perception  among some voters and lawmakers  that many adult snap recipients are exactly this sort of  freeloader  but policy experts say that is not the case  many unemployed adults on snap simply cannot work  they say  those include the mentally ill  the borderline disabled and veterans here s economist justin wolfers putting the sad reality of america s employment into a stunning graph it takes a certain kind of mind to look at these trends and conclude that tax cuts for the top   are an urgent national priority  pic twitter com   justin wolfers   justinwolfers  march    has both biblical and economic reasons to doubt his own reasoning  instead  his real ideology   the church of conservative magical thinking   led him to ignore it all in favor of more cuts to the poor to benefit the very richest in the country and as if voters needed yet another reminder of why elections matter  arrington has only been on the job two months  he was voted into office this year  he barely moved into his office and already he s going after the most disadvantaged people in his district  hats off to his efficiency  but then  institutionalized cruelty often is featured image via the washington post
