donald trump supporters thought that when they donated to his presidential campaign  they were actually receiving  make america great again  hats  books  and other merchandise actually autographed by their idol  but like so much else with trump  this was a scam too these items offered on his website  including signed hats and signed copies of his book  the art of the deal   were heavily advertised on social media and by trump himself  but what some buyers may not have realized is that it seems trump didn t actually sign any of the items available for purchase on his website with his own hand  instead  the autographs all appear to have been done by an autopen machine  a device used to automatically sign a signature the use of an autopen machine only became evident to some after trump won the election  when opportunists who had purchased such items off trump s website took to ebay to re sell what they believed would be a more valuable john hancock on ebay  the trump tribe suddenly realized that all the merchandise had been signed in the exact same identical position  impossible if he had been signing them by hand one fan told abc news   you think for    you have to be getting the real thing  had i known  not only would i not have bought this  but i m pretty sure no one would have  another told the news outlet that he would like to receive a refund after shelling out money for a fake trump autograph trump relies on a world in which people simply accept the snake oil he s selling and don t bother to actually verify what he s saying and compare it to reality  it s a formula that has worked for him for years and years  while he profits and walks away from businesses in collapse  and now he ll be running the country featured image via flickr
