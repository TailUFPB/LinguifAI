as election day approaches  the threat of violence and bloodshed is becoming more and more likely so far  the threats of a violent coup against the federal government had only been coming from a few deplorable trump supporters like dan bowman who told the boston globe last month that he is literally hoping that conservatives overthrow the federal government in the event that trump loses to hillary clinton on november   if she s in office  i hope we can start a coup   he said   she should be in prison or shot  that s how i feel about it  we re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes  there s going to be a lot of bloodshed  but that s what it s going to take i would do whatever i can for my country  many trump supporters have echoed bowman in one way or another in response to trump s dubious claims that the election is  rigged  against him and now things just escalated because right wing militias are actively preparing to join such a movement should their fellow trump supporters follow through on their threats the oathkeepers and three percent security force are right wing militia groups that have been conducting training sessions in recent weeks in preparation for a violent rebellion if donald trump loses the election right wing terrorist wannabe chris hill told reuters that his militia group is training to  save america  this is the last chance to save america from ruin   hill said   i m surprised i was able to survive or suffer through eight years of obama without literally going insane  but hillary is going to be more of the same  hill further implied that his group will act to  protect  any so called  protesters  who try to overthrow the government  which means shooting federal authorities who try to disarm them  i will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen  and prevent them from being disarmed  and i will fight and i will kill and i may die in the process   hill said   we ve been building up for this  just like the marines   he continued   we are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come  in other words  these trump supporting militias are have literally been preparing to launch a terrorist attack against the united states if the election does not go their way and it s even scarier because these gun nuts don t think they can be punished for their actions since the bundy brothers and their fellow terrorists were acquitted by a jury in what is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in american history  now right wing militias are only emboldened  if the bundys can seize a federal building and get away with it  maybe they think they can get away with overthrowing the federal government these people are a threat to our democracy and our institutions and they should be arrested before election day to ensure public safety  if trump loses he needs to grow a pair and concede  because if he doesn t he should be charged and imprisoned for any blood that is spilled as a result of his refusal to do what every other losing presidential contender has done throughout american history featured image  spencer platt getty images
