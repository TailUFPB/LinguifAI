if you haven t heard about rep  steve king s  r ia  white supremacy tweet by now  you re really not paying attention  while citing a twitter account called  voice of europe  that demonized the religion of islam  king tweeted  wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny  we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies  wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny  we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies  https   t co   steve king   stevekingia  march    saying  in so many words  the only babies needed are white babies  a classic white supremacist trope that is code for a form of ethnic cleansing it s outrageous that king has won time and time again in the  congressional district in iowa  even winning again this past november for an eighth time  it seems pretty revealing of the voting populace of that district however  there is one woman who is steadfast in defeating king and bringing sanity and decency back to the  congressional district in iowa  that woman is kim weaver  and even though king defeated her in   she never stopped fighting  and is continuing her mission to defeat him in the  midterms there is only one way she ll win  though  and that is with the help of not only those within her district  but from nationwide support  after all  congressional races affect the entirety of the united states because each representative is a vote in congress which helps determines policy for the entire nation working day and night to replace steve king in iowa s  congressional district  all help is greatly appreciated  https   t co   kim weaver   kimweaveria  september    don t just support weaver because she s battling steve king  support her because she s a great candidate  according to the des moines register  weaver works as an advocate for seniors in nursing homes  assisted living and residential care facilities with the office of the state long term care ombudsman  she also has been a medicaid case manager and a care provider for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities  so her emphasis on issues for seniors comes from working with people who struggle to pay for long term care or can t find assistance to stay in their homes she s also a single mother of three young adults  a son with an aerospace engineering degree from massachusetts institute of technology  a daughter in medical school at university of iowa and a son majoring in geology at iowa state  so her concern about burdening the next generation under a mountain of college debt comes from worrying about her own children  further  one of weaver s more creative ideas is an attempt to simultaneously address two problems  college affordability and care for seniors  she advocates creating a national volunteer program to allow high school students to earn financial credit toward future tuition  she s hoping that some of those volunteer hours might be involved with helping seniors with cleaning  yard work and other chores so they can stay in their homes  everyone seems to be treating weaver like she doesn t stand a chance  but we have the chance to help her prove everyone wrong you can help weaver by going here  and then making sure everyone else does  too  in addition  you can spread the word on social media  the good thing about congressional races is that they happen every two years  no one is safe from being ousted  no election is a sure thing  let s make sure white supremacist rep  steve king knows that he has something to worry about in kim weaver featured photo by scott olson getty images   iowa public television
