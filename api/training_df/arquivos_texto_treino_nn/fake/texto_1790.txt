the democratic wave has commenced in   republicans gloated about the tea party wave that gave them control of the house and have since been bragging about the conservative  wave  that gave them control of the senate and the white house in  but because of donald trump and his incompetence  republicans are now staring at an oncoming democratic wave that could sweep them out of power unlike the republican wave  however  the democratic wave has genuine grassroots support and it s looking more like a growing tsunami in illinois  democrats demonstrated this firsthand by taking down a bunch of republicans in local elections in places they had never won before according to the huffington post the city of kankakee elected its first african american  democratic mayor  west deerfield township will be led entirely by democrats for the first time  elgin township voted for  a complete changeover   flipping to an all democratic board  normal township elected democratic supervisors and trustees to run its board   the first time in more than  years that a single democrat has held a seat  we had a pretty good day   said dan kovats  executive director of the illinois democratic county chairmen s association   we won in areas we normally would win  but we also won in areas republicans never expected us to be competitive in  they were caught flat footed  republicans apparently thought their seats were safe and that they would be able to easily run over their opponents for victory  but that did not happen last week donald trump has done such a horrible job since taking office that even people who voted for him are seeing the light and turning on him because as it turns out  trump s policies are going to hurt conservatives more  his attempt to kill the affordable care act would have stripped millions of americans of their healthcare  trump is also launching assaults on social security and medicare  environmental protections  education  etc and it s only getting worse as trump is now close to dragging america into more wars as more fighting breaks out in the middle east and north korea makes threats trump has repeatedly proven that he doesn t give a damn about the american people  he only cares about himself and americans who never paid attention to politics before are waking up and getting involved that brings us back to the wins by illinois democrats and the rising tide that could bury republicans in  if they don t reverse course fast democrats are literally running competitive races and winning in areas that are dominated by a conservative population they should be striking fear in the hearts and minds of every republican lawmaker across the country right now  because if democrats can win here  they can win anywhere and even republicans in the most staunchly republican stronghold are not safe these may have been just some local elections but grassroots efforts are the tip of the spear at the state level  republicans have also been struggling to keep long held seats  a kansas special election almost turned into a win for democrats if not for a last minute flood of cash into the race by the republican party and democrats in georgia are running a winning anti trump campaign that could give them another seat in the house that had traditionally been held by the gop republicans also got their asses handed to them in delaware by a democrat running a similar campaign in short  trump has poisoned the republican party and republicans only have themselves to blame  they picked trump to be their leader  and he is now the face of their party  everything he does reflects on them and the american people are incredibly angry about what trump has been doing to our nation over the last three months  he has made us a laughingstock around the world however  republicans won t be laughing when the  election rolls around  they ll be devastated  and so will donald trump  because a democratic wave in  means he s likely to be a failed one term president featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
