a billionaire gop donor is fed up with donald trump and he s fed up with republicans in congress who refuse to do anything about trump  now he has a very strongly worded message for congress   he wants them to do something about the monster in the white house or he ll stop writing them checks  in fact  it might be too late florida cuban american billionaire mike fernandez is disgusted by trump and in an interview posted on thursday by politico  he expressed  shall we say  frustration at republicans who  balls  to impeach trump  all the republicans who hide behind the flag and hide behind the church  they don t have the f  balls to do what it takes   fernandez told politico florida in a telephone interview on thursday fernandez has long been a huge supporter of republicans  especially at the state level in florida  he supported mitt romney  florida governor rick scott  jeb bush and several others  but he s no longer a republican because of trump  in   he spent    million in an effort to defeat trump  i am out of the political process  too disgusted  too expensive  too supportive of ego maniacs whose words have the value of quicksand   he wrote in an email to a republican fundraiser seeking political contributions  it is demoralizing to me to see adults worshipping a false idol  i can t continue to write checks for anyone   he said   i know what it s like to lose a country  it gets worse  fernandez called trump one of the worst words in the english language   for forced birth republicans  he called trump an  abortion of a human being  if i was the doctor and knew what that baby would do  i d have made sure it never would have seen the light of day   he said of the president the most interesting thing about all of this is that this might be what it takes for republicans to wake up  face it  they aren t going to grow a set of balls  to paraphrase fernandez  any time in the near future  but they will be terrified of losing their donor base billionaires  more than anyone  care about how our country is perceived on the world stage  chaos means market uncertainty  which is never a good thing for the moneyed class  if trump continues down his current path  he will soon start losing the confidence of the gop donor base  if congress doesn t do something about him  look for all of the trump sycophant members of congress to be primaried  by the people who have all the money featured image via alex wong getty images
