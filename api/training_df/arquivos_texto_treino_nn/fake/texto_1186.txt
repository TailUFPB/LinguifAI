the walls are closing in on donald trump s attorney general in the aftermath of james comey s damning senate testimony  jeff sessions quickly canceled his upcoming public testimony in front of house and senate committees this week after previously agreeing to do so the main reason sessions does not want to testify publicly is because he fears that he will be asked about  issues related to the investigation into russian interference with the  election  indeed  sessions would be asked such questions and he should be former fbi director james comey testified on thursday that he felt he could not discuss with sessions his concerns about trump trying to kill the russia investigation  you see  sessions was about to be exposed for his own trysts with russian officials  which made sessions untrustworthy  our judgment  as i recall  is that he was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons   comey recalled   we also were aware of facts that i can t discuss in an opening setting that would make his continued engagement in a russia related investigation problematic  so now what would have been a public hearing for all to see will now apparently take place in the shadows as sessions is preparing to speak privately with the senate intelligence committee instead clearly  sessions is panicking in the wake of comey s testimony  he got caught committing perjury during his confirmation hearing earlier this year when he failed to disclose several meetings he had with russian officials during the  campaign  including a meeting with sergey kislyak  the same russian official whom disgraced former national security adviser michael flynn repeatedly met with and spoke to during the transition  an act he lied about and for which he was fired sessions might as well resign in disgrace now while he has a chance  if he can t man up and face questions about russian interference in the  election then it is obvious that he has something to hide and he doesn t want to lie about it in public for all to see featured image via shawn thew pool getty images
