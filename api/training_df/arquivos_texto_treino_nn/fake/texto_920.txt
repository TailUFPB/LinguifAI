republicans were crossing their fingers that donald trump s visit to europe would go better than the last time  but the fates were not on their side  in just one day  trump became a laughing stock over a failed handshake with poland s first lady and told the polish people that the horrors they suffered during wwii were just  tough  he also managed to piss off the leaders of poland s jewish community by snubbing the warsaw ghetto memorial visiting the memorial is a time honored tradition when u s  presidents visit poland  but trump decided he would just skip it  the warsaw ghetto memorial honors the  jews who lived in the ghetto and fought the nazis in the warsaw ghetto uprising when they came to drag every resident of the ghetto off to concentration camps in  while trump didn t bother to visit the memorial dedicated to the jews that fought  he did find time to visit the warsaw uprising monument  which honors the polish resistance fighters who fought the nazis in   rather than the jewish fighters from the ghetto leaders of poland s jewish community were not amused with trump s decision to omit the warsaw ghetto memorial from his itinerary  a scathing statement signed by anna chipczynska  president of the jewish community of warsaw  les aw piszewski  president of the union of the jewish communities in poland  michael schudrich  chief rabbi of poland  reads ever since the fall of communism in   all us presidents and vice presidents visiting warsaw had made a point of visiting the monument to the heroes of the warsaw ghetto  they did this in the name of the american people  who had played such a central role in bringing down fascism  and in that of the universal commemoration of the victims of the shoah  and condemnation of its perpetrators  that people of all nationalities and religions express  for the jews of poland  rebuilding in a democratic poland their communal life  after the horror of the shoah and the devastation of communism  this gesture meant recognition  solidarity and hope  we deeply regret that president donald trump  though speaking in public barely a mile away from the monument  chose to break with that laudable tradition  we trust that this slight does not reflect the attitudes and feelings of the american people ivanka trump  who is jewish  did visit the memorial and laid a wreath at the site it was a deeply moving experience to be able to visit the monument to the ghetto heroes and the polin museum of the history of the polish jews  it was a privilege to be able to pay my respects and remember with gratitude those who fought with such tenacity against all odds   potusinpolanda post shared by ivanka trump   ivankatrump  on jul    at   pdt but ivanka s visit did little to soften the blow of this perceived slight  particularly after the blatant anti semitism he and his administration have shown from the very beginning snubbing the memorial apparently wasn t enough for trump  he just had to make things a little worse  in his speech  trump included the warsaw ghetto uprising in his list of the  evils beyond description  that the polish people suffered through during wwii  this prompted chelsea clinton to call him out on twitter wait  what  surely trump meant the warsaw ghetto  way station to treblinka death camp  was  evil  not the uprising against the nazis  surely https   t co   chelsea clinton   chelseaclinton  july    on hitler and stalin invading poland   that s trouble  that s tough   pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  july    hope of trump not making more enemies while on his second international trip just went out the window  with a thud featured image via moshe milner gpo via getty images
