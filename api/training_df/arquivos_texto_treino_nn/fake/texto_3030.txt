missouri  in an attempt to make their state capitol building safer  has put into place security measures they didn t have before  however  it appears there s a problem  a nonexistent problem  but a problem nonetheless  it seems that people can t carry their guns into the statehouse  what to do  what to do  won t someone please think of those poor people it turns out that rep  nick marshall is quite the  amendment freedom fighter  and he has a solution to this less than real problem  he ll simply let anyone with a ccw borrow a gun from him if they want yes  seriously  he actually stuck a sign on his door that reads   attention  any constituent with a ccw that was refused to carry into the capitol may borrow a firearm from representative marshall for the duration of the visit  i can t believe one of my colleagues would actually put this on their door  smh     moleg pic twitter com   randy d  dunn   morepdunn  january    also posted it to his facebook page what could possibly go wrong marshall is angry about the new security measures at the statehouse  where once people were able to enter and exit without going through security  now they have to go through metal detectors and put their belongings through x ray scanners  elected officials may still carry concealed weapons  along with their staffs  but not the general public of course  every  amendment warrior in all of existence hates this kind of thing  including marshall  because freedom and liberty and stuff  another facebook post of his on this issue says marshall and other gun nuts don t actually give a damn about the safety of the people around them  democratic rep  stacey newman said exactly that in her reaction to marshall s sign   greatly disturbed by rep  marshall s offer to give guns to his constituents in the state capitol  purposefully averting our new security restrictions and endangering everyone in the building  including legislators and staff  i am appalled that even my personal security is of no concern to my colleague  no doubt marshall would say that he is concerned about her personal security  and the personal security of everyone in the building  which is why he will loan guns to anyone with a ccw that lost their weapon at the security checkpoint never mind that more access to guns tends to mean more shootings  whether they re intentional or accidental  the  good guy with a gun  myth is too powerful for these  amendment warriors  though  and they willfully put people in danger  marshall is a complete idiot for this featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet
