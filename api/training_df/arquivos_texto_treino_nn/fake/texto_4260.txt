donald trump seems to be willfully ignorant when it comes to a russian cyber security threat  he displayed this once again during the second presidential debate trump stated that he didn t know whether there was russian involvement in regards to hacking and the election  but that s an outright lie  u s  intelligence has been briefing him on this very subject according to nbc news  a senior u s  intelligence official assured nbc news that cybersecurity and the russian government s attempts to interfere in the  election have been briefed to  and discussed extensively with  both parties  candidates  surrogates and leadership  since mid august   to profess not to know at this point is willful misrepresentation   said the official   the intelligence community has walked a very thin line in not taking sides  but both candidates have all the information they need to be crystal clear  thus proving  without a doubt  that trump either has amnesia or willingly lied during the debate regarding cyber security and russia during the debate trump professed  i notice  anytime anything wrong happens  they like to say the russians are    doesn t know if it s the russians doing the hacking  maybe there is no hacking  but they always blame russia  and the reason they blame russia because they think they re trying to tarnish me with russia  i know nothing about russia  trump literally brought it back to himself that hillary talking about russia s hacking is all about him  he needs to realize that hillary brought it up to express the very critical point of increasing cyber security  you know  like an actual leader in fact  going beyond the intelligence briefings that he is undoubtedly privy to  the u s  intelligence community made this statement public for all of us to know  the u s  intelligence community  usic  is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of e mails from u s  persons and institutions  including from u s  political organizations  so  this begs the question  why is trump either ignoring this issue or trying to protect russia hillary brought up the fact that trump may have russian business ties  but we wouldn t know because he won t release his taxes  trump has already boasted how much he loves russian president vladimir putin  and this blatant lie during the debate definitely seems suspect in fact  according to the washington post  there is strong evidence that trump s businesses have received significant funding from russian investors  most notably  trump s son donald trump jr  made that very claim at a real estate conference in new york in   saying  russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets   donald trump jr  added   we see a lot of money pouring in from russia  which leads many to believe that trump s business ties may be the reason for his willful ignorance when it comes to cyber security and russia we would definitely know more if the republican candidate released his taxes  however  knowing they ll likely be damaging  he ll probably keep those pretty close to his orange chest watch this report via nbc news regarding the hacks featured photo by win mcnamee getty images
