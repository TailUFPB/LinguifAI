alabama is a notoriously deep red state  it s a place where democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections  however  that is just what happened on tuesday night in the special election to replace senator jeff sessions  doug jones  the democratic senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the ku klux klan members who bombed a church during the civil rights movement and killed four little african american girls  will be the next senator from alabama  cnn has just called the race  as there seems no more gop leaning counties out there to contrast  roy moore had been twice removed from the alabama supreme court as chief justice for violating the law  and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls  despite all of that  though  the race was a nail biter  because moore has a long history and a deep base in alabama  of course  decent people   including republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like roy moore going to the senate  despite the allegations of sexual predation  moore also had said many incendiary things  such as putting forth the idea that muslims shouldn t be allowed in congress  that homosexuality should be illegal  and that america was great when slavery was legal  and that s just for starters  too thank you alabama  for letting sanity prevail in this race  oh  and a message to democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere  get a fifty state strategy going so we can blow the gop outta the water in  featured image via justin sullivan getty images
