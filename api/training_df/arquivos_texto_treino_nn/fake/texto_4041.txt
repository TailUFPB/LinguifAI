republican nominee donald trump usually incites violence against his protesters  as well as women and minorities  but last night he went after one of america s most beloved politicians   our current vice president  joe biden at a florida rally  trump threatened biden because he d dared to criticize trump s disgusting  locker room talk  and comments about women  of course  trump s only answer to anything is violence  trump shouted  did you see where biden wants to take me to the back of the barn  i d love that  i d love that  mr  tough guy  you know  he s mr  tough guy  you know when he s mr  tough guy  when he s standing behind a microphone by himself  and of course  the man baby then complained that he s going to be held to an unfair standard by saying that  if i said that  they d say he s violent  how could he have done that trump had been responding to biden s comments earlier this week  when the vice president blasted the business mogul s misogynistic behavior and history with women  biden s exact words had been  i wish we were in high school and i could take him behind the gym  biden further clarified that remark and made sure that everyone knew that physical violence is not how you handle disagreements when you re an adult but since trump barely has the maturity of a high schooler  a brawl is a perfectly reasonable way for him to solve an argument  you can watch trump challenge biden below featured image via steve pope   getty images
