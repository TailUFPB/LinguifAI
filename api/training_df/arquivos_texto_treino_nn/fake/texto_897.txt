a couple of weeks ago  donald trump s voter fraud commission requested that each state provide a list of data on registered voters   all to combat phantom voter fraud fortunately  the vast majority of states have refused to cooperate at all  and even the handful that has agreed has refused to fully comply with the request  which included names  addresses  birthdays  party affiliation  last four numbers of social security numbers and voting history for the last  years democrats have seen states  refusal as a victory  but it s possible that even without the information  trump and republicans have won  voters  concerned about the integrity of their private information  are being scared off and we have proof in colorado  one of the states that is complying with part of the commission request  two clerks have seen a significant increase in voters withdrawing their voter registration  denver s abc affiliate reported in denver  one clerk has seen a   percent increase in people withdrawing as voters over the past since july  compared to the first non holiday week before colorado allows voters to withdraw online or make their information confidential by paying a fee while there s no indication of party affiliation  and you can be sure that many were  in fact  removing duplicate registrations  it s not illegal to forget to take yourself off a voter registration when you move  but it is illegal to vote twice  which almost never happens  it s not a big leap to assume that democrats would be far more concerned about the republican in office than would republicans it has gotten to the point where republicans can only win on a national basis by cheating and they are getting better and better at it every year  in   it s clear that hillary clinton would have won if not for voter suppression efforts that targeted the all too important swing states think progress reports their systematic disenfranchisement was intentional and politically motivated  in the years leading up to   republican governors and state legislatures implemented new laws restricting when  where  and how people could vote laws that disproportionately harmed students  the poor  and people of color  in several instances  lawmakers pushing such policies said explicitly that their goal was suppression of voters who favor the democratic party three such states serve as case studies for the effectiveness of these voting restrictions  wisconsin  north carolina  and florida all three elected staunchly conservative governors during president obama s terms  all three implemented voting restrictions that affect millions of people  president obama won all three states in   and won all but north carolina in   while hillary clinton lost all three of those states this year colorado is also a swing state  hillary clinton won in   but by a fairly slim margin  state races are even tighter  it wouldn t take a lot of voters dropping out to sway the next election  it may have already been done featured image via mark wilson getty images
