with donald trump late on implementing the new sanctions against russia  he knew he had to spring into actions  did he do his job  no  did he implement the sanctions like a big boy  nope  what he did was close the office that coordinates said sanctions  foreign policy reports secretary of state rex tillerson eliminated the coordinator for sanctions policy office  which had been led by a veteran ambassador rank diplomat with at least five staff  as part of an overhaul of the department  former diplomats and congressional sources told foreign policy instead  the role of coordinating u s  sanctions across the state department and other government agencies now falls to just one mid level official   david tessler  the deputy director of the policy planning office  the policy planning office  which previously operated as a small team providing strategic advice to the secretary but did not manage programs or initiatives  has grown in power under tillerson s  redesign  of the department while the sanctions office was dissolved  the administration missed a key oct   deadline to implement new penalties against russia adopted by congress in august  the move reinforced concerns among both democratic and republican lawmakers that the trump white house is mismanaging the state department and undercutting the role of u s  diplomacy while the administration had time to create chaos by eliminating the sanctions office  they for some reason could not expend the effort to actually enforce the sanctions  which have been repeatedly condemned by donald trump interesting stuff  that featured image via getty images alex wong
