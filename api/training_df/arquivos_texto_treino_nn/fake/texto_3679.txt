on saturday morning  hillary clinton s campaign counsel posted a statement to medium to announce that the campaign will back recounts in pennsylvania and michigan if green party candidate jill stein follows through with reexamining the votes in those states the post was written by attorney marc erik elias  who said that the campaign had been questioning the results since the election ended  weighing different options  elias said  it should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously  we certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect hillary clinton  and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted  since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result  these have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside  with backgrounds in politics  technology and academia  twittertwittertwitterelias said that although actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology  was not found  stein s successful movement to get votes recounted in wisconsin has persuaded the clinton campaign to support the initiative  now that a recount has been initiated in wisconsin  we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides  if jill stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in pennsylvania and michigan  we will take the same approach in those states as well  we do so fully aware that the number of votes separating donald trump and hillary clinton in the closest of these states michigan well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount  but regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states  we feel it is important  on principle  to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself  echoing stein s own words about making sure that america s elections maintain integrity  elias said  we believe we have an obligation to the more than  million americans who cast ballots for hillary clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported  elias  entire statement can be read here  on friday afternoon  stein had filed for a recount in wisconsin  promising to also follow through in pennsylvania and michigan  where trump is leading by narrow margins  the deadline stein must file for recounts in those states is monday and wednesday featured image via justin sullivan getty images
