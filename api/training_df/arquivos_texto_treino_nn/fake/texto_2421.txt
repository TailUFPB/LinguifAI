anyone who respects democracy and the way this country works knows that protests and rallies are just part of what americans are allowed to do to get their point across  donald trump  of course  does not respect any type of protest or criticism if it goes against him  so he recently attacked americans who are worried about their healthcare being taken away yesterday  trump flipped out and attacked americans who were protesting against his disastrous affordable care act repeal on twitter  implying that the protesters were actually being paid off  and were part of a liberal scheme to take him down  trump tweeted it is completely disgusting that a president would insult and attack citizens like this  and the women of  the view  nailed him for it  unanimously agreeing that protesters have every right to be upset  host whoopi goldberg called out trump s lies perfectly when she reminded everyone that people actually rely on the affordable care act for life saving treatment and medication  people are not paid to do this  people are pissed off  she s absolutely right  people s lives will actually be threatened as the gop works to get rid of the affordable care act with no reasonable replacement  co host sara haines jumped in and added  i think there s a lot of pressure in d c  right now considering  trump is technically a republican and he s overseeing this party  right now people are feeling the pressure in d c  to give in  pass people  do all of this stuff  these are the people that are going to vote them back in or not  i think it s a good a real reminder that at the end of the day  their power comes from those votes  while there was a bit of back and forth between co hosts sunny hostin and conservative jedediah bila over whether or not obamacare was cost effective and useful to americans  clearly  it is   co host joy behar jumped in and reminded everyone that most of the people who backed trump didn t even know that obamacare and the affordable care act were the same thing  and that those people only hated obamacare because of their dislike for former president barack obama goldberg cut in again with some harsh criticism for trump s plan to trash obamacare completely  this has nothing to do with the affordable care act  a lot of what s happened with the insurance companies is that the insurance companies don t want to deal with this  so  we re going to punish you  so you re forced to move this  now  here s my suggestion  because it works for a lot of people  there has to be a way  as with everything  that you use stuff that works and move what doesn t   but to come in and sweep everything out seems very crazy to me  you can watch goldberg take down trump below featured image via pool and   getty images
