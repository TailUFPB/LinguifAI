now that donald trump is president and jeff sessions is attorney general  racist cops everywhere have free reign to abuse vulnerable groups of people at every turn  the latest incidence of said abuse was caught on tape by brooklyn college associate professor of sociology alex s  vitale  in which new york city police officers were seen telling a group of black students that they would use a taser on them if they didn t move away from the sidewalk  this is a definite abuse of authority  as the nypd s official rules state that tasers are not to be used on minors when the children were slow to move away from the sidewalk at the intersection of bedford and campus avenue  one of the officers said  what are you going to do about it   this apparently implies that the cops don t care about the children s rights  and would do as they please  a short time later  one cop asks the kids   do you want to ride the lightning   this appears to be slang for the use of a taser professor vitale acknowledges that the actions of the officers on the video  seem  like an abuse of authority  well  it certainly was abusive  those children were not doing anything wrong  these cops are just looking to hurt black children because they can  they should be fired and charged with criminal offenses  luckily  the kids involved in this incident weren t harmed  but  so many times  kids have wound up hurt or dead because racist  power abusing cops decided to hurt them the nypd says that the actions of the officers on the tape are going to be investigated internally  of course  that means nothing  because they are investigating themselves  they ll surely find that they have done nothing wrong  even though there is every indication  when one views that tape  that they ve done everything wrong welcome to  community policing  in the age of trump watch the disturbing video below
