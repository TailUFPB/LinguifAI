donald trump just got absolutely humiliated on twitter after he made a pathetic attempt to cozy up to minnesota democratic rep  keith ellison with a compliment trump kicked off wednesday morning with a tweet about ellison  complimenting the democrat in his effort to head up the democratic national committee  of course  no trump compliment is complete without the undeserving president bragging about himself  so trump congratulated ellison for predicting that he would win the election trump is referring to the time ellison spoke with abc s  this week  in   in which ellison weighed in on the  election  in the segment  ellison spoke up and warned americans that even though no one was taking trump very seriously  he might have a real chance of becoming the republican nominee  and might even win the presidency  ellison had said  anybody from the democratic side of the fence who s terrified of the possibility of president trump better vote  better get active  better get involved because this man has got some momentum  we better be ready for the fact that he may be leading the republican ticket  any idiot could see that ellison is actually against trump in that statement  and was trying to mobilize people to get out and vote against the former reality television star  but of course  trump is a moron and still decided to compliment ellison for saying he had a chance at winning the election it seriously backfired on him less than two hours later  ellison  who has been criticizing trump ever since the beginning of his disastrous  shameful presidency  saw trump s tweet and practically destroyed him brutal   and so perfect all at once  guess trump is going to be spending the rest of his day attacking ellison just hours after complimenting him now featured image via drew angerer and alex wong via getty images
