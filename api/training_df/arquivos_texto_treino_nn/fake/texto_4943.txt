donald trump s new campaign manager is just a few days into her role  but already kellyanne conway is having difficulty defending her presidential candidate   and is basically showing us that she is just as much of a flip flopper as trump trump s refusal to release his tax returns has become a massive talking point against him at this point of the election  with people from both parties asking him to be transparent  on sunday night  conway went on cnn to tell americans that trump would be releasing his tax returns after they were done being audited  but just seconds later  conway seemed to contradict that statement and say that the campaign had no plans to release tax returns that were not being audited cnn host dana bash had cornered conway at the beginning of the interview  calling her out by stating that before she became trump s campaign manager  she had been an advocate for releasing the tax returns  according to conway  however  this all changed when she accepted her new role  conway said  so  now that i am on the inside  i know something i didn t know then  which is  he is under audit and what that means  and he has said very clearly   and i back him up completely   that when the audit is completed  he will release the tax returns  bash reminded conway that not all of trump s tax returns were being audited by the irs   some were finished  bash asked  you mentioned the audit  according to his lawyers  the years  to  are no longer under audit  so  would you release those tax returns  conway backtracked and said   no  i would not   and then rushed to change topics and blame obama for something   just like her boss  she said  and this entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me  in the following sense  i don t think that it creates one job  gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance  particularly under the disaster that has been obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses  what i think happened   i think people are most concerned about is  how would a president trump or how would a president hillary affect their tax bill  everyday life is becoming increasingly unaffordable for americans  and they deserve the kind of relief that he laid very strongly out in his speech  ironically  conway then talked about transparency  if we want transparency  if we want specifics  the most relevant thing that people can look at is  what is his plan for their tax bill to make everyday affordability  job security and rebuilding the american economy  you can watch conway crash and burn below  following in her boss  footsteps featured image is a screenshot
