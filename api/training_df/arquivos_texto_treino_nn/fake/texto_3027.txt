the inauguration of president elect donald trump is only a week away  and many of us are still having a really hard time accepting the fact that an erratic  corrupt businessman and former reality television star will be leading the country soon trump s inauguration isn t a pleasant thing to discuss for most of us  the majority of americans want nothing to do with it  not only have most celebrities refused to perform for trump  but the parade has been shortened thanks to the lack of interest  trump s inauguration is going to be a depressing day for most americans  especially considering that the majority voted against him  however  there is one beautiful thing we should be very grateful for  and that s the fact that trump and his supporters are going to be terribly outnumbered trump s big day isn t going to be ruined merely because no one wants to sing for him  instead of being surrounded by praise  he s instead going to be greeted by an insane amount of courageous protesters  and it will be a harsh reminder that he doesn t deserve this position  and he has the lowest approval rating in modern history the numbers are staggering  it turns out  there will nine times more busloads of protesters than supporters  as politicususa reports  protesters have reserved six times more parking permits for buses     for the women s march on washington than trump supporters have requested for the inauguration   in washington  d c  stated  councilmember charles allen told  about  permits were requested for the inauguration on friday  jan    the city has received about   permits for the following day  jan    when thousands are expected to attend the women s march on washington in protest of president elect donald trump  the women s march on washington has a message for trump  his corrupt administration  and the republicans who are threatening our human rights and freedoms  in the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights  dignity  and justice who have come before us  we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore  the women s march on washington will send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office  and to the world that women s rights are human rights  we stand together  recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us  this movement is going to be a big slap in trump s face as he realizes that americans aren t going to take his sh tty policies and bigotry lying down  the majority of us are now united   against him featured image via joe raedle   getty images
