while most of america can see right through to the flaws of donald trump s policies  it s always a special moment when someone from fox news recognizes it earlier today  fox host shep smith tore trump s latest executive order apart  noting that it could actually ruin america s economy instead of help it  smith  who has been a vocal critic on trump before  expertly pointed out that trump s announcement of a  buy american and hire american  order will actually cause the cost of goods in america to skyrocket trump s new plan will review the h  visa program for foreign workers  a program that many massive companies use  pointing out that the program serves a purpose  smith explained  tech giants including amazon  apple  google  and others all hire thousands and thousand of using it  even automakers  including ford and gm  use this program to find engineers  executives for those companies argue they can t always find enough american workers with the skills needed for the specific jobs  they also claim the program encourages students to stay in the united states after school  then  smith went after trump by pointing out that even the potus himself doesn t buy or hire american when it comes to his own businesses  but the white house says the companies take advantage of those visas  that they bring in large numbers of foreign workers pay them less  and drive down wages  president trump himself has gone back and forth over this program  and as for the president s push to  buy american   opponents point out the obvious  that some of the president s own products were made from workers from about a dozen other companies  and besides  the price of everything at your walmart and your local store and everywhere else goes way up for you  smith is exactly right and brilliant for exposing trump s own hypocrisy  and for explaining to conservatives that the man they elected is not going to help america like they thought he would you can watch smith take down trump below featured image via scott olson getty images
