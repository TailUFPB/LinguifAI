donald trump has been fundraising like crazy for his re election campaign  having filed his papers the day he was inaugurated for his first term  but there s quite possibly an odd reason for his incessant begging for funds  according to reuters  he s using the money to pay for his defense team in the russia scandal reuters spoke to two people who are familiar with the situation  but they were unable to determine how much has already been spent on legal fees  federal election laws allow candidates to spend private campaign donations on legal matters  but up until now  the legal matters in question dealt with routine and mundane things such as compliance requirements and ballot access issues trump may well become the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use his donations to pay for a criminal defense in addition to routine legal matters  one of the biggest reasons that candidates shifted largely from public financing to private financing for their election campaigns is so they have greater flexibility in how they spend that money  that helps to give trump greater latitude to spend donations on his own legal defense  furthermore  since the russia scandal is something that may not have existed had he not been elected  trump and his family may well be legally free to spend their donors  dollars on russia his campaign organization currently has nearly   million  when reuters asked trump s lead attorney how the bills were getting paid  he snapped   that s none of your business  trump spent a large chunk of his campaign funding on his own properties during the  election cycle  and has been spending government money at some of those same properties  lining his pockets with public dollars  his campaign has paid one law firm jones day almost   million  some of which probably did go to help with the russia probe  jones day has also responded to inquiries related to russia  including sending documents to congress on the campaign s behalf here s the sad thing  his donors  whether they know where their money is going or not  would probably cheer their chance to help trump defeat the liberal conspiracy that is the russia probe  they think they re helping him get re elected in   so they think they re helping him defeat the great deep state witch hunt featured image via drew angerer getty images
