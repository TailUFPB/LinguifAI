a trump supporter thought he was clever when he wrote a letter to the editor of his local paper  the winchester star  criticizing  hate has no home here  signs that were popping up in his area  the signs feature the phrase written in a number of languages and should be seen as a positive thing by everyone  but trump supporters are filled to the brim with hatred  so self described   year tea partier became  triggered  and wrote an angry letter full of so much whining  that it would cause notorious white grievance princess and former blaze personality tomi lahren to scream  snowflake  for six hours in an unhinged facebook video post if a liberal wrote it natale posed a number of incredibly stupid questions he didn t expect to be answered   but then a  grader by the name of luke macannuco answered them and delivered a smackdown so hard that the tea partier might think twice about saying or writing something this stupid again  oh  who are we kidding  he won t   i read  with great interest  mr  john natale s colossal misunderstanding of the  hate has no home here  signs  natale s first mistake was claiming the signs read   hate has no place in this home    the teen s letter begins   mr  natale is incorrectly assuming that the owners of the sign are finding it necessary to state that there is no hate in their home  but  as the american flag depicted on the sign signifies  the posters are referencing the entire u s a   a country that does not tolerate hate in spite of its current leadership  those people who have chosen to place a  hate has no home here  sign on their lawn are standing behind their belief that the country should be free of hate  the teen then addressed the meat of natale s moronic writings  and it is the best thing you will read for quite some time  until you see what came after it  that is mr  natale also lists questions that have remained unanswered  so it is my duty to define his burning inquiries   question   who are the haters that you  the sign owner  are referring to   answer  bigots who are trying to take away protections for transgender students  deport refugees and build a very expensive wall to keep illegal immigrants out  which is completely pointless and not helping your cause  but i digress    question   what  or whom  do the haters hate   answer  perfectly innocent human beings who happen to be different from the haters   question   what is the evidence that there is significant hate in our community   answer  me getting called homosexual slurs by students and adults alike   question   obviously  you are so morally superior that you may declare everyone who disagrees with you a hater  side note  this first part is a statement  not a question   where  when  and how did you become the lord high decider of morality   answer  never  we just put a lawn sign down  calm down  dude this is enough to have most right wingers peeing themselves like a couple of russian prostitutes on a certain billionaire s moscow hotel bed  but our hero wasn t done as i stated previously  the signs are not talking exclusively about winchester  the signs are about the whole united states  they also aren t implying you are a hater if you disagree  where did you get that idea  also  mr  natale  if you re going to ask us to do you a favor and take the signs down  do humanity a favor and take your trump signs down  finally  if you are going to say signs exhibit  snowflake sensitivity   take a moment to think about how you are writing an angry letter to a newspaper about a lawn sign and the crowd went wild  segalmr  fuggirls  if ur going to think signs display  snowflake sensitivity    think about how you are writing a letter to a newspaper about a sign   pic twitter com   sela lewis   selanehanda  april    segalmr  aljavieera controlled burn  do not report   badlands drifter   joelvanderwerf  april    segalmr  andyrichter i love that kids have more sense than most adults these days   raz bean   razbean  april    pobbard  segalmr oh my god this letter  i love this kid   dan lyons   realdanlyons  april    segalmr holy shit epic take down  but done with class   subtlety that escapes most adults these days   pietro     april    segalmr holy  fucking  yes   manthony   matanunpa  april    segalmr obviously we elected the wrong seventh grader as president   bryan edward stone   bestonetx  april    segalmr well said  pic twitter com   elizabeth   loveylovett  april    sound you just heard  it was the agonizing scream of the last of natale s pride featured image via screengrab
