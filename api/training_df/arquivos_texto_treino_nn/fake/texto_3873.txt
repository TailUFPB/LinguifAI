russia and vladimir putin got what they wanted last night when donald trump won the election throughout this campaign  trump suggested policies that would weaken the nato alliance that has helped europe resist the threat of russian military advances for decades trump advisers have also suggested that he would lift sanctions against russia and the gop platform has removed a plank condemning putin s aggressive seizure of the crimea in ukraine  now russian is emboldened because they have someone in the white house that they can take advantage of and make no mistake about it  donald trump will be putin s puppet that s why russia is now openly bragging about helping trump win according to the guardian sergei markov  a pro kremlin political analyst  was jubilant at the result and said a trump presidency would make it more likely the us would agree with russia on syria  where the two powers back different sides and moscow has intervened decisively on behalf of the president  bashar al assad markov also said it would mean less american backing for  the terroristic junta in ukraine   he denied allegations of russian interference in the election  but said  maybe we helped a bit with wikileaks  trump s victory certainly scares russian investigative journalist yevgania albats  as it became clear that hillary clinton lost  she called the election a  disaster  that putin will use to his advantage  i cannot believe it   she said   there will be absolutely no constraints on putin now at all  this will be a disaster  indeed  and if putin decides to attack nato affiliated nations such as those in the baltics  trump has already declared that those nations are on their own if they don t bigger dues to maintain the nato alliance when asked in july is he would rush to aid these nations militarily if russia attacks  trump said  if they fulfill their obligations to us  the answer is yes  in other words  trump is willing to abandon our allies and allow russia to gain a foothold in europe over money even though every member nation contributes their fair share even ronald reagan would not have abandoned nato  nor would he have allowed russia to influence american power  but trump is poised to do just that and the kremlin rewarded him handsomely by making him president via espionage republicans should be ashamed of themselves featured image  photo of donald trump by joe raedle getty images  photo of vladimir putin by thierry chesnot getty images  images merged by rika christensen
