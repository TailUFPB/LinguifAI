this presidential election has been bringing everyone out of the woodwork to reveal their opinions on who is running  especially in regards to republican presidential candidate donald trump one person who seems to be abundantly clear about his opinion on trump is former tonight show host jay leno  sitting down with the hollywood reporter  leno revealed  in so many words  that trump needs to have some sense knocked into him  and maybe  just maybe  he d be a better person for it leno told the hollywood reporter  i think this is the problem with donald trump  i don t think anybody has just ever beaten the crap out of him  so he has this attitude of  whatever   when you have the crap beat out of you  you learn how to negotiate  you learn how to deal with people  you learn that kindness is the greatest virtue you can have i know people that say  shut the f ing door  and i know people who say  is it cold in here   if you say  is it cold in here   someone will shut the door for you  and you haven t annoyed anybody or pissed anybody off  and that s my attitude about life  just trying to be kind when you are poor it s easy to be kind  when you are rich and famous  it s not that it s hard to be kind  but it s harder because people suddenly start catering to your eccentricities or whatever it might be  and that s just the thing  trump seems to have never been in a situation in his life where he s been forced to be kind  he s so used to everyone bending over backwards to please him  that he doesn t seem to think that he actually should be kind to others in return  this would definitely explain his bully behavior  and how he feels so entitled to pretty much everything  including the white house note  this article in no way is suggesting that trump should be harmed  it is just revealing what jay leno said in an interview featured image via kevin winter getty images
