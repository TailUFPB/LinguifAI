it s looking as though republican presidential candidate donald trump is losing support even from within his own ranks  you know things are getting bad when even your top surrogates start turning against you  which is exactly what just happened on fox news when newt gingrich called trump  pathetic  gingrich knows that trump needs to keep his focus on hillary clinton if he even remotely wants to have a chance at defeating her  however  trump has hurt feelings because many republicans don t support his sexual assault against women have turned against him  including house speaker paul ryan  r wi   so  that has made trump lash out as his own party gingrich said on fox news  look  first of all  let me just say about trump  who i admire and i ve tried to help as much as i can  there s a big trump and a little trump  the little trump is frankly pathetic  i mean  he s mad over not getting a phone call  trump s referring to the fact that paul ryan didn t call to congratulate him after the debate  probably because he didn t win despite what trump s ego tells him gingrich also added  donald trump has one opponent  her name is hillary clinton  her name is not paul ryan  it s not anybody else  trump doesn t seem to realize that the person he should be mad at is himself because he truly is his own worst enemy  this will ultimately lead to his defeat and he will have no one to blame but himself watch here via politico featured photo by joe raedle getty images
