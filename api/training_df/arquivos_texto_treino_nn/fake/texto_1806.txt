whitewashing hitler and the holocaust seems to be all the rage among today s republicans  there was the time when the white house remembered the holocaust on holocaust remembrance day  but forgot to mention the jews  at all  yesterday  press secretary sean spicer said hitler didn t use chemical weapons  he s been trying  and failing  at backtracking ever since  now  a republican in north carolina  on his facebook page  compared abraham lincoln to hitler it was a comment by gop legislator larry pittman  he posted his newsletter on facebook  and among the rest of the hate  he commented this to a person telling him to  get over  the supreme court ruling that made same sex marriage the law of the land  something he hopes to overturn  at the state level  and if hitler had won  should the world just get over it  lincoln was the same sort if tyrant  and personally responsible for the deaths of over   americans in a war that was unnecessary and unconstitutional obviously  his followers let him have it  but perhaps the best answer was this one the civil war was unnecessary and unconstitutional  what on earth were you thinking  the republican party used to be   proudly   called the party of lincoln  i have no idea what to call it now  at least that could be repeated in polite company couldn t nc rep  larrypittman find someone else to compare  hitler to rather than  lincoln    maddow  ncpol https   t co  pic twitter com   indy week   indyweek  april    clearly has no idea whatsoever what the constitution says or he would not be putting forth a bill that would try to nullify federal law  that is against the constitution  now  so is slavery  although i m sure that s something else pittman would like to nullify racism is nothing new for pittman  like donald trump  he was a birther  he said this about president obama  someone had posted something  with a picture of barack obama and across it said  traitor     pittman said   and  you know  i don t always agree with the guy  i certainly didn t vote for him but i gotta defend him on this one  i just don t think it s right at all to call barack obama a traitor  there s a lot of things he s done wrong but he is not a traitor  not as far as i can tell  i haven t come across any evidence yet that he has done one thing to harm kenya  source  msnbcbut hey  this is trump s country now  it s totally cool these days to let your racist flag fly high  double points if that flag belongs to the confederacy image of hitler via bbc   image of lincoln via wikipedia
