on wednesday morning  donald trump announced that he would be launching a full scale investigation into why so many women and minorities were allowed to vote for his opponent voter fraud  including  those registered to vote in two states   depending on the results of his investigation  president asterisk says he plans to  strengthen  regulations to ensure that only white  straight men get to vote for the rest of time our elections are fair and only corrupt government officials and brutal foreign dictators have a say i will be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud  including those registered to vote in two states  those who are illegal and    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     those registered to vote who are dead  and many for a long time   depending on results  we will strengthen up voting procedures   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     trump is completely wrong about it being a crime to be registered in two states  voting in two states is a crime  but let s humor him  let s say that is voter fraud  he really doesn t have to look far at all to find someone trump senior advisor steve bannon is a lot of things  he s an anti semite  a white supremacist  a douchebag  and an alleged domestic abuser  he s also a proud registered voter in the state of new york   and in florida bannon registered to vote in new york shortly before the election and cast his ballot for trump in only that state  but he is also registered to vote at the home of a friend  andy badolato  in the sunshine state  he changed his address in florida in august  shortly after reports surfaced that he was previously registered at an abandoned house  bannon did not commit voter fraud in any way  but according to trump he is a criminal simply because he has an outdated registration in florida this must be uncomfortable for trump  whose false claims about what does and does not constitute fraud has nailed one of his senior minions  but it s likely that he will ignore it because it doesn t quite fit his narrative that millions of people voted illegally for hillary clinton  and that is why he lost the popular vote did you ever think you would see the president abuse the powers of his office to satisfy his ego and push a debunked conspiracy theory  yeah  we didn t either  but here we are featured image via getty images mark wilson
