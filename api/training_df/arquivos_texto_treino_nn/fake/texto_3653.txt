it shouldn t be surprising to anyone that trump is attacking recount efforts in wisconsin  michigan and pennsylvania  however  many people assume that he s doing so because he s afraid of the recounts proving he didn t actually win the election  that s only partly true  evan mcmullin  who ran for president as an independent  has a different hypothesis that s much worse than such a fear it should not go unrecognized that  realdonaldtrump s effort to inflate his election performance without cause is typical of autocrats  https   t co   evan mcmullin   evanmcmullin  november    do it increase the perception of their political legitimacy  while undermining popular opposition to them   evan mcmullin   evanmcmullin  november     interesting idea  and it does fit with what we know of trump s personality  so it s not a stretch to believe that fear of losing face  and anger at having his legitimacy questioned at all  is at the root of trump s attacks  it s not just the possibility that he could be proven a loser here but there s something even more insidious than showing trump has autocratic tendencies  we already know he has strong autocratic tendencies  but he also undermined our democracy by repeatedly calling the election rigged  his attempts to undermine opposition in this manner expands his attack on democracy  mcmullin points out that both of these tactics help to solidify an autocrat s power and  in the process  they do enormous damage to democratic institutions  which is a larger objective they share   evan mcmullin   evanmcmullin  november    it is those institutions and supporting norms that present the most significant check on an authoritarian s power   evan mcmullin   evanmcmullin  november    confidence in those institutions and norms has been sufficiently eroded  the authoritarian has a freer hand with which to wield power   evan mcmullin   evanmcmullin  november    s claims during his campaign that only he could fix our country  and fuck using our democratic system to try and do it because it s all rigged anyway  demonstrated his dictatorial nature  by throwing twitter tantrums over possible recounts  and claiming there was massive voter fraud even though he won  trump is trying to put us all in our places while reinforcing his image as a strong political leader who is beloved by everyone featured image by mark wilson via getty images
