after a campaign in which he shamelessly pandered to the lgbt community  donald trump has betrayed them so completely that his prior rhetoric is all but unrecognizable  he is slated to speak at the  values voters summit  on friday  hosted by the hate group family research council and their extremist president tony perkins  a man who believes that gays should be put to death the speech trump gave at the republican national convention in cleveland in july  came just one month after the deadly shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando florida  that hate crime  sometimes referred to as a terrorist attack based on the religion of the perpetrator  claimed the lives of  mostly latino gay club goers and wounded  more  it was the first time facebook s safety check feature was ever used inside the united states  with users marking themselves as  safe  to let family and friends know they were okay although witnesses at pulse said they remembered the attacker being a patron of the bar   perhaps a jilted lover  even   trump took the opportunity in that cleveland speech to make a vow to his lgbt voters   as your president  i will do everything in my power to protect our lgbtq citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology   and what did those voters look like photo by drew angerer getty imagesthey looked like kids who believed him the man who became the first republican to even mention the lgbt crowd at a national convention went on to reverse himself in every way possible he had already said earlier that year that transgender people should use  the bathroom that they feel is appropriate   at a colorado rally in october  trump waved a rainbow flag with the phrase  lgbts for trump  scrawled across the middle but all of his promises  all of his platitudes  were meaningless he unilaterally made the decision to expel transgender soldiers from the military  then lied about it  saying that he had consulted with military leaders about the issue  he revoked obama era bathroom guidelines that favored the community in public schools  he went so far as to remove the entire section on lgbtq rights from the official white house website now that trump s justice department  under the bigoted tutelage of notoriously anti gay asshole jeff sessions  has asserted that it is legal to actually discriminate against transgender employees  you d think that donald trump would make sure the statement on the white house site in which he vowed to uphold protections for them would be taken down out of shame  or at least consistency  he can t be bothered so what does it mean that trump is the very first president to speak at the values voters summit  it means that his hypocrisy has come full circle  it means that his lies are all finally exposed  it means that he is shameless enough to not only adopt religion in order to solidify his base  but to pander to even the extremist wing of that religion  even if they openly advocate for the persecution of the community donald trump once promised to protect featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
