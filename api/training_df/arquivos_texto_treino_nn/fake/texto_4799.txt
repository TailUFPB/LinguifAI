remember that time in  when donald trump rode in on a white horse and personally saved the auto industry all by himself  yeah  me neither  but one of his supporters thinks that actually happened during an interview on cnn  trump s favorite pastor  darrell scott  stunned former detroit mayor dennis archer and new day host alisyn camerota by making that exact claim after trashing the michigan city as a hellhole that only the republican nominee can fix  detroit is in bad shape   scott said   it s in bad shape economically  it s in bad shape as far as crime is concerned  and so you have a candidate that s saying   i want to improve the conditions of the city economically  i want to improve the condition of the city as far as crime is concerned    you can t turn a deaf ear to that  whoever it is  archer took umbrage to scott s characterization of the city and warned that voters should scrutinize candidates who make such promises  especially since trump didn t give a damn about detroit before his poll numbers imploded camerota asked scott to continue  and when he did he gave trump credit for something that president bush and president obama did in  and  respectively  you have someone saying   i m going to be put in a position to help detroit in the areas that it most needs help   scott went on   he bailed out the auto industry  yes  scott really did claim that trump save the auto industry at the height of the great recession of course  the record is crystal clear that president bush signed the first bailout of chrysler and general motors  when president obama took office the next year he did even more to help the american auto industry to stay alive and continue competing with foreign automakers the auto industry is now fully recovered in this country and donald trump has absolutely nothing to do with it  something scott realized moments later as he clumsily attempted to correct himself  i mean  he just  uh  he didn t bail out the auto industry   scott embarrassingly admitted   what i m saying is  he had been working in relationship with the auto industry in order to stimulate the american auto industry  here s the video via twitter heated debate over donald trump s outreach to black voters https   t co   new day   newday  september    again  a trump supporter humiliates himself on national television by getting the facts completely wrong  at least scott had the decency to correct himself this time featured image  getty images
