donald trump has often campaigned as the self described  law and order  candidate in the  presidential election  but one of the men trump tried to persecute is speaking out against the reality tv star as recently as last week  trump argued that the central park five should be behind bars  the men were five young black men who were railroaded by the criminal justice system and falsely accused of raping a white woman  known as the central park jogger   eventually  after they were imprisoned  another man was connected to the crime via dna evidence and the five were released  they received a court judgment and were rewarded monetary damages for their unjust incarceration trump took out a full page ad during the trial  calling for the boys  execution  now  one of those men  yusef salaam  is speaking out about trump and his incitement and what salaam describes as  calling basically for us to be murdered  yusef salaam said donald trump s infamous full page ad calling for the deaths of the central park five would in an earlier era been the impetus that sparked  mob justice    in a new ad against trump  they had our names  our phone numbers and addresses in the papers so what would ve happened  somebody from the darkest places of society would ve come to our homes  kicked in our doors  and drug us from our homes and hung us from the trees in central park  that would ve been the type of mob justice that they were seeking  trump still refuses to accept that these men are innocent  part of a troubling pattern from the republican nominee in a blas  attitude towards black concerns and safety  asked during the debates about police brutality against blacks and the protests of the black lives matter movement  trump has instead gone at length about  stop and frisk  and inner city crime  it is his go to position and rhetoric when speaking about black people featured image via screen capture
