history is once again being made thanks to president obama  on wednesday  obama nominated abid riaz qureshi to serve as a judge on the u s  district court for the district of columbia  filling the vacancy left by judge rosemary collyer  who took senior status  qureshi s nomination makes him the first muslim to be nominated for a federal judgeship and  if confirmed  the first muslim federal judge in american history with a commitment to serve the american people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice   as president obama said  qureshi is a graduate of cornell university and harvard university and currently works at the law firm latham   watkins llp  qureshi specializes in healthcare fraud and securities violations not only is qureshi a partner at latham   watkins  a position he s held since    he is the global chair of the firm s pro bono committee  and serves on the legal ethics committee of the district of columbia bar an accomplished lawyer  who happens to be muslim  will not get his day in the senate  should the obstructionist republicans allow it  and make history and of course conservatives are going to be furious when they find out that   gasp   muslims can serve in public office  fortunately to sanity and justice  the united states constitution has a no religious test clause under article vi   but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states so say the founders  who seemed to be very cordial and accepting of muslims the united states constitution has this clause to ward off hateful bigots who think their religion is the only one that matters  and president obama is taking full advantage of it  and rightfully so  qureshi isn t qualified because he s a muslim  he s just a qualified attorney who happens to be muslim here s to hoping history will once again be made  and republicans will give this man a fair hearing and a speedy up and down vote featured image via mark wilson getty images
