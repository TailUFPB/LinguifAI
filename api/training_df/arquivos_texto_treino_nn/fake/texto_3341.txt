when the affordable care act was in deliberation  republicans showed themselves at their most heartless  essentially  their view is that healthcare is not a right and should only be available to the people who had the foresight to be born into a wealthy or near wealthy family despite the fact that overall  obamacare has been wildly successful  even with republicans putting up every obstacle possible  about  million people have health insurance and would lose it without the affordable care act  republicans don t care  one republican  though  has a solution  but there are two small problems  it s not a solution at all and it s tantamount to child abuse in an interview with mlive com  rep  bill huizenga  r mi  regaled the reporter with a story of how he waited a night to take his son to the doctor  when his son had a broken arm  somehow  huizenga thinks that s a good thing  we weren t sure what was going on  it was in the evening  so i splinted it up and we wrapped it up  and the decision was  okay  do we go to the er  we thought it was a sprain  but weren t sure   huizenga said  adding that he and his wife  took every precaution and decided to go in the next morning  when it  those type of things  do you keep your child home from school and take him the next morning to the doctor because of a cold or a flu  versus take him into the emergency room  if you don t have a cost difference  you ll make different decisions   he said here s the video yes  that s the republican line  people should shop for healthcare  of course  that s possible with some procedures  but for most  it s not at all  besides  have you ever tried to pin down actual costs for medical procedures  it s not easy  hospitals and doctor s offices aren t exactly known for offering full disclosure when it comes to pricing  many people in this country aren t lucky enough to live in areas where there is even competition beyond that  though  waiting to treat a broken arm so you can save a few bucks is child abuse and for those who don t have health insurance  there s often no option but to go to the emergency room featured image via video screen capture
