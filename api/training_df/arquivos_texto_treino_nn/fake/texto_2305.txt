you remember that one company that used to stuff your mailbox full of coasters installation discs every single goddamn day of the week  your only reprieve from the madness being sunday  well  america online finally discovered what it takes to be relevant  apparently mike pence uses it on thursday  the indianapolis star revealed that not only did the vice president use private email   something for which donald trump s opponent  hillary clinton  was demonized   but he conducted state business on an insecure  almost forgotten service that was presumed dead long ago  unlike hillary clinton s private email server  pence s aol account was hacked clinton was spotted on a flight from boston to new york on friday and a passenger managed to catch the very moment the former secretary of state saw the usa today headline about pence s private email  the passenger sent the photo to friends via snapchat  and one of them saved it to share with the world   hillary just checking the daily news   pence used personal email in office   the irony is palpable  pic twitter com   pere noel     march     what in the fuck   look on hillary s face is priceless  it s ok  we know what she s going through  we watched the right froth at the mouth over what ted cruz would call a  nothingburger  if clinton was a republican for what seems like forever it is not against the law to use a private email in indiana  but officials are expected to retain the exchanges to fulfill public records requests  documents released  via  a records request shows us that pence discussed national security and other matters with his top advisors via his private email  but an unspecified number were withheld because   the state considers them confidential and too sensitive to release to the public  once again  these are from an account that was hacked last summer  the star notes that the scammer  sent an email to his contacts claiming pence and his wife were stranded in the philippines and in urgent need of money   he responded not by increasing his security  but by creating a new aol screen name we will not be seeing calls to  lock him up  from the right  nor will we see gop politicians calling for endless hearings and investigations  normally  this would be fine but at this point there seems to be one set of rules for democrats and one for republicans in an administration that is easily outpacing even the accusations they leveled at clinton this photograph serves as a reminder of what americans who knew better but decided that voting their  conscience  was more important than literally saving america from a despot and people who are too stupid to operate a fork without adult supervision yet figured out how to vote caused us to lose  we could have had a competent leader who isn t perfect  but she was at least smart enough to warn us about donald trump s cozy relationship with vladimir putin  and  of course  she isn t a walking human rights crisis it s heartbreaking featured image via twitter
