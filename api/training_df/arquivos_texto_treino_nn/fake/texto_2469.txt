trump and his staff are so sure the media lies about everything that they ve put together a  media accountability survey  designed to gauge how people feel about the media  how they re representing trump and republicans  and numerous other things  of course  because true scientific polls don t ever tell them what they want  this survey is anything but scientific  they want to feed their confirmation bias  but what s really happening is hilarious and it s made trump call his own poll rigged seriously the email that was sent to supporters asking them to take the survey again reads the president emailed you to take the urgent mainstream media accountability survey since then  mainstream media outlets have viciously attacked it and thousands of democrats have taken it to try to sabotage the results which is why we need your immediate help as one of president trump s biggest supporters please take the mainstream media accountability survey now   thanks team trump not only does this email demonstrate that trump is only interested in answers from people who think the exact same way he does  but it also demonstrates the sheer desperation on trump s part to prove that the media is engaging in one giant conspiracy to bring him down  or something the questions in the survey are leading and biased  and were definitely not crafted by an experienced pollster  he wants specific answers and the questions are worded so he s more likely to get those answers     and those are just a sampling of the questions in the survey at the end  it asks you for your name  email address and zip code  but there s no verification on it  so you can make up a name and email address  and pick a zip code  any zip code  and you don t have to create dummy email accounts for it either   so really  what did they expect to happen here after you fill it out it takes you to a donation page  because of course it does the bottom line is that  unless he gets the results he s looking for  he s going to keep crying  rigged  if you d like to see what s in it  it can be found here  if you d like to take it for yourself  repeatedly featured image by sean rayford via getty images
