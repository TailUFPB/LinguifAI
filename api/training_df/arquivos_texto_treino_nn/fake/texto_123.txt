long before cara mund   miss north dakota   won the  miss america pageant  she faced a crowd of  other young women  all competing in various categories for the coveted crown  two of those categories  to most of our readers  are patriarchal and silly  the evening wear and swimwear  competitions  pit all these beautiful young women against one another for assessment on their looks by a panel of judges the other two categories  however  can be quite interesting  especially when something happens like what went down with miss texas in this year s competition the talent portion of the show is  of course  just plain entertaining  perhaps you ve seen the movie miss congeniality  starring sandra bullock  and if you have  you know what i m hoping to see in a talent show  the real thing is very little like that  however  and so is the interview portion of miss america  source  meme central  a folder on my computertonight  miss texas was no miss rhode island  there were two rounds of questions this time around  and when margana wood was called on for the second  more serious question  she got a doozy  drawing a judge s name from a dish  she pulled jess cagle  the editor in chief of people magazine  cagle wasted zero time getting right to it  last month  a demonstration of neo nazis  white supremacists  and the kkk in charlottesville  virginia turned violent and a counter protester was killed  the president said there was shared blame with  quote   very fine people on both sides   were there  tell me yes or no  and explain  well  then  that s a far cry from every participant simply answering  world peace   whenever their turn came around to say the one thing to the world they had in their heart  ms  wood was not  as they say  f cking around  barely containing her anger  margana turned it up to   i think that the white supremacist issue  it was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack  and i think that president donald trump should have made a statement on it earlier  addressing the fact  and making sure all americans feel safe in this country  that is the number one issue right now  naturally  republicans were butthurt  here s a summation of all the cleverest things they came up with in response  missamerica pageant should be renamed  miss liberal america  pageant  kurt   kmgindy  september     we re gonna need to call the burn ward  just kidding  go f ck yourself  kurt watch the amazing exchange here miss texas was asked if trump handled charlottesville badly  she  uh   didn t play      missamerica pic twitter com   shauna   goldengateblond  september    image via donald kravitz getty images
