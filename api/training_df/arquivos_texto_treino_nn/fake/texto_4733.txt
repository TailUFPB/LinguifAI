a new ad by the hillary clinton superpac priorities usa was released on tuesday  it s perhaps the most frightening of all because it directly quotes trump saying   i love war   and specifically  he loves nuclear war here s the ad factcheck did their due diligence with the ad and the biggest complaint they could find is that the direct quotes from trump came from two different times  still  here are his entire quotes trump  nov      this is the trump theory on war  but i m good at war  i ve had a lot of wars of my own  i m really good at war  i love war  in a certain way  but only when we win and then the second half  a few months later he talked about nukes trump  it s not like  gee whiz  nobody has them so  north korea has nukes  japan has a problem with that  i mean  they have a big problem with that  maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from north korea wallace  with nukes trump  maybe they would be better off   including with nukes  yes  including with nukes so  now that we ve confirmed that yes  trump does love war  how is his campaign going to spin that trump campaign manager kellyanne conway appeared on good morning america on wednesday and it was clear she was out of her league  even though most of the questions weren t that hard hitting at first  she deflected conway responded that what is actually  irresponsible  is  taking little  cherry picking little snippets of what he said and not giving the full context of the sentence let alone the speech  this woman was secretary of state for four years  and i think the reason she s struggling in the polls part is because aren t really fond of that record and she will be held account for that record   conway said  ripping into clinton over her recent polling troubles   she s actually been in control of many aspects of our national security and our troops and our defense and i think that given all of her advantages  including her super pac including her campaign hang spent over   million most in paid advertising one wonders why is she not at    percent in the polls  why isn t she at    percent among women  hillary clinton has a hillary clinton problem  source  politicowhen pressed further  she still had no explanation  i d have to see the entire snippet there but obviously many commanders in chief have made the very difficult decision to go to war   conway responded   you have hillary clinton as secretary of state calling a russia reset that didn t work  she was wrong on libya  she was wrong on syria  she was certainly wrong on benghazi and i think they ll both be held to account for that  here s her spin  abc breaking news   latest news videosthe fact is that trump does love war and he has no concept whatsoever of the ramifications of his actions  in a national security briefing  trump asked three times why we can t use nuclear weapons  if you aren t frightened by trump s racism  sexism or xenophobia  please be frightened by the fact that he has complete disregard for the damage war  and in particular  nuclear weapons  can inflict  be frightened over his dangerous stupidity featured image via alex wong getty images
