in what can only be described as a proof of life video  former house speaker newt gingrich is seen backtracking wildly away from a previous remark where he stated  drain the swamp  was no more than a catchphrase used by trump and he didn t really mean it  drain the swamp was how trump said he would get rid of politics as usual in washington dc as you can see here  trump seems very mad someone incorrectly stated that the phrase  drain the swamp  was no longer being used by me  actually  we will always be trying to dts   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    was at almost the exact same moment when gingrich released this video where he said  i want to report that i made a big boo boo  i talked this morning with president elect donald trump and he reminded me  he likes  drain the swamp    i miscategorized it the other day  he intends to drain the swamp  he even describes it as dts   so i want all of you to know that i goofed   draining the swamp  is in  alligators should be worried  and you ll hear me write more about alligators and the swamp  but i thought i owed it to all the folks who follow me  when i make a mistake  i m going to be straight forward and tell you  i blew that one  draining the swamp is in  president elect trump wants to do it  and you re gonna get to be part of it  watch the video here i goofed  draining the swamp is in   realdonaldtrump is going to do it  and the alligators should be worried   dts https   t co  pic twitter com   newt gingrich   newtgingrich  december    looks terrified and it makes one wonder   what the hell does donald trump have on newt gingrich that would make him put together this really bizarre video there s no one more establishment in dc than newt gingrich  and the fact that he s sucking up to donald trump who claims he wants to  drain the swamp  is really  really weird  we ve seen trump s picks so far and they ve been big business as usual  and gingrich clearly wants to be part of that however  this video makes it pretty clear that trump has gingrich under his thumb  and the former speaker looks mortified featured image via video screen capture
