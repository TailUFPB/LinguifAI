it s black history month and before tuesday  donald trump s only acknowledgement seemed to be telling a female african american reporter to set up a meeting with the congressional black caucus  you know  because black people all know each other and working women are all secretaries on tuesday  though  trump finally visited the african american history section of the smithsonian  he delivered some platitudes  but he also took the opportunity to brag about himself and his win and he complained about the cost of the museum first  the not so horrible  it s a privilege to be here today   trump said at the museum   this museum is a beautiful tribute to so many american heroes  heroes like sojourner truth  harriet tubman  frederick douglass  booker t  washington  rosa parks  the greensboro students and the african american medal of honor recipients  among so many other really incredible heroes  source  talking points memotrump also made a vow to  fight bigotry  intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms   of course  he could say that to his supporters rather than to victims of  bigotry  intolerance and hatred   but still  the sentiment  sincere or not  it wasn t   was there it didn t take long for trump to start in with his usual bragging  though trump also thanked sen  tim scott  r sc  for joining him at the museum  a friend of mine  a great  great senator from south carolina  i like the state of south carolina   he said   i like all those states where i won by double  double  double digits  nothing earth shattering there  trump loves his winning states and hates the states that dared exercise their democratic right to vote against him  it was the last part that hasn t been reported much in the media  but was particularly eye opening he wrapped up his speech by saying that the museum was built with  tremendous love and passion   not to mention  lots of money  i just have to say that what they ve done here is something that can probably not be duplicated  it was done with love and lots of money   trump said   lots of money  we can t avoid that  to be fair  the museum did cost about   million   half of it paid from private donors  as for the taxpayer funded portion  it only represented about   percent of the federal budget  it s also approximately the cost of us sending the trumps to mar a lago every weekend for about two years featured image via pool getty images
