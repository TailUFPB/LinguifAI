in a brand new expos  on mother jones  investigative journalist ari berman delves into an aspect of the  election that has been largely ignored in the shadow of controversies over internal dnc politics  shifting blame  and what is now known to be concrete russian interference  voter suppression on the heels of a report berman summarized back in september  his article for the november december issue of the liberal stalwart magazine continues where he left off  anecdotal evidence of individual voters who were prevented from voting in wisconsin during the presidential election all adds up to a picture that explains the numbers in the university of wisconsin madison study that berman cites in his summary the study  completed by uw madison s professor of political science  kenneth mayer  shows a survey in two large counties in wisconsin that asked whether respondents were either prevented or deterred from voting in  by the new voter id law in effect for the first time in that election  the results of the survey were stunning  more than  percent of respondents said they were deterred  and that  percent   more than half of the nonvoters   were prevented entirely  if those sound like small numbers  bear with me in the course of research  voters were asked why they didn t vote  how engaged they were in the election  what types of id they possessed  how confident they were in the final vote count  and their general demographics  the survey never required any respondent to answer who they may have voted for possibly the most distressing part of the findings was how disproportionately the voter id law affected low income and minority voters  more than  percent of households under    of income per year were deterred  that number dropped to just over  percent for those above that line  the demarcation between white and black voters was even more stark  with just of  percent of white voters reporting trouble and   percent of african americans reporting the same what does all that add up to as berman notes in the new piece for mj  wisconsin showed the second highest voter turnout in the united states in both  and   but just four years later  participation was the lowest it had been in  years so let s get back to those numbers in just the two counties that were surveyed  dane and milwaukee  the percentage of registered voters who were adversely affected by the new voter id law represents a low estimate of nearly   and an upper estimate of   voters  in fact  the study points out  the   percent nonvoter estimate is actually low in itself  as it doesn t take into account voters who were deterred from even registering by the new law if every single one of those in the study who answered that they were deterred or prevented from voting had actually cast a vote that counted  voter turnout would have increased by   percent  and that seems like an incredibly small number  until you extrapolate that across the state  the wisconsin election commission estimated that   million voters turned out for the  presidential election  that means   voters   under a conservative estimate   were disenfranchised entirely by the new voter id law donald trump s margin of victory in the state  less than a third of that given that the vast majority of disenfranchised voters  although they were not asked their political affiliations  were demographically more likely to vote for hillary clinton than for donald trump  it hardly requires extrapolation to conclude that  at least in the state of wisconsin  trump was right the vote was rigged featured image via scott olson getty images
