the investigation into possible collusion between donald trump s campaign and russia in an effort to fix the  election took a dark turn for the white house when it was revealed that now former fbi director james comey kept meticulous memos on significant conversations   particularly those he had with trump and top white house officials  it seems that comey was uneasy with trump  and wanted to document and preserve the nature of conversations that he felt took turns into the land of the inappropriate   or even possibly the illegal now  it seems that trump himself is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to these memos  white house chief of staff reince priebus is reportedly very worried about what could be in the rest of the memos  since all of the memos have been requested to be turned over to congress  it s only a matter of time before priebus   and the rest of the world   will know what is in those memos  and if priebus is this worried  chances are he s going to be in deep shit the main concern seems to be the fact that in february  when the russia situation had just begun to circulate and dominate the news cycle  priebus leaned on the fbi to do what it could to kill that story because it was harmful to the white house  now  this is highly inappropriate at best  and with the credibility of this white house being beyond shot thanks to all the lies they ve told  it s likely that the american people  as well as congress  will believe comey s memos  of course  at the time  then deputy fbi director andrew mccabe and then fbi director james comey rejected even the idea of doing priebus s bidding on this matter now that the memos have begun to drop  white house sources tell the daily beast that there is  quote   sustained panic  in the west wing over what could be in them  one staffer said  reince is worried about leaks  since elements in the fbi seem determined to wage this war in the press  initially the concern was about public perception trying to get russia out of the headlines but it s looking more like this will be a drawn out legal battle too  even if  eventually exonerated  the same person  speaking anonymously  went on to say that inside the west wing that there is a sort of a sense that if there s damning information out there it s going to come out one way or another someone leaks it to the times  or the president just blurts it out in an interview  the thing is  though  with this much smoke  there s likely fire somewhere  priebus and others likely know this  even if they weren t directly involved in any wrongdoing  just working in this white house at all could put someone in a position to follow orders that are at best improper and at worst criminal time to lawyer up  folks  and get out of this situation while you still can  trump is going down  and if you guys stay  you ll go down with him featured image via mark wilson getty images
