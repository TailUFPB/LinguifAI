in america  we have been having a conversation about police brutality against black americans  despite the countless black people murdered unjustly by police  there is usually no justice  sandra bland  philando castile  keith lamont scott  michael brown  freddie gray too many to mention here  really  all of those people were senselessly murdered by cops who chose to be their judges  juries  and executioners  and they did so with impunity and without consequence  however  there is hope  and it is coming out of south carolina  of all places north charleston police officer michael slager murdered walter scott  a black man who was fleeing after a routine traffic stop in cold blood in   he would have gotten away with it  too  had it not been for a citizen who was brave enough to tape the murder  the tape showed that slager had lied about his life being in danger  and it showed him cuffing scott s lifeless body  and then planting a taser as  evidence   here is the news report of that damning tape thanks to that tape  slager was arrested and charged with murder  now  fast forward two years later  and slager has been convicted of murder  u s  district judge david norton decided to throw the book at slager  and sentenced the murdering ex cop to   years in prison the original case ended in a mistrial  but the state of south carolina seemed determined to get justice for walter scott  and that happened on december      of course  slager s family begged for mercy from the judge  but luckily those calls were ignored  michael slager is a murderer  and he deserves the sentence he got so many times  these cases end with the murderous cops back on the force  out in the streets after what amounts to nothing more than a paid vacation  free to murder another black person at will again  thankfully  for once  the system worked as it should  for once  i am proud to be a south carolinian  hopefully this sets a precedent  and helps us turn a corner toward the arc of justice watch the video of the remarks of the scott family below  featured image via grace beahm pool getty images
