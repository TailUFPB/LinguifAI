during the campaign cycle  payments from the republican national committee to this company called the hamilton trading group drew some attention because the rnc said they were payments for an assessment of building security at rnc headquarters in washington and it looked unusual on a financial disclosure form  that was the rnc s story  as well as that of hamilton s co founder  ben wickham  and they stuck to it until recently  most of the    the rnc paid to hamilton actually went towards intelligence gathering for the purpose of digging up dirt on hillary clinton  wickham  an ex cia officer  insisted at the time that his work was entirely for building security  but now he s saying that he  wasn t totally forthcoming  because the dirt digging they did was protected under a non disclosure agreement the big kicker is that hamilton has strong connections in russia  they ve done background checks and provided security services for american companies and officials   work that was done by an ex kgb agent  according to wickham  gennady vasilenko has  very good contacts in russia   however  he also claims never to have had any contact with donald trump  paul manafort  or any of their people  and that their work has nothing to do with russia itself we re pretty sure at this point that russia hacked the dnc and began releasing batches of documents and emails that were damaging to the dnc for the purpose of helping trump and harming hillary  that the rnc worked with a company  which has its own ties to russia  to build two dossiers on hillary that supposedly showed she intervened on behalf of energy companies that had donated to the clinton foundation in both israel and bulgaria just compounds their growing  russia problem  trump has people on his team in the white house that have their own ties to russia  house intel chair devin nunes may have his own ties  now the rnc itself admits to paying a company with heavy connections to russia to dig up dirt on hillary clinton during the election  this has been out of control for a long time featured image by justin sullivan via getty images
