kellyanne conway just embarrassed herself again while also demonstrating just how cozy the trump administration is with white nationalists it may be valentine s day  but as a public employee who represents trump on a daily basis  conway should know better on tuesday  a white nationalist twitter account sent a valentine s day message to conway  your strength   resiliency in face of vile hatred  bigotry    sexism of the unhinged left is a daily inspiration  love you  well  if conway had done a little homework  she would have discovered that the twitter user is a white nationalist whose account proudly boasts that they  hate anti american liberals  marxists    commies  with hashtags that say   whiteidentity   nationalist  and  stevebannon  as we all know  steve bannon is sympathetic to white nationalists and he is a favorite of white nationalist groups  bannon is also donald trump s top adviser who is likely pulling the strings in the white house anyway  conway told the white racist   love you back  after being called out on twitter  conway removed the tweet and claimed that someone else tweeted from her account seriously  i don t know who had access to my account   conway claimed   let me see who tweeted that  that s terrible  i denounce whoever it is  it will be immediately deleted  everybody makes mistakes  let s just get this straight  kellyanne conway works for the so called  president   she is one of his top advisers and probably has security clearances  yet she claims someone she doesn t know managed to gain access to her twitter account  that s a really pathetic excuse the day after michael flynn resigned as national security adviser for being a security risk it s more likely that conway retweeted the white nationalist and decided to lie about doing so  but either way  kellyanne conway looks incompetent clearly  michael flynn is not the only trump adviser who should have resigned featured image via screen capture
