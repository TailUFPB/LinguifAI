whether or not trump obstructed justice in his interactions with james comey has been the subject of hot debate ever since comey was fired from his position as fbi director on may   now  senior intelligence officials familiar with special counsel mueller s investigation have confirmed that he s looking into whether or not trump actually did obstruct justice to conservatives who believe that obstruction of justice requires specific intent and a specific act  the whole idea that trump obstructed justice simply by doing what he s done is preposterous  nevertheless  obstruction of justice occurs when someone aware of a proceeding tries to interfere with it bstructions of justice aimed at judicial officers  grand and petit jurors  and witnesses  the law makes it a crime to threaten  intimidate  or retaliate against these participants in a criminal or civil proceeding  in addition   illegal to attempt the bribery of an official to alter the outcome of a judicial proceeding besides these specific prohibitions  the law contains the omnibus clause  which states that a person who  corruptly or by threats of force  or by threatening letter or communication  influences  obstructs  or impedes  or endeavors to influence  obstruct  or impede  the due administration of justice  is guilty of the crime of obstruction of justice  this clause offers broad protection to the  due administration of justice   federal courts have read this clause expansively to proscribe any conduct that interferes with the judicial process  the way that trump communicated with comey about the investigation into michael flynn and russia  and then again in the way he so abruptly fired comey and virtually admitted that he did so because of the russia probe  could fall under this definition  all that s really needed is for the investigation to prove  that there was a pending federal judicial proceeding  the defendant knew of the proceeding  and the defendant had corrupt intent to interfere with or attempted to interfere with the proceeding  prior to comey s firing  the fbi had convened a grand jury in the flynn investigation  which issued subpoenas for michael flynn s business records around the same time that comey was fired  as cnn put it  the grand jury represented the first major escalation in the broader russian probe mueller s office plans to interview various intelligence officials soon  which suggests that mueller s views on the matter are more in line with the idea that he was actively trying to impede comey s work  rather than just a disagreement between comey and trump about what was said a spokesman for trump s lawyer  of course  expressed outrage that this has made the news the fbi leak of information regarding the president is outrageous  inexcusable and illegal  as we know  trump and his supporters repeatedly claim that the real story is how all these leaks are happening and why nobody does anything about them  while leaks are a problem  they are not the main story  the trump administration uses them as a deflection it s not clear whether mueller will actually pursue the charge of obstruction of justice  however  if he does  it will ultimately be congress  decision as to what to do with it   not the doj s  and congressional republicans seem to be adamant that they won t impeach  however  if mueller is able to lay out a convincing enough case  then congress may find itself without any choice but to impeach featured image via alex wong getty images
