it turns out that there are a few new reasons for wisconsin to proceed with their recount  and they have nothing to do with jill stein s recount petition  yes  she filed the petition and yes  she paid the fee  but the state needed to do this even without stein s request  a new analysis in the washington post discovered significant voting anomalies in several wards trump now leads hillary by just over   votes in wisconsin  the wapo analysis didn t look at precincts or counties   they looked at wards  which are the smallest unit where votes are counted  this helped create a more detailed picture of what s happening there walter mebane  an associate researcher at the center for political studies and a professor of political science and statistics at the university of michigan  looked at small wards that used optical scanning technology  and found that certain features in the vote tabulations reveal the possibility that these counts were tampered with for instance  using a method called  last digit diagnostics   mebane found that the tabulations he looked at should have last digits that  when averaged together  show a mean of around    lower could mean that the counts were manipulated in the small wards he looked at where optical scanning tech was used  the last digit diagnostics reveal a mean average much lower than   another statistic mebane looked at was how often the last digit of a vote tabulation was zero  or five  if there are no problems  then the mean average of that variable should be around    larger could mean someone was sloppy  and smaller could mean votes were manipulated in these small wards  that number was significantly smaller than   for hillary  meaning that the vote counts show a last digit of zero or five far less often than they should he also found evidence of something called  signaling  in the tabulations  which is when fraudsters leave a type of trail that more or less claims credit for the fraud  mebane points out that this is actually a fairly common tactic amongst fraudsters in russia finally  a simple test revealed something called  multimodality   which could show that someone was receiving fraudulent votes  these small wards exhibited that anomaly  too none of this is absolute proof of election fraud or vote fraud in wisconsin  and mebane is careful to note that  however  it gives credence to the need for a recount  whatever jill stein s motivations are  if nothing else  conducting a thorough recount will lend further legitimacy to our democratic process or concretely reveal problems that need to be fixed  it might also serve to weaken trump s efforts to undermine our democracy by repeatedly crying  fraud   fraud everywhere   the recount begins today featured image by darren hauck via getty images
