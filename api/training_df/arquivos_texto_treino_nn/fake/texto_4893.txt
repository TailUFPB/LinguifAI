you know how we often jest  largely because it s true  that conservatives are racist  well  maybe we ve misjudged them  the republican mayor of midland city  alabama had a classy response when someone asked her how the election went  breaking what seems to be an unending series of trump supporters and other racists republicans saying horrible things about black people  patsy capshaw skipper congratulated her opponent  jo ann bennett grimsley  on a hard fought race and wished her well  just kidding   she called her a n gger  because skipper is a republican and what do you really expect from them these days skipper  with  votes  was soundly defeated by grimsley s   with a third candidate managing    i hope she does a great job for the city and i am very happy for her   the current mayor said publicly when asked how she feels about grimsley being her new mayor  but outside the spotlight  seemingly protected by her facebook privacy settings  she had a slightly different opinion a man named don thompson  apparently posting on his wife s account  asked how the election is going  leading skipper to go from zero to racist in less than a second the only response this received was  i m so sorry  it s appalling   arlissa minniefield  who serves as town clerk and magistrate for the town of newton  said thursday  it was she who shared the post   as a former employee there  to know that you worked under people that had those kinds of feelings is very disheartening   she has previously served as magistrate for midland city but never fear   skipper claimed that her facebook has been  messed up for several weeks  and adds  i think i ve been hacked  facebook  of course  offers robust  and  at time  irritating  security features that force a person to enter a code that is sent to a user s cell phone if they attempt to log in from an unfamiliar device  before this feature was implemented  the  hacked  excuse was viable  but not today  skippy  not today she says that she had just undergone heart surgery and had not even been out to campaign for re election  interestingly  she was able to remove the post from her  hacked  account   unless  of course  our mystery hacker felt bad about what he or she did and un did the damage  you know  since hackers are typically known as being magnanimous this is one epic f ckup that can not be blamed on voters  when her husband  virgil  retired in february due to health reasons  midland city council voted   to appoint skipper to fill his shoes  it is unclear if she also fills his klan robe and hood  or if she picked those up herself featured image via screengrab
