as of this writing  it is not even   am on the east coast and donald trump is already awake and tweeting  what s got him so agitated at such an early hour this time  why  his muslim ban of course  which he disgracefully promoted after the london terror attacks  or rather  as he is now calling it  a  travel ban  inexplicably  trump is upset with regards to how this ill fated executive order has been referred to in the papers and the courts  and he just had to assert that it is he who will decide what to call it  and no one else  trump tweeted people  the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want  but i am calling it what we need and what it is  a travel ban   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     he went on to rant that the department of justice was wrong to defy his original muslim ban but instead went for the  watered down  politically correct version    also commonly known as muslim ban   the justice dept  should have stayed with the original travel ban  not the watered down  politically correct version they submitted to s c   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    course  we all remember that the first muslim ban explicitly placed a religious test on people coming from the countries on trump s list of banned nations   which  of course  is unconstitutional  further  it simply takes trump back to his campaign promise of a muslim ban  those of us who have spent so much as two seconds listening to this buffoon already knew this was what it was anyway then  of course  trump continued to tweet  this time attacking the courts as he always does over rulings that he doesn t like the justice dept  should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the supreme court     seek much tougher version   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the u s  in order to help keep our country safe  the courts are slow and political   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     the court system can be slow  you big baby  but that s because they d rather get their rulings right than push them through to satisfy impatient morons like you  further  if you had any sense  you d know that these tweets are now a matter of public record  and they will be used against you in a court of law this unconstitutional and bigoted ban will be struck down in the supreme court  just as it has been in all of the lower courts  you might not have had checks and balances atop your golden tower  but you certainly do while you sit in the oval office welcome to governing  you big orange idiot  you can t just do what you want anymore  should have thought of that before you took the job  as for the rest of us  we ll just keep watching you make a fool of yourself on twitter featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
