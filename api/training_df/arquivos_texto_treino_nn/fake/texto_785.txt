when republicans talk about cutting taxes  they generally talk about cutting the taxes of the wealthy and the major corporations under the absolute lie that those tax cuts will lead to prosperity for everyone else  but that s not working  and they know it  they just can t admit it  to make up for the shortfalls caused by these tax cuts  they now want to effectively raise taxes on certain other people  their opponents  the democrats their current tax reform plan calls for eliminating the federal deduction for state and local taxes  but wait  you might ask  how is that only raising taxes on democrats  doesn t that raise taxes on everyone  well  yes  but this would disproportionately affect blue states   specifically  connecticut  new york  new jersey  and california these are the states where taxpayers get the biggest deductions  therefore  these people would see their taxes go up considerably more than people living in red states  these four states have high taxes  but they also have high property values and high cost of living  no red state ranks in the top  for this particular deduction  one might say that the low taxes in red states are better anyway  but then why is it that blue states tend to be more wealthy and prosperous it s a well known fact that blue states generally subsidize red states at the federal level  they send more dollars to the federal government than they receive  red states  on the other hand  take in a lot more and pay a lot less to the federal government  essentially  red states live off the backs of blue states while whining up one side and down the other about socialism and having to pay to subsidize other people the national average for this particular deduction is just over     but the four states listed above all deduct more than     what better way to ensure that the residents of these states pay even more for the poverty in red states than to eliminate thousands of dollars of deductions republican lawmakers from these blue states are pushing back very hard on this  because it is  in effect  selective tax increase on people who actually do need to see their taxes cut  however  other republicans are claiming that eliminating this deduction will actually allow congress to lower other taxes oh  please  it won t work that way  not because it can t  this would raise enough money to pay for lower income taxes  if done right   but because republicans are incapable of coming up with a plan that s actually beneficial to low  and middle income americans here s a novel idea  why don t they eliminate certain tax breaks and loopholes that only apply to the top  percent  instead of one that the shrinking middle class benefits from too  oh wait  they can t do that  they ll lose their rich backers if they do featured image via alex wong getty images
