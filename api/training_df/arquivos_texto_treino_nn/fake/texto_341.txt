the gop has a thing for porn  in   sen  todd weiler introduced legislation asking his state to recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard and republicans thought that was a cool idea  well  now it s  and a florida lawmaker who filed a similar proposal was just busted favoriting a porn tweet  you could say he got ted cruzed just a few days ago  state rep  ross spano filed a bill to declare pornography a public health crisis in florida  but from his twitter account  it appears he  liked  a pornographic tweet according to the orlando weekly  the republican s list of likes on twitter is typically football clips  bible verses  and gop related content about how evil islam is  but  nestled into his  likes  list is a tweet from jan   by the  goddess lesbian  twitter account  which features a video clip from adult entertainment company reality kings  on that same day  spano liked a biblical quote tweet from franklin graham but we re not sure if that was before or after he was watching lesbians having sexy time in front of the camera screenshot this wouldn t matter in the least except for the bill spano filled    which the orlando weekly notes is  incredibly harsh on adult content  and he left that  liked  porn tweet up for nine months  it appears to be deleted now  franklin graham s liked tweet is still there  though the bill  which is contrary to research  states that  recent research indicates that pornography is potentially biologically addictive  resulting in the user consuming increasingly more shocking material to satisfy the addiction   and adds   pornography has a detrimental effect on families and is linked to a reluctance to enter into marriage  dissatisfaction in marriage and marital infidelity  spano says he didn t do it  it wasn t him being horny on twitter obviously  i have a long social media history on facebook  twitter  and instagram since i was first elected in   with a thorough examination of my accounts  it will be easy to see that this is not my doing  i have since gone back  once notified  and rectified the problem  and i m now looking into how it occurred in the first place in addition  referencing my prior statement  i don t believe any of this takes the focus off of the fact that there is a direct correlation between pornography and a host of societal problems  including human trafficking  exploitation of children  sex slavery  and domestic violence sure  it wasn t spano  it must have been that other spano guy with the same twitter account and password  sounds legit image via youtube screen capture
