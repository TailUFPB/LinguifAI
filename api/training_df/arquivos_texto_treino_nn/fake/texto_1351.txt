if you are a low income earner and over  years of age  just be warned  you will be paying more than half of your annual income on health insurance in the individual market under the republican party s new health care bill set to replace obamacare  the american health care act the congressional budget office found that the revised bill does  in fact  bring down overall premiums in the individual market at a rate of between four to twenty percent by  when compared to the current law  the variation in percentage differs state by state  depending on whether the state accepts regulatory waivers under the american health care act  which would allow insurers to offer much skimpier health plans at lower premiums  what this means is that states that allow the waivers would have far lower premiums  but the individual would be covered for a lot less  as well  whereas states that don t have the waivers would have a higher rate  but more comprehensive coverage premiums would also differ greatly depending on age and income and it looks pretty grim for individuals in an older age bracket who are on a fixed income using an annual income of    as an example  an individual aged  years old may have an advantage with the new scheme  currently  under the affordable care act  that individual pays an average of    per year on insurance premiums  this amount would drop to just    under the american health care act if their state accepts regulatory waivers  although they would be covered for less  in a state that doesn t accept waivers  the average premiums for a  year old would actually increase by around   per annum to about    per year however  a  year old on an annual income of    is currently still spending that average amount of    per annum on premiums under obamacare  but things look pretty bleak under the american health care act  under the new republican bill  roughly  percent of their income will go toward insurance premiums if they live in a state that doesn t accept waivers  forking out around    a year  it s still not a whole lot better in other states  where they would be paying     still more than half of their wages if  however  that  year old is making at least    per year  they look to be better off in certain situations under the republican party s new scheme  one whose tax credit is based on age  not income  an annual income of    is too high to receive a tax credit under obamacare so the individual would be expected to pay    in insurance premiums  whereas under trump s american health care act  their premium would drop to    in a state that accepts regulatory waivers  but would actually increase to    in a state that doesn t the reason for this is not just the age factor  but also because the tax credit under the american health care act starts phasing out at     individuals on a yearly income of    or more will receive fewer  if any  subsidies under the new republican bill and can expect to pay more in premiums than they would under the affordable care act this is all achieved in a variety of ways  first  obamacare s income based tax credits  which gave more to low income earners  will be abolished and replaced with a tax credit based on age for those with an annual salary below     one that gives older people slightly more  also  the american health care act adjusts a rule that obamacare had in place to protect older people from higher premiums  this rule takes into consideration that the elderly are generally in worse health than the young so insurers are only allowed to charge an older person about three times what they would charge a younger person  under the new republican bill  insurers would be able to charge an older person five times what they would charge a younger person   percent more than they could under obamacare as a result  the republican bill will  in theory  bring insurance premiums down in general  but at the expense of older and poorer americans  nobody knew health care would be so complicated featured image via bill clark pool getty images
