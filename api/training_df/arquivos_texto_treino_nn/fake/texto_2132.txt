soon  if you live in florida  it will become very difficult to prosecute for murder florida s loose murder laws became national headlines with the death of trayvon martin  in which a  year old african american boy was caught in the act of walking at night  george zimmerman  who was nothing more than a self appointed neighborhood watch officer  killed zimmerman in   after more than a year of right wing media thoroughly trashing the victim  zimmerman was found not guilty of murder  a zimmerman of today would find it even easier  assuming the bill passes if the measure becomes law  the state would again be at the forefront of expanding self defense laws  florida would become the first state to apply a tougher standard to the law during the pretrial hearing  under the measure  the burden of proof would be shifted to prosecutors and defendants would no longer have to present evidence  typically by taking the stand  to prove their claim of self defense instead  prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt   the highest legal standard   that the use of force was not justified  prosecutors have fiercely opposed the measure  saying it runs counter to the traditional workings of the criminal justice system  typically  when defendants seek the dismissal of charges at a hearing   arguing entrapment  for example   it is up to them to present evidence and persuade the court  not the other way around the new standard would require prosecutors to essentially put on a nonjury mini trial  requiring victims and witnesses to testify twice and delaying the actual trial  prosecutors said  and with defendants no longer required to offer evidence   which usually means taking the stand   there will be little  if any downside  for them to claim a stand your ground defense source  new york timescurrent stand your ground laws make already make it easy to get away with murder  if you re white  in states with stand your ground laws  there has been an eight percent increase in murder and in non negligent manslaughter  in other words  more people are dying and more people are getting away with it getting away with murder isn t for everyone  though  according to studies   whites who kill blacks in stand your ground states are far more likely to be found justified in their killings  in non stand your ground states  whites are  percent more likely to be found justified in killing a black person than a white person who kills another white person  in stand your ground states  that number jumps to  percent  this proposed florida law would only make things worse  when the burden of proof lies entirely with the dead guy in murder cases  it s difficult enough to prove  but when you add to the fact that the victim is black  well  you know how things will turn out  as they say  dead men tell no tales  to far too many  though  a dead black man has the presumption of guilt featured image via pool getty images
