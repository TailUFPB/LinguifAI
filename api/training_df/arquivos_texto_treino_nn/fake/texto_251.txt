proving that donald trump and his administration is the most clueless  out of touch team to  lead  america  vice president mike pence just had a really awkward run in with one of the survivors of hurricane maria as puerto rico is absolutely ravaged from the recent hurricane  trump has decided to turn his back on u s  citizens and instead focus on attacking nfl players and the media  meanwhile  his team is trying to do damage control to pick up the slack  and sent pence to puerto rico to assure survivors that everything would be okay  unfortunately  that plan backfired tremendously everlinda burgos  a survivor of hurricane maria from central puerto rico  ruined pence s photo op by holding the trump administration accountable and pointing out that they weren t doing nearly enough  as cameras rolled  burgos put pence on the spot and said  don t go to san juan  go inside the country  like where i live  i live in naranjito  that s inside the country  right now  inside the country is where you re going to see the disaster  where you can t   there s towns you can t go in  burgos also nailed pence s boss by bringing up trump s disgusting  insensitive comment that puerto rico officials should be  very proud  that only sixteen people had died  burgos said  you don t know the people that has died there because they don t know  they don t have no communication  you know  so  right now they say  people died  no  no  no  we have more people died  but we don t have no communication  so  go in  and things got even worse for pence  off camera  a woman jumped in to correct burgos and said the most current death toll stated thirty four  burgos added  thirty four today  right now  that s what they say outside  pence didn t know what the hell to say  so he muttered  good to talk   but burgos wasn t done with him  she said  i would like you to go to the center  because that s where the disaster is  pence made a half ass agreement and then asked   you ll be fine  your son  your family  and then you ll be able to go home  right   clearly  he was still clueless of how bad the situation was  and likely had no intention of going through with his promise you can watch his awkward exchange with burgos below the people of puerto rico deserve better featured image via mark wilson   getty images
