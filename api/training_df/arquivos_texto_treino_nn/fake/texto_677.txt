one would think that the gun industry would thrive under an entirely republican government  because more people would feel good about the government s stance on gun legislation  the nra loves republicans because they always push to loosen gun laws  even in the face of horrific tragedy  especially in the face of horrific tragedy   oddly enough  such is not the case  the gun industry is suffering under donald trump  and the reason why is quite amusing  to say the least the gun industry  which the nra represents whether they want to admit it or not  thrives on fear   specifically  fear of losing gun rights  conservatives  abject fear that the government will make buying guns more difficult  and will probably also come and take the guns they already have  really only happens under democrats  so they go out and buy up more guns so that a  they already have their guns  and b  so they re better able to defend themselves when the big  bad  tyrannical blue people come to steal what they think is their only method of holding onto their freedoms under president obama  various gun manufacturers  share prices soared because of the increased sales  the market responded badly to trump s election  however  and these same manufacturers  shares plummeted and have not recovered  the post election market boom that other industries enjoyed didn t touch the gun industry  you can see the huge dip two major manufacturers took in november  just after the election  and how much they ve struggled to recover below image via yahoo  financeof course  gun manufacturers are trying to spin the republicans  victories as a positive on their earnings calls  in february  michael fifer  the ceo of sturm  ruger  said  you ve got more concealed carry in more states  you ve got more new shooters coming along  all that stuff drives demand  and in some municipalities  you have the cops backing off  they re being seen by the media too often as the enemy  and so  they re backing off  and crime rates in those cities are soaring to the roof  those people could care less who s president  they want to defend themselves  but as of today  share prices continued their slumps  for an industry that thrives on fear of democrats  a republican government is a dreadful thing featured image via spencer platt getty images
