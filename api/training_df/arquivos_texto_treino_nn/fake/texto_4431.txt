during the first presidential debate  donald trump threatened to attack hillary clinton with her husband s extramarital affairs  he has spent every day since bragging about how much credit he deserves for not pulling out bill s infidelities as a weapon against his opponent in an interview on thursday  trump said he  would have had the right  to take aim at the former president and his scandals for two reasons  first of all  said the gop nominee  hillary is a big meanie who has said  horrible and false things  about him  second  bill is fair game because he has been campaigning on his wife s behalf trump also tried to claim that the reason he chose to take such a high road is because chelsea clinton was sitting in the front row at the debate and he is such a classy  upstanding guy that he just couldn t bring himself to say those awful things in front of such a sweet young lady when the reporter asked him why bill s scandals reflected poorly on hillary  since she wasn t the one who had actually done anything wrong  trump s response was as disgusting as every other vile  misogynistic thing that comes out of his mouth  well  you ll have to figure that out  i think it s pretty simple to figure that out   trump replied featured image via spencer platt getty images
