a category four hurricane has hit texas  it s set to be the most disastrous hurricane since katrina hit louisiana in   yet donald trump is using it as an opportunity to deport people thousands of people are evacuating the affected areas  trying to beat the storm  instead of helping ensure that evacuations go smoothly  the trump administration is doing the exact opposite  they are creating checkpoints and forcing people to show their  papers  proving they are documented residents of the united states the federal government is closing border patrol checkpoints in the path of the hurricane  but they re leaving checkpoints open outside the path  the texas tribune reports  border patrol checkpoints will not be closed unless there is a danger to the safety of the traveling public and our agents  border patrol resources  including personnel and transportation  will be deployed on an as needed basis to augment the efforts and capabilities of local response authorities   the agency said in a statement the border patrol is a law enforcement agency and we will not abandon our law enforcement duties  i m sure you can imagine the consequences  sure  checkpoints will only be open outside the path of the hurricane  but they can still cause traffic to back up for miles  it will also all but ensure that undocumented immigrants and their families will stay behind  only to be potentially killed by the hurricane or the resulting floods civil rights agencies like the aclu are furious  this is a disgusting move from the border patrol that breaks with past practices   american civil liberties union director of immigration policy and campaigns lorella praeli said   the border patrol should never keep checkpoints open during any natural disasters in the united states  everyone  no matter the color of their skin or background  is worth saving  everyone  no matter the color of their skin or background  is worth saving   except to donald trump  they really aren t  trump doesn t care about anyone  but he does care about appeasing his racist  xenophobic base  john edwards used to talk about two americas  today  we have the america that donald trump cares about  about   of the country  and we have the rest of us who could all die in the path of a hurricane for all he cares featured image via pool getty images
