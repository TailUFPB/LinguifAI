melania trump has proved over the past year that she is just as dishonest as her husband  now it appears that she committed perjury by lying under oath about her nonexistent college degree shortly after she was busted plagiarizing her speech at the republican national convention  stealing an entire paragraph from michelle obama  it came to light that she was also full of sh t when she claimed that she had graduated from the university of ljubljana in slovenia with a degree in architecture  in truth  melania dropped out after her freshman year when she moved to the united states to pursue her modeling career  possibly under a visa that was less than legal  when the blatant lie surfaced  her website promptly pulled her bio but now  it looks like she didn t just lie to the general public about having a degree  she also lied in court while testifying under oath  which happens to make her guilty of committing perjury according to a report by racked com  the case involved her caviar skincare line  which never made it off the ground  the line was promoted on good morning america  her husband s show the apprentice and on cnbc  but when all was said and done  the skin care products never became a reality  the contract for the line was trashed when steve hilbert  who was a personal friend  was fired from the cosmetic company she was working with  new sunshine llc the situation eventually resulted in a lawsuit and melania was asked to testify in court  she told the judge how angry and frustrated she was that she had worked so hard to promote the product line that the company ultimately never launched  and here s where it gets interesting the attorney asked melania various questions about her personal background and according to the transcripts  she was less than truthful  where were you born  mrs  trump   the attorney asked  i was born in slovenia   she answered  would you please explain to the judge your formal education including what schools you attended and from which you graduated   the attorney requested  i attended and graduated from design school  from fashion and industrial design school and also attended  graduated from architecture degree  bachelor degree   she testified under oath court transcripts of melania trump s testimony via racked com screen shot as already established  this is a boldfaced lie because she dropped out after attending classes for only one year perjury is a criminal offense that is not to be taken lightly  being convicted of perjury in a federal case can land you behind bars for up to five years and get you slapped with hefty fines  perjury in state cases is punishable by a minimum of a year in jail  republicans certainly can t stop screaming  perjury  when it comes to hillary clinton  but surely this fickle bunch will have no trouble ignoring it altogether in melania s case featured image via alex wong getty images
