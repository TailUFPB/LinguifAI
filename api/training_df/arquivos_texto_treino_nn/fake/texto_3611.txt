typically  children view santa as a magical bearded guy who brings them presents  sometimes he s white  sometimes he s black  sometimes he s other races altogether   because he is a fictional character and he can be whatever is most appropriate to an individual  unfortunately  this is not a concept that conservatives can accept  having grown accustomed to their familiar  chalky faced representation of santa claus after wcco reported that a black santa would be coming to mall of america in minneapolis  minnesota  for the first time in history  trump fans and other racist swarmed to show their displeasure with the fact that this santa wasn t white as chalk  it s no big deal  i m still santa  i just happen to be a santa of color   santa larry jefferson told the news station  noting that he was the only santa of color at a convention over the summer  jefferson says that a child recently commented on his skin color  but in the end santa is santa to kids regardless of hue  it gives them something to identity with  but santa is still just santa  just saturday  i was doing an event  and one child said   santa  you re brown   and i said   yes  i am  but santa comes in many different colors   he said   oh   so i gave him a candy cane  he ran off with other kids  it s a pretty simple concept  santa   a character based on a black man   can be purple with pink polka dots and a chrome finish on his wicked awesome spiked shoulder pads if one wishes  as long as he dumps presents in billions of childrens  living rooms by six am on christmas morning  he s a magical creature who drives a sleigh pulled by flying reindeer   but some feel that appearing as a skin color beyond white is beyond the scope of his wicked awesome powers   namely  trump voters who swarmed the comment section  fukin disgusting   one man wrote in traditional republican allcaps   nigers are destroying the nation   his solution to black santas destroying the nation is to  exterminate the niger race  to save  humans  from  mongrel apes   another called for a  boycott  of mall of america because  santa is white   others called it  offensive  to portray santa   who  once again  is a character based on a black man from turkey   as black  another wondered why  these people shaped apes  can t just  stick to their made up kwanza ritual                unfortunately  this is the sort of shit we will be dealing with more and more as time goes on watch a report on jefferson s hiring below featured image via screengrab
