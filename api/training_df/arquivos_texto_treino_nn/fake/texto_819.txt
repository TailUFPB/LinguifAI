it s no secret that republicans seem to think that the movie idiocracy is a documentary  they refuse to believe the scientific consensus that climate change is manmade and a big f cking deal  republicans actually think that higher education is bad and well  the rise in  flat earthers   can t be a coincidence is it any surprise  then  that the republican led house committee on science  space and technology doesn t have a single scientist  that s not even the worst of it  they have as a ranking member rep  dana rohrabacher  r california   whose greatest hits include blaming prehistorical climate change on dinosaur farts during a panel with real scientists  as opposed to those who play scientist in congress  rohrabacher even topped the dinosaur theory  in a discussion about mars  in which a nasa scientist said there might have been life on mars many  many years ago  rohrabacher just had to ask  you have indicated that mars   was totally different thousands of years ago  is it possible that there was a civilization on mars thousands of years ago  source  slateyeah  just a couple of things here  the nasa scientist was talking about microbial life  not anything resembling human life and we re talking billions of years  not thousands of years ago  then again  it seems that most christian republicans think the earth is just   years old  so it s doubtful rohrabacher can think in such vast terms kenneth farley  who worked on the  rover and europa clipper  and is a professor of geochemistry at the california institute of technology  somehow didn t lose his patience with rohrabacher  and simply said  so  the evidence is that mars was different billions of years ago   not thousands of years ago   farley said   there is no evidence that i am aware of  rohrabacher  presumably refusing to take  no  for an answer  asked   would you rule that out  harley said   that is extremely unlikely  here s the video featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
