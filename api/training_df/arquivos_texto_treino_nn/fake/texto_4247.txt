donald trump thinks he should be president despite bragging about sexually assaulting women by grabbing them  by the p ssy   but he once fired a woman for saying something far less inflammatory in his boardroom during the final moments of an episode of celebrity apprentice in   trump listened as professional wrestler  maria kanellis  blasted chef curtis stone for using her dressing room to take a  crap  the reason why i said you were so arrogant was because you came in our dressing room and you took a crap and left the stench in the room   kanellis said while seated in the boardroom facing trump as his son  donald jr   looked on even though his behavior was completely inappropriate  stone and trump focused on kanellis using the word  crap   calling it  a little below the belt   trump also called her use of the word  disgusting  and  gross  before firing her for using locker room talk  this is my boardroom  it s not a locker room  maria  you re fired  here s the video via twitter donald trump in    this is my boardroom  it s not a locker room  maria  you re fired           pic twitter com   the daily show   thedailyshow  october    you can see  this is prime example of trump s hypocrisy  ever since audio of his outrageous remarks about groping women came to light on friday  trump and his team have been writing the remarks off as mere  locker room talk  that should have no bearing on the election but unlike the celebrities in the boardroom  donald trump is trying to gain the highest office in the united states  so his remarks  especially his use of the word  p ssy   should absolutely be held against him  they reveal his lack of character and how he treats women  whereas saying the word  crap  is pretty damn harmless in comparison donald trump literally fired kanellis for saying  crap  in his own boardroom  but he thinks he should be hired by the american people as the new president  despite using a worse word to describe how he sexually assaults women  trump is nothing more than a misogynist who holds women to a standard that he can t follow himself  firing a woman for saying a word instead of firing the man who took a shit in her dressing room  uninvited  proves that trump will not be able to treat women fairly in the white house  and that he would let male employees get away with bad behavior towards them this is not the kind of person we need leading our country featured image  ethan miller getty images
