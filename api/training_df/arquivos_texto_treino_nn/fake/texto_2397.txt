liberals love us some ruth bader ginsberg  who has been carrying the supreme court s torch for sanity for about  years  she s also  years old  which in this climate of republican domination and with an administration that doesn t give a damn about the constraints of the constitution  is a little bit worrisome  in an appearance at george washington university in washington  d c   ginsburg told the audience that she s got this  she s not going anywhere if she can help it  i will do this job as long as i can do it full steam   ginsburg    said at an appearance thursday night at george washington university in washington  d c   when i can t  that will be the time i will step down  in an interview on the bbc s  newsnight  broadcast  ginsburg noted that justice john paul stevens was  when he retired and said   so i have a way to go  ginsburg held her tongue on donald trump after she was forced to apologize for remarks building up to the election  but she did say   we are not experiencing the best times   and noted that our political system is like a pendulum and it always swings back  she did allude to trump s campaign slogan  though  when she said that  we are not as mindful of what makes america great  source  nbchere s the video ginsburg is the oldest justice on the court by over three years  presumably  donald trump will fill the court s current vacancy  which occurred when  ber conservative justice antonin scalia died in february of last year  republicans refused to let president obama fill the seat  but now that they control both houses of congress and the presidency  it s likely that trump s nominee  neil gorsuch  will get through  even with ginsburg on the court  that would leave us with a  justice minority on a nine justice court liberals  for good reason  are feeling very protective toward the diminutive legal powerhouse  i m very interested in this   says jeanette bavwidinski  a community organizer in pennsylvania   i m interested in what her daily regimen is  like  what are you all feeding rbg  is she getting enough fresh air  is she walking  is she staying low stress  what is she reading  is she reading low stress things  can she eat more kale   asks kim landsbergen  a forest ecologist in ohio   eat more kale  that s all i can say  we love you  eat more kale  source  washington postthe good news for us is that ginsburg is taking her health quite seriously  possibly because she s already survived cancer twice  and she was back at work two weeks after surgery  ginsburg works out  every morning  she does a routine of planks and push ups  that s not all  she has performed the canadian air force workout and doesn t shy away from sports like waterskiing and horseback riding  intellectually  she s still sharp as a tack we ll certainly need ginsburg to stick around for at least four more years and at the rate she s going  she probably will featured image via allison shelly getty images
