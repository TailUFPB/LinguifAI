republicans seriously need to pay attention in biology class because if they had  they would know that the reason women get pregnant in the first place is because of men and that s why women need prenatal care to be covered by health insurance plans but republicans like rep  john shimkus think that men should not have to pay for prenatal care in their insurance plans  even though by doing exactly that they are protecting pregnant women and the fetuses they carry during a committee hearing on thursday  shimkus openly whined about men having to pay for prenatal care and argued that insurance companies should only make women pay for it economist austin goolsbee expressed confusion over shimkus  objection and proceeded to explain to him how insurance works  if you look at any insurance product  everyone pays in because there s a risk that a small number of people are going to have a claim   goolsbee began   so  there s a subsidy  if you want to call it that  from people who don t get in car accidents to people who do get in car accidents  that s the nature of insurance  everyone is born  i think we can agree on that  the prenatal care is good for society  that we are covering prenatal care  that women can have babies in a healthy way  and to object that men shouldn t have to pay for things that are women s problems  young people shouldn t pay in for things that are old people s problems  hopefully all the young people will be old people  eventually  as i say  that s how insurance markets work  i don t understand this objection  indeed  that s how social security works  each generation of workers basically subsidizes the retirement of workers who came before them  this way  senior citizens can retire and live comfortably while a younger person gets a job republicans can also look at prenatal care another way  if they are seriously going to force women to carry pregnancies to term  the least they can do is help make sure that the mother and fetus are healthy and getting the medical attention they need the cost of prenatal care insurance would skyrocket if women were the only ones having to pay for it since the insurance pool would be smaller msnbc host stephanie ruhle  who has three children  also chimed in by informing republicans that women don t impregnate themselves  congressman shimkus  if you are watching  unlike tom price  i m not a doctor  but i will talk science for a moment  though it is women who need that prenatal care  men are involved in the process that requires them to need prenatal care  fyi  here s the video via youtube republicans should be ashamed of themselves for complaining so much about women s healthcare  their mothers  sisters  daughters  and wives must be embarrassed featured image via screenshot
