a first of its kind lawsuit was announced on monday  the lawsuit will be filed jointly by maryland s attorney general  brian frosh and the district of columbia s attorney general  karl racine  the lawsuit claims that trump is in violation of the emolument clause in the constitution  the emolument clause prevents the potus from receiving gifts from foreign governments  it s essentially a charge of corruption  because of trump s refusal to disown his company  the attorney general s believe that they have the grounds to file an injunction against trump for violating the constitution  the president is bound by oath to  faithfully execute  his office and  preserve  protect and defend the constitution of the united states   the lawsuit says  the lawsuit also alleges that trump is  deeply enmeshed with a legion of foreign and domestic government actors  in order for the lawsuit to be successful  the accuser must prove that trump s business has done harm to maryland and d c  a hurdle that the attorney s lawyer will be easy to accomplish those who are anxious to take a look at trump s personal tax returns should follow this case as it develops  racine and frosh have stated that the first step in their legal challenge will be to examine trump s tax returns in order to understand the full extent of his financial holdings  however  the court may impose privacy protections that prevent trump s tax documents from being released to the public  at least legally  never in the history of this country have we had a president with these kinds of extensive business entanglements or a president who refused to adequately distance themselves from their holdings   racine during said during a press conference in washington d c  racine also said that  we re getting in here to be the check and balance that it appears congress is unwilling to be  we re bringing  suit because the president has not taken adequate steps to separate himself from his business interests  it is unprecedented that the american people must question day after day whether decisions are made and actions are taken to benefit the united states or to benefit donald trump   frosh said during the press conference white house press secretary sean spicer dismissed the lawsuit as nothing more than a political attack aimed at trump  it s not hard to conclude that partisan politics may be one of the motivations   behind the legal case  spicer said in response to the lawsuit   the suit was filed by two democratic attorney generals  the lawyers driving the suit are an advocacy group with partisan ties  it actually started with a press conference as opposed to filing it  which is interesting  it should be pointed out that the fact that the suit was announced at a press conference isn t actually very interesting at all  spicer was blatantly trying to delegitimize the lawsuit by saying that  as per his track record  spicer actually only continued to be a national embarrassment what truly is interesting about the case  is that it is being filed by two government officials  trump s crony corporate administration would absolutely love for the public not recognize that this may prove to be one of the most important lawsuits in this nation s history  given that it will provide likely provide a more concrete legal definition as to what is considered an emolument  never before has a president been charged successfully as being in violation of the emolument clause  the case could potentially lead to a whole new set of legal restrictions on the president s office featured image  photo by mark wilson getty images
