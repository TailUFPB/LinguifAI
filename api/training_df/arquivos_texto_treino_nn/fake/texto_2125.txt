donald trump has been vacationing at his mar a lago resort in florida nearly every weekend since taking office  and now palm beach county intends to force him him to pay for it the cost of trump s weekend forays have been devastating for local taxpayers and area businesses for two months now  they have had to deal with providing extra security  directing traffic  shutting down a local airport  and all the economic hazards trump has caused of course  trump doesn t care about the people he hurts as long as he gets to throw parties and golf on the taxpayer s dime so far  palm beach county has had to pony up    million for extra security when trump is in town and because of the extra security  businesses in palm beach are losing tens of thousands of dollars every weekend  causing many to literally go broke in fact  trump s weekend vacations has cost taxpayers on the national level over   million and counting and trump is on pace to play more golf and go on more vacations and spend more money on those vacations in a single year than president obama did during his whole eight years in office palm beach county residents and officials are especially tired of trump s visits  and they want their back  which trump has so far refused to reimburse so palm beach lawmakers are looking to classify mar a lago as a  municipal service benefit unit  so they can level a special tax on trump to force the money out of him county commissioner dave kerner is looking into this method to provide relief to local taxpayers who have had to deal with the burden  it s one thing for a president to visit once in awhile  but every weekend is ridiculous according to the palm beach post it could give the county a way to impose a special tax on trump to reimburse the county for the millions it has shelled out for roadway management and security assistance during the president s frequent trips here the tax would not be a property tax  kerner said  instead  it would be a tax pegged to the value of any  special benefit  the county has provided to mar a lago s owner   trump in other words  if trump wants to continue taking his little trips to florida  he ll have to pay the price  and that will at least give the residents of palm beach something to smile about when trump comes to town featured image  mario tama getty images
