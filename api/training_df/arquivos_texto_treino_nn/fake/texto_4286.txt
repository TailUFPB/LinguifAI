 i ll be back  is not what arnold schwarzenegger is telling the republican party this year  ever since the action movie icon became a united states citizen in  he has faithfully voted for the gop presidential candidate but not this year donald trump s vulgar remarks about groping women were too much for the terminator star  who  like other republicans  are now jumping from a sinking ship the los angeles times reports that arnold not only condemned trump in a statement  but used the same statement to announce that he will not be voting republican in november  for the first time since i became a citizen in   i will not vote for the republican candidate for president   schwarzenegger said in a statement posted on twitter  like many americans  i ve been conflicted by this election   i still haven t made up my mind about how exactly i will vote next month  i have been a proud republican since i moved to america in  and i heard nixon s words about getting government off our backs  free trade  and defending our liberty with a strong military  that day i joined the party of abraham lincoln  teddy roosevelt  and ronald reagan but as proud as i am to label myself a republican  there is one label that hold above all else   american  so i want to take a moment today to remind my fellow republicans that it is not only acceptable to choose your country over your party   it is your duty  as proud as i am to label myself a republican  there is one label that i hold above all else   american  my full statement  pic twitter com   arnold   schwarzenegger  october    governor of california  schwarzenegger was embroiled in his own scandals which included an affair he had with his housekeeper that produced a child years prior to taking office  which he has taken responsibility for  and accusations of sexual misconduct for which he has expressed remorse so donald trump s behavior and words are so bad that even schwarzenegger can t bring himself to vote republican  that s saying something featured image via wikimedia
