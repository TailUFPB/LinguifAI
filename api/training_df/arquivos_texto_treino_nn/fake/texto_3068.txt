this is how far republicans will go to protect a racist in their party thirty years after congress rejected jeff sessions  nomination as a federal judge  the alabama republican who only had a problem with the kkk because they smoked marijuana is once again up for a critical government post that could set voting rights back for generations donald trump s nomination of sessions as attorney general has raised alarm bells across the nation as civil rights groups fear he will gut the justice department  particularly the division that investigates and fights voting rights and civil rights violations as a federal attorney  sessions slapped voter fraud charges against black volunteers in his home state who were tasked with picking up and delivering absentee ballots to the post office so they could be counted  sessions lost the case  and no one was indicted because the volunteers did nothing wrong  sessions just hates black people and sees their voting as a crime even former colleagues testified that sessions is a racist according to the new york times in testimony before the committee  former colleagues said that mr  sessions had referred to the n a a c p   the southern christian leadership conference and other civil rights groups as  un american  and  communist inspired   an african american federal prosecutor then  thomas h  figures  said mr  sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that mr  sessions said the ku klux klan was fine  until i found out they smoked pot  if you still need proof that sessions is a racist  just consider that white supremacists cheered when trump announced his nomination but there is one piece of testimony that republicans have been suppressing for decades that would be a nail in the coffin of sessions  effort to become attorney general in   coretta scott king  the widow of martin luther king  jr   wrote a letter of testimony to the republican controlled judiciary committee that ended up rejecting sessions buzzfeed reports that racist senator strom thurmond refused to put the letter in the congressional record and the contents have been kept from public view ever since  but knight rider reporter aaron epstein published a piece of it in  that explains why we should not believe sessions when he claims he isn t racist  for a century  the racial practices that characterized our region were established and enforced by men who  like mr  sessions  protested that they  too  were not personally hostile to blacks   king wrote and that line alone should disqualify sessions from ever being more than a racist senator  because the last thing this country needs is a racist attorney general in charge of the very institution that investigates voter suppression  discrimination  and hate crimes against people of color featured image  wikimedia
