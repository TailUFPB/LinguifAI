graduates of university of notre dame s  class  conducted a walk out protest when vice president mike pence began his commencement speech  events like this are becoming regular for the team president trump put together  and there are likely to be many more   but you can t blame students for reacting and repelling officials with pasts like these  young people are paying attention to the policies and aren t enamored with a title  they are saying  bye  to trump s evil minions while serving as governor of indiana  mike pence did everything he could to make abortions impossible for women  this went along with attacks on female health and lgbt rights  the man signed a bill that allow businesses to discriminate against people based on their sexuality  so  when the university of notre dame invited him to give a commencement speech  the students did this one student  xitalaly estrada  when asked about the walkout said  initially when the invite went out  we were all a little more than hesitant to attend  especially because this administration has been denigrating people of color and minority groups  my parents are immigrants and they re in constant state of discomfort  i don t think my parents have ever felt comfortable in this country  my biggest concern was that this day  that was supposed to be for my family and their sacrifices that led me to be able to graduate from the university of notre dame  would be overshadowed by someone who has openly endorsed their denigration and has corroborated their marginalization as an immigrant group  as mexicans  as  at one point  people who worked in the fields  as people who work in the service sector  and they would have to hear that person speak at my commencement  many students who opposed the administrations stance on issues ranging from religion and race  and the vice president s specific prejudice against lgbt community stood and left the stadium earlier in the month  secretary of state  betsy devos received similar treatment at bethune cookman university  though  it got considerably uglier  students at the the historically black institution heckled her for most of the speech  the rest of the time  she spoke to a crowd of gowned backs  some with fists raised in protest  and it was only a  minute speech why a trump administration official who called hucu s  the pioneers of school choice  thought her speaking at one was appropriate is beyond rational  she actually thought segregation was the same as school choice  and her policies like the stripping of protections of student loan borrowers  her bosses threat to defund black colleges  and her attacks on public schools don t seem to be washed away by her kind words regarding civil rights leaders and her bosses liking of  the blacks   she left public schools in the city of detroit in ruins and plans to do the same all over the country   students just want her policies to do the talking  not her as this year s graduation class moves on  it will be interesting to see whether those in the trump administration steer clear of the stage  if not  they might have to get accustomed to young people who reject their policies and would choose to never walk across the stage over listening to them speak featured image via drew angerer getty images
