i can only imagine that the stack of resumes on donald trump s desk is full of spelling errors  which to the most anti intellectual administration in recent american history  is certainly not a disqualifier  at least if we judge by the communications coming from the white house over the last three weeks the horrendous spelling came early  during the campaign  trump regularly misspelled words on his tweets  that hasn t changed  shortly before trump s inauguration  he tweeted about china  and managed to misspell the word  unprecedented   he eventually fixed it  but it took nearly an hour and a half more recently  though  trump s education secretary  betsy devos tweeted about w e b  du bois  but instead of spelling it the way the civil rights leader and founder of the naacp did  her tweet  which happened to fall during black history month  spelled his name debois the department fairly quickly apologized  but not without misspelling  apologies   yes  that came from the department in charge of educating our children in another embarrassing misspelling  this one a bit more tactile than a tweet  trump s inaugural poster also has a misspelling president trump s official inauguration portrait offered by the library of congress had a glaring typo on it  social media users pointed out sunday evening the print of trump  which was sold on the library of congress s website  includes a quote from the president   but misspells  too  as  to  no dream is too big  no challenge is to great  nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach   the quote reads on the poster source  the hillthe poster has been taken off the website  but not before some screenshots were taken is this a big deal in the overall scheme of things  not really  but it does show a frightening trend within the trump administration  no dedication to detail in a job where every single word matters  for example  it s been widely reported that trump doesn t even read the executive orders he s pushing out on nearly a daily basis  he even signed away much of his power to the neo nazi steve bannon for the moment  mr  bannon remains the president s dominant adviser  despite mr  trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the national security council  a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban source  gqif that sort of sloppiness  from the office of arguably the most powerful man in the world  doesn t terrify you  then nothing will featured image via mario tama getty images
