if a grand jury indicts donald trump  one fox news host wants conservatives to revolt in retaliation when robert mueller impaneled a grand jury to hear evidence in trump s russia scandal  it was a huge deal should trump get indicted  he would be the first president to get indicted richard nixon and bill clinton were nearly indicted but special prosecutors waited for impeachment proceedings instead  nixon resigned before he could be impeached and was subsequently pardoned by geral ford  clinton s impeachment trial ended in his favor  so ken starr abandoned the indictment effort trump  however  is not being impeached at the moment because republicans still refuse to do their constitutional duty  so the next best thing is a criminal indictment  which could be slapped against trump or any member of his family if the grand jury sees fit to do so that s going to depend on the evidence  of which there is plenty thanks to donald trump jr   who released emails confirming that trump s campaign colluded with russia during the  election fox news host jeanine pirro all but directly threatened bloody violence if the grandy jury indicts trump or any member of his family  even if the evidence proves one or all of them broke the law  i m sure this is on donald s mind  he never stops thinking   pirro began   but at the same time  this is an agenda  pirro then warned that an  uprising  will occur upon indictment  here is my concern  if they end up with an indictment against a family member  just to get at donald trump because they couldn t get at him  there is going to be a real uproar  a real uprising in this country  pirro then accused mueller of rigging the grand jury against trump  i was a prosecutor for  years  you can indict a ham sandwich  the only person in that grand jury is the district attorney who is interacting with all of those grand jurors on what the law is   and the body language is clear  here s the video via twitter   judgejeanine  there will be an uproar in this country if they end up with an indictment against a trump family member just to get at potus pic twitter com   fox   friends   foxandfriends  august    indicting somebody is that easy  one wonders why so many police officers have been let off the hook by grand juries in recent years  indeed  grand juries have failed to indict in clear cases where police officers murdered unarmed black men  just look at the eric garner case for example  garner was strangled to death just for allegedly selling cigarettes  the grand jury in that case decided not to indict the officer who killed him even though garner s death was ruled a homicide the evidence was clear  garner s death was even caught on film  it should have been enough to send the police officer to prison  instead  the grand jury chose to indict the man who filmed garner s murder clearly  pirro is wrong about grand juries pirro is also wrong to incite an  uprising  just because the walls of justice are closing in on trump and his crime family  this amounts to a threat against the grand jury  which could be seen as interference  pirro is literally telling the grand jury to absolve trump or face possible violent retribution  that s unacceptable and robert mueller should question pirro for it she may be a former judge and prosecutor  but tampering with a grand jury in this way is still a crime she could be punished for featured image  screenshot
