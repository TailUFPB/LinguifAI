president bone spurs finally made it to vietnam over  years too late this week  and he used the occasion to stab our intelligence community in the back again while taking questions from reporters on air force one  donald trump was asked if he still believes vladimir putin s denial that russia interfered with the  election even though the evidence proves that russia meddled of course  trump is putin s puppet so he was quick to throw u s  officials and u s  agencies under a speeding bus to side with the russian dictator  he said he didn t meddle  he said he didn t meddle   trump said   i asked him again  you can only ask so many times  i just asked him again  he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election  he did not do what they are saying he did  as we all know   agencies  including the fbi and cia agree that russian interfered with the  election  there is so much evidence that trump is being investigated for colluding with russia  not only by a special prosecutor  but by congress as well we also know that trump s own son met with kremlin connected russian officials at trump tower seeking their help  not long after that meeting  trump urged russia to hack hillary clinton s emails and the dnc trump went on to claim that the  whole thing was set up by the democrats  and desperately defended putin again  every time he sees me he says i didn t do that and i really believe that when he tells me that  he means it  but he says i didn t do that  i think he is very insulted by it  if you want to know the truth  don t forget  all he said was he never did that  he didn t do that  i think he is very insulted by it  which is not a good thing for our country  then trump attacked the intelligence community officials who have testified under oath that russia meddled with our democratic process  they re political hacks  so you look at it  and then you have brennan  you have clapper and you have comey  comey s proven now to be a liar and he s proven to be a leaker  so you look at that  and you have president putin very strongly  vehemently says he had nothing to do with that  and there you have it  trump would rather believe the word of a russian dictator over the word of several high ranking american officials who spent most of their lives dedicated to keeping america and our democratic institutions safe that alone should outrage the american people featured image  steffen kugler  bpa via getty images
