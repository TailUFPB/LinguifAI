the trump campaign is definitely a racist one  because the guy at the helm of the whole thing  donald trump  is a flaming racist  after all  as we all know  donald trump s first entrance into mainstream american politics was his very public leading of a charge to prove that president obama was not born in this country  that issue keeps coming up now  during this campaign  because trump s surrogates have been all over the television airwaves insisting that he is no longer a birther  however  when trump himself was asked by the washington post whether or not he actually believes that the president is an american  he refused to answer  just giving the standard answer that he no longer discusses the issue well  seeing that things were about to get ugly surrounding this  trump s campaign issued a gross  racist statement full of self congratulations and outright lies  as if trump s questioning of the president s birth was in any way a service to the country or in any way appropriate  the statement begins by refusing to admit any wrong doing on the part of trump and his fellow birthers  and instead suggesting that trump s racist  show me your papers  campaign was somehow the right thing to do  in   mr  trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling president obama to release his birth certificate  mr  trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that hillary clinton and her team first raised  then  trump spokesman jason miller  the despicable goon behind this travesty of a statement  closes the whole thing off by acting like the public questioning of the origins of the first black american president is some kind of golf course deal trump closed  inarguably  donald j  trump is a closer  having successfully obtained president obama s birth certificate when others could not  mr  trump believes that president obama was born in the united states  no  you guys aren t getting off this easy  miller  the only acceptable response here is to have your candidate say  from his own mouth  that he knows that he was wrong  that he is sorry  and that president obama is an american and a legitimate president  nothing less will do  further  you will have to retract this deplorable statement  and admit that everything you have said here is awful  that it was not hillary clinton s campaign who started or led the birther movement  and that it was donald trump himself who gave it legs i won t hold my breath on any of that  though  after all  hillary was right  you folks really are a basket of deplorables   and you just got even deplorable with this statement featured image via alex wong getty images
