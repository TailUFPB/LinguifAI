keith olbermann rants on a very regular basis  tonight s rant  on his video series  was extremely on point given that trump will give a state of the union esque address to congress this evening where he will likely talk about one of our biggest controversies  immigration he spends most of the address calling trump s immigration orders a  muslim ban   and a  purge of hispanics   he s not wrong  and he lays out exactly why he s not wrong with example after example  when you detain an american born in philadelphia and ask him over and over again   where did you get your name from   and   are you muslim   and the man s name is muhammad ali jr   it s a muslim ban  when ice agents reportedly wait across the street from a virginia church refuge designed to save the homeless from freezing to death on our streets  and you grab six men as they leave the place  it is a purge of hispanics  he goes back and forth between  muslim ban   and  purge of hispanics   through his rant  with each example of the truth of these words worse than the one before  a couple of his examples have background to them that he doesn t lay out  which makes them misleading  however  the gist of the entire video is the truth he also explains that one of the biggest things trump s stance on immigration has done is start turning rank and file ice and u s  customs and border protection officers  and u s  border patrol agents   who may not even know any better   into power tripping sadists under the false belief that they re still doing something moral but his final sentence is the kicker  watch his entire rant below new  that is a muslim ban  this is a hispanic purge  and they are trump s gestapo pic twitter com   keith olbermann   keitholbermann  march    image via screen capture from embedded video
