it can easily be said that donald trump has absolutely no idea what he is doing in regards to policy both domestic and foreign  he s a blundering fool who belongs nowhere near the oval office  and maybe he knows this considering how much time he spends away from it at his resorts while many are commenting on the order given by trump to deliver airstrikes on a syrian airbase  one person who knows probably more than anyone about geopolitics weighed in with their opinion  that person is former secretary of state hillary clinton clinton actually agreed that action needed to be taken and hours before trump gave the order  she suggested hitting syrian airfields  she said  i really believe that we should have and still should take out his air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them  however  trump s strikes were ineffective at stopping anything  and unlike the  president  clinton actually knows that a plan of follow up action needs to take place  she also knows that trump can t say he cares about the slaughter of innocent children  but then also deny them refuge in the united states  it s hypocritical  to say the least while speaking at the women in the world conference in texas  clinton said  i hope this administration will move forward in a way that is both strategic and consistent with our values   and i also hope that they will recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting syrian babies and in the next close america s doors to them  and she is absolutely correct  trump s move in syria was purely symbolic  it was posturing and it did nothing but provide a different narrative for the news to talk about other than russia helping trump get elected it s going to be up to trump to move forward with an actual plan of action with syria  but don t hold your breath watch hillary clinton show what true leadership looks like here hillary clinton  us cannot  in one breath  speak of protecting syrian babies and close america s doors to them https   t co qlrmvvovhv pic twitter com   cnn   cnn  april    photo by justin sullivan getty images
