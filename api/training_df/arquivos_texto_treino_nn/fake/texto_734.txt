trump apparently will continue the feud he started with jeff sessions when he said he thought sessions had been very unfair in recusing himself from the russia investigation  he wants someone who is going to be  percent blindly loyal  meaning someone who will stop any and all investigations into him and his family and open investigations into hillary and the democrats   and clearly  sessions isn t it  so  according to one of trump s close advisers  he will torture sessions until he resigns he wants to fire him but he doesn t want the confrontation  he doesn t mind the long negative storyline  he will torture him every single day  when trump gets all butthurt like this  he focuses his ire on the perceived guilty party and doesn t let it go until they either cave or someone manages to convince him to let it go  sessions  thus far  has maintained that he will not resign  and  well  trump just can t have that according to politico  trump has been whining up one side and down the other about sessions  decision to recuse himself from the russia investigation to anyone who will listen  not only did trump say that was unfair to him  but he also said that  if he d known sessions was going to take the job and then recuse himself  he would never have  given  him the job in the first place  to trump  recusal in this situation is a grave abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of trust when the person doing so is supposed to be on trump s side  if they re an opponent  of course  they must recuse over the slightest possible conflict  sessions  for his part  doesn t seem to know what the problem is  one person close to him said that they ve spoken to people in the west wing and nobody understands why trump is doing this  but trump  never one to let go of a grudge until his enemy is completely vanquished  and sometimes  not even then   reportedly wants to see how sessions will respond to things like mockery and humiliation if sessions does resign  trump will eventually turn his ire on someone else  he wants sycophants  not people who will do their jobs featured image via michael reynolds and mark wilson getty images
