if you claim to be a  christian  but support donald trump and all the hate and bigotry he embodies  you re a hypocrite and that s exactly what michael moore told joy reid during her saturday morning show on msnbc ever since trump won the election on tuesday night his deplorable supporters have been terrorizing minorities and women across the country  causing fear and panic in communities to the point that a movement has begun in which people wear safety pins to signify to others that they are safe to be near but moore believes more has to be done  particularly by white people  white people  no matter how painful  have a responsibility to reject anybody who stands in front of a camera who spews racism  who spews sexism  misogyny  who brags about being a sexual predator  i don t care what your race is  but especially if you re white  because that means that you belong to the race that s been in power forever  this a country that was founded on genocide and built on the backs of slaves  so you have a special responsibility as a white person to always object to anybody who uses racism  who spews this hatred  moore the wondered how white americans will feel when they wake up one morning and realize that they ve been shitty human beings because they did nothing when they had a chance to stand against the hate  and that led to moore calling out white people who call themselves  christian  and do not call yourself a christian if you are not willing  literally  to put your body in front of whoever is coming to hurt the other   the people who are not you  here s the video via twitter mmflint on the special responsibility he says white people have during  donaldtrump presidency  amjoy https   t co   am joy w joy reid   amjoyshow  november    is absolutely right  because of trump  the responsibility falls on white people to stand up against the racism  sexism  bigotry  and hate that he has incited against any american who isn t white or christian  so whenever we see these behaviors we need to be brave and take a stand because being silent isn t an option featured image  screenshot
