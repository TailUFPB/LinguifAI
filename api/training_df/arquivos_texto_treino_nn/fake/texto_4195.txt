another bit of news from the past has come back to haunt donald trump s already imploding campaign only days after an entertainment tonight clip went viral showing donald trump talking about how he will be dating the  year old girl he just met in ten years  the chicago tribune dug into their own archives to find another disturbing news blurb quoting trump speaking to a pair of  year old girls in   in a december  wire brief in the chicago tribune  trump is described as having spotted a youth choir singing christmas carols at the plaza hotel in manhattan   the tribune reported   he asked two girls how old they were  when they said they were   trump  then   replied   wow  just think   in a couple of years  i ll be dating you  here s the news clipping via the chicago tribune  the bit about trump is at the lower right hand corner under the yellow highlight there you have it  donald trump jumped from disgustingly talking about him dating a  year old girl in ten years to directly telling two  year old girls that he will be dating them in two years  for the record  both girls would still be considered minors under the law  furthermore  trump s own daughter ivanka was  years old at the time  which makes these revelations even creepier trump has been under fire for over a week now since his remarks about groping women came to light  accusations of sexual assault from multiple women  including miss teen usa contestants who have revealed that trump walked in on them in their dressing room to see them naked  have flooded the media ever since and the republican nominee is struggling to explain himself and his predatory behavior these revelations also give more credibility to a child rape case that trump is currently embroiled in  which goes to a status conference in december that trump must attend  the lawsuit was filed by a woman only known as jane doe  who says trump raped her in  when she was  years old and given the fact that trump apparently likes openly hitting on underage girls  it sounds like jane doe has a case donald trump is a sick man and a pervert who should not be anywhere close to being president of the united states  but republicans chose him to be their leader and now america is living a nightmare that can only end if trump and the gop loses by a total landslide on november  featured image  spencer platt getty images
