well  it happened  folks  jon stewart made yet another triumphant return just in time for the election  and he definitely had a message to share   do not elect donald trump while making an appearance on the late show with his old pal stephen colbert  the duo made sure the clear message of making sure trump loses was front and center stewart appeared as the  mayor of candytown  in an effort to get out the vote the hilarious sketch showed how shocked stewart was to hear that trump had  in fact  been elected as the republican nominee  then  when the little orphan in the sketch tried to say she didn t know which nominee was worse  trump or hillary clinton  colbert and stewart shouted  he s worse   very loudly in unison making a surprise appearance was none other than broadway s new  hamilton  star javier mu oz  to again drive the point home to get out and vote it has become more apparent than ever that pretty much all of sane america knows that donald trump cannot be allowed anywhere near the oval office  however  to make sure he s never even remotely near the white house  everyone  and i mean everyone  has to get out and vote in the meantime  watch all the hilarity go down here feature image via video screen capture
