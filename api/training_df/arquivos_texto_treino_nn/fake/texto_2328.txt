ever since the courts blocked donald trump s ridiculous muslim ban  the white house has been saying that they will fight it all the way  that the ban would be back in short order  however  the trump administration keeps putting it off  now  it seems that the ban may not happen at all the rachel maddow show has obtained a document from the department of homeland security that essentially says that the travel ban based upon nationality has absolutely nothing to do with protecting the nation from terrorist attacks  in fact  the new document says that most extremists are brainwashed into their ideology right here on american soil  they generally tend to be citizens and legal residents  so  in other words  there is absolutely no reason to ban people based upon nationality  couple that with the fact that trump and those in his orbit are openly anti muslim  and one can only conclude that this  travel ban  is nothing but an attempt to make trump s call to keep muslims out of the country pass constitutional muster even more damning is the fact that the chaos caused by the clumsy roll out of trump s original executive order regarding this matter  and we can only come to the conclusion that trump will again be met with resistance from the courts if he tries to do this again watch the report below featured image via erik mcgregor pacific press lightrocket via getty images
