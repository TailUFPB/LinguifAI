trump s transition is humming right along now  complete with an ever growing cabinet full of everyone he promised america he was going to get out of government  one of his latest picks is a major supporter of big oil  scott pruitt  who s also oklahoma s current attorney general  pruitt is busy suing the epa and now he s going to head it no  really  trump has tapped pruitt to head an agency he s suing over obama s rule to bring down carbon emissions  sure   other states are part of that lawsuit  but the fact that one of the participants in that suit has been chosen to lead it  well  that s a huge conflict of interest  pruitt could render the agency toothless of course  environmentalists are upset with this decision  and they should be  rhea su  who heads the natural resources defense council  said in a statement  the mission of the epa and its administrator requires an absolute commitment to safeguard public health and protect our air  land  water and planet  that s the litmus test  by naming pruitt  president elect trump has flunked  exactly  trump says he wants clean air and water and that s why he won t get rid of the epa  but ensuring clean air and water means actually acknowledging science and using that to craft policy  pruitt however  thinks whether climate change is man made is still up in the air  and said so in the new york times  healthy debate is the lifeblood of american democracy  and global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates of our time that debate is far from settled  scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind  dissent is not a crime  no  dissent is not a crime  yes  healthy debate is a good thing  refusing to acknowledge that science says the debate is pretty much over is a bad thing  obviously pruitt wants his lawsuit to succeed  but now he might be able to drop or gut that rule so they win without having to worry about the d c  circuit court of appeals  where it s currently pending pruitt has to be confirmed and democrats are starting to signal that they can t  in good conscience  confirm pruitt because of what the epa s mission is  can they actually block his appointment  though  it depends on whether they can convince a few republicans to oppose him  too featured image via spencer platt getty images
