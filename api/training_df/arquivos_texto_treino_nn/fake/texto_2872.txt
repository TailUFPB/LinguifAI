women in texas may have to literally fight for their freedom and their lives to make sure this republican lawmaker doesn t get his way during the presidential campaign in   donald trump actually mentioned jail and stated that women should receive  some form of punishment  for having an abortion well  texas gop rep  tony tinderholt has introduced house bill   which would punish any woman for having an abortion with prison time  the legislation contains zero exceptions for rape victims  victims of incest  and women who have to have an abortion to save their lives during an interview with the texas observer  tinderholt claimed that women use abortion as a form of birth control and that they are not  personally responsible  when they choose to have sex  right now  it s real easy   tinderholt said   right now  they don t make it important to be personally responsible because they know that they have a backup of  oh  i can just go get an abortion   now  we both know that consenting adults don t always think smartly sometimes  but consenting adults need to also consider the repercussions of the sexual relationship that they re gonna have  which is a child  tinderholt went on to interject his religious beliefs as one of his reasons for writing the legislation  stating that women should be forced to carry pregnancies to term because he s  a firm believer that god creates children in his own image  regardless of how that child is brought into the world  it s created in his image  and how can someone want to destroy that  the conservative lawmaker hopes to ban abortion by threatening women with the punishment of prison make no mistake  this is the most dangerous and extreme piece of anti abortion legislation that has been filed across the nation and it would literally punish women for making decisions about their own reproductive health  the punishment could even extend to women who take birth control pills since many conservatives believe that contraceptives are a form of abortion  even though such medication prevents conception in the first place  it also could punish women who have natural miscarriages  the fact that republicans even want to jail rape victims for refusing to carry their rapist s baby is also monstrous and now we know why tony tinderholt has been divorced four times  clearly  the women in his life can t stand him featured image  woman survival
