now that they have someone they think is their lord and savior in the white house  house republicans are starting to come together on their plans to get rid of the affordable care act  they ve been bleating  repeal and replace  for six years  but the  replace  part of that has always been a secondary concern  as in  they never really tried to work on it   now they re solidifying that with a  repeal and delay  plan or  rather   repeal and let the sh t hit the fan  plan  they still have no plan for replacing it  but they just have to repeal now so that s what they re going to do  then they ll delay actually nullifying it because they think that will keep the whole of the country from descending a dark staircase into chaotic healthcare hell  rep  kevin brady  chairman of the house ways and means committee  even said  we are not going to rip health care away from americans  we will have a transition period so congress can develop the right policies and the american people can have time to look for better health care options  because congress can totally agree on everything that needs to happen for americans to have decent access to decent healthcare  their delusion on this is deep and complex  too  house majority leader kevin mccarthy believes that  once it s officially repealed  fewer people will want to play politics and more will be willing to come to the table and support a republican solution har de har har  the gop s very narrow majority in the senate could make that all but a pipe dream  no matter  the house has a plan for that too  according to lamar alexander  the chairman of the house s health committee  we re going to begin immediately to repeal obamacare and reconciliation is the only way to do it  and i believe we will have  republican senators or  to vote for that  no  republicans aren t playing politics at all here is it really going to be so bad  though  well  yes  actually  it probably will be  experts are warning that this  repeal and delay  plan is going to cause massive chaos  sabrina corlette  who teaches at the health policy institute at georgetown  said  the idea that you can repeal the affordable care act with a two  or three year transition period and not create market chaos is a total fantasy  insurers need to know the rules of the road in order to develop plans and set premiums  if there are problems  they ll just blame democrats for stalling  for refusing to play ball  for obstructing  or whatever else they think the public will believe if spoon fed to them  see  they ve solved everything  except how to replace the aca  their only focus is on repealing right now  it s not likely they re actually thinking beyond being able to brag to the masses that they finally got rid of the aca featured image by zach gibson via getty images
