seriously  this actually happened in america milk costs  cents at graham park middle school in prince william county  virginia  but like millions of other children across the country  ryan turk is enrolled in the free lunch program because his family can t afford his meals one day after going through the lunch line  turk sat down and realized that he had forgotten to grab a milk so he went back and grabbed one like any other kid would do except that ryan turk is black  so the school security guard automatically assumed he stole it  he confronted ryan  accused him of a crime  and demanded that he go to the principal s office  ryan refused because he did nothing wrong rather than check out ryan s story  which would have been as simple as looking at his tray and realizing that he only had one milk  which he would have known was free for ryan if he had bothered to check if he is enrolled to get free school lunches   the security officer arrested him and charged him with disorderly conduct and petty larceny  charges that will now be on ryan s record the school gave turk a choice  enroll in a diversion program by admitting to a crime he didn t commit  or face a trial in a courtroom again  this is all because ryan went back for the milk he forgot as part of his lunch  it s a  cent milk for crying out loud  not the mona lisa rightfully so  ryan s mother rejected the first choice   my son is not going to admit to something he did not do   she told the washington post turk and his mother also contend that race has something to do with the incident because ryan has seen many other students do the exact same thing he did without being confronted by school security the school has dismissed the accusation that racism had anything to do with the situation because the security guard and the principal are both black  but turk s attorney emmett robinson begs to differ  it s not the players  it s not the people who discriminate  it s the whole system   robinson said   the system is set up now so that school resource officers get to determine the impact on a person s life  indeed  treating black kids like criminals has ended up creating a vicious cycle that has resulted in the disproportionate imprisonment of blacks in this country there is little doubt that if ryan had been white he would have never been approached by the security officer the fact is that ryan turk was entitled to have a milk with his lunch  which is free  he just forgot it and merely did what he has seen other students do  security did not have a problem with those other kids going back for their forgotten milk  so why did the security officer treat ryan differently  race must have played a role  and even if it didn t  having a child arrested over a  cent carton of milk is absolutely ridiculous  it s a waste of resources and a waste of the court s time surely  the school and the judiciary must have more important things to deal with featured image via wikimedia
