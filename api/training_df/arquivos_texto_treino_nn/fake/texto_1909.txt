republicans are desperately trying to convince everyone that what they did to merrick garland was totally normal on sunday  mitch mcconnell pathetically defended his party s refusal to hold a confirmation hearing for president obama s supreme court nominee by repeating the claim that it s senate  tradition  to not confirm nominees during an election year  he also made the childish claim that republicans did it because democrats would have done it  even though democrats have never done such a thing what republicans did to merrick garland was unprecedented and a total disgrace of the constitution but orrin hatch picked up where mcconnell left off by using the same pathetic defense during an interview on cnn monday after being asked about what republicans will do if democrats block trump s supreme court nominee neil gorsuch  hatch whined and accused democrats of  politicizing  the confirmation process  while pretending that his own party didn t politicize it throughout  when they refused to even grant garland a hearing  they re politicizing this whole process   hatch said   this is a guy who is a mainstream conservative  which they hate  they don t like that  and of course  they are still upset about my other friend  merrick garland  but the republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential year  cnn host john berman called out hatch s hypocrisy  but they look at you and say that s a double standard   berman responded   you call judge gorsuch one of the most qualified judges ever to be nominated  almost everyone said the same thing about merrick garland  including you  indeed  in   hatch referred to garland as a  consensus nominee  and said there is  no question  that he would be easily confirmed to the high court if nominated  garland even complained in support of garland in  by whining about president obama s choice before garland was chosen  the president told me several times he s going to name a moderate   but i don t believe him   could easily name merrick garland  who is a fine man  he probably won t do that because this appointment is about the election  so i m pretty sure he ll name someone the  wants  president obama made hatch choke on those words by picking garland  so there seems to be a double standard where you re saying  it was alright last year when we for political reasons halted the nomination of merrick garland   berman continued   but it s not okay this year when democrats try to halt the nomination of judge gorsuch  hatch responded to berman by lashing out with a desperate defense of how republicans behaved in  towards garland  i ll just tell you straight up  that s total b s    hatch said   i can t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a supreme court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed  and both sides didn t agree  it was every right of  and senate republicans to say we re not going to do this in a presidential year  and at that time  keep in mind  it looked as though hillary was a sure winner and we would have gotten an even more liberal judge than that one  but that was a stand on principle  not some new barbaric thing that some have tried to make it  here s the video via youtube let s make something clear  what hatch and his fellow republicans in the senate did to merrick garland was totally unprecedented  they not only rejected garland after previously praising him  they even refused to grant him a confirmation hearing  that has never happened  republicans were so unbelievably partisan that antonin scalia s body was not even cold yet when they declared that they would refuse to confirm any nominee picked by president obama  and that brings us yet again to the republican claim that it s  tradition  for the senate to not confirm supreme court nominees during an election year that s complete bullshit  as it turns out  the last one occurred only  years ago when the senate confirmed justice anthony kennedy in  during ronald reagan s last year in office it also happened in  when dwight eisenhower nominated william brennan  the senate confirmed him despite it being an election year in   also an election year  franklin roosevelt nominated frank murphy to the supreme court and the senate confirmed him so contrary to republican claims  the tradition is that nominees can be and are confirmed despite whether it s an election year or not that means hatch is lying to cover his ass because he knows he and his fellow republicans are complete hypocrites and now that their hypocrisy is coming back to bite them on the ass they want to play the victim featured image via screenshot
