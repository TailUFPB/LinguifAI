has anyone else noticed that the government sometimes seems to like awarding contracts to companies that have proven they re incapable of doing what they re supposed to be doing  equifax s massive data breach affected most americans with any kind of credit at all  and here comes the irs to give equifax a contract in the name of  fraud prevention  because equifax has proven that they re awesome at protecting our data  oh  and then they proved that they were totally and completely transparent and on their consumers  sides when they tried to yank away our right to sue by encouraging all of us to enroll in their own fraud protection program with very fine print binding us to arbitration the contract  which is a    million contract to verify our identities and prevent fraud  is a  sole source order   which means the irs decided equifax was the only company capable of doing this for them  supposedly this is to help prevent an interruption in id verification while officials try and resolve something else equifax s security breach involved sensitive information for over  million americans  including our social security numbers  congressman greg walden of oregon likened the breach to the guards at fort knox forgetting to lock the doors  that s how bad this hack was the irs itself isn t exactly free of security issues  either  they ve had severe problems with tax id fraud and other data hacks  senator orrin hatch  of the senate finance committee  has said he s worried the irs doesn t have the technology necessary  to safeguard the integrity of our tax administration system  well  it seems equifax doesn t either  and yet the irs is giving up our information to them for  fraud prevention  the house digital commerce and consumer protection subcommittee called equifax  stupid   and said they  deserve to be shamed   and called the breach  shocking  and  unprecedented   walden also said  how does this happen when so much is at stake  i don t think we can pass a law that can fix stupid  apparently they can t regulate the stupid of the irs  either  we should all cross our fingers and pray nothing else happens to our data now  that s literally about all we can do featured image via scott olson getty images
