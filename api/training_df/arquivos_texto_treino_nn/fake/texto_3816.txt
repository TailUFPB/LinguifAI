if anyone had any deluded designs that donald trump wasn t going to stack his staff with racists  they were sadly mistaken  trump has named steve bannon  the guy who runs the alt right website breitbart  as his chief strategist  paul ryan went on television this morning and tried to say that the trump administration and the republican party do not condone racism and hate  but all of that just went out the window with this appointment  here is video of that interaction with cnn s jake tapper the trump campaign released the following statement regarding trump s appointments   and of course it doesn t address the fact that bannon is a bona fide racist   i am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country  steve and reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory  now i will have them both with me in the white house as we work to make america great again  so  in other words  trump and his team are in no way concerned about the racist hate crimes that have been cropping up around the country as a result of trump s getting elected  if the gop wants the nation and world to think that they are not racists  this is definitely not the way to do it  trump himself is a racist  and bannon is a huge racist as well buckle your seatbelts  folks  there s no way this country isn t going to devolve into a pit of hate with these people running it featured image via joe raedle getty images
