as more and more leaks get out  it s obvious that donald trump is not just a dictator  he s so insecure that aides have to hand him daily pacifiers in the form of fake and flattering news stories to keep the man baby from having even more twitter meltdowns the key to keeping trump s twitter habit under control  according to six former campaign officials  is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise  and when no such praise was to be found  staff would turn to friendly outlets to drum some up   and make sure it made its way to trump s desk  if candidate trump was upset about unfair coverage  it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable   said former communications director sam nunberg   the same media that our base digests and prefers is going to be the base for his support  i would assume the president would like to see positive and preferential treatment from those outlets and that would help the operation overall  source  politicoapparently trump s constant accusations of  fake news  has some legitimacy  but not how trump or his supporters would like trump is quite selective about where he gets his news  he does read print  like the new york times  but he also watches a lot   a lot   of fox news  remember when trump touted a terrorist attack in sweden that never happened  that allegedly came straight from fox news my statement as to what s happening in sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on  foxnews concerning immigrants   sweden   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    was a fake story  we can t say whether it was planted by trump s aides  but it might as well have been for all the anti immigrant political fodder it provided the ramifications of a president who has to be sheltered from the real news are chilling  as the administration rolls on  trump will continue to make adversaries around the world and in the media  trump s unfiltered twitter habit is potentially a national security issue  his aides obviously see this  but a president who is completely out of touch with reality  and is only willing to acknowledge fawning praise is equally dangerous featured image via pool getty images
