jake tapper has just about had it with donald trump  the feisty host of cnn s the lead infamously took trump s top liar spin doctor  white house counsel kellyanne conway  through a wood chipper for lying to him on air  and even banned her from his show briefly  he also rails trump daily  friday s subject  how much trump is costing taxpayers with his weekly trips to his swanky florida resort  mar a lago tapper first played the line in one of trump s speech where he insisted that he and his staff would  do a lot more with less  for the american people  tapper says after the clip  do a lot more with less  presidents are certainly entitled to take a day off  but any deficit hawk would ask  is a weekly visit to palm beach doing a lot more with less  it takes marine one  air force one  and motorcades to get the president to his posh oceanside estate  along with intense secret service protection  there happens to be another presidential retreat  much closer and cheaper   that of course would be camp david  it s already set up to be a working white house  and has security protocols in place  some presidents used the maryland site more than others  but camp david is costing taxpayers millions to maintain  while it sits dormant  then  tapper hands it over to another cnn reporter  and informs us that trump s weekly trips have already cost us more than   million in just the five weeks he s been in office this is outrageous  isn t there a way the secret service or someone can inform trump that this isn t his money  or his private plane  that others are paying for this   most of them being people who absolutely despise him  tapper is right to call trump out  and it doesn t look like it will be stopping anytime soon watch the epic rant below featured image via scott eisen getty images
