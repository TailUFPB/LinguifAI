before donald trump stepped foot in the white house  america was a well respected country  now  in just a few short months  the country has become a global laughingstock and trump only continues to pour salt in the wound each day most americans   especially the majority that voted against him   are embarrassed beyond belief to witness what is happening in congress and in the trump administration  however  the actual data might surprise some  thanks to a poll by quinnipiac university  we now know just how bad americans are suffering under our new undeserving president  the poll reported  american voters say     percent that they are embarrassed rather than proud to have trump as president  voters say     percent he is abusing the powers of his office and say     percent that he believes he is above the law  the hilarious thing is that trump is already running his reelection campaign for    because he believes he actually has a chance  if america is currently this disappointed in trump s performance  we can only imagine how eager the country will be to kick trump out of the white house if he lasts his full term these results show that more than ever  trump is a national embarrassment  trump is historically unpopular   not even former presidents barack obama and george w  bush were considered to be a humiliation by voters no one can take trump seriously as the leader of the free world  and no one has any respect for him   and because of that  trump has no real power  the entire country is fed up with his childish antics and the way he has disgraced america s reputation  not even members of his own party will help him get things done  trump s own voters are now turning their backs on him and regretting their choice for potus  at this point  trump has only been able to deliver one campaign promise   to unify america  against him  featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
