as trump s first  days in office come to a close  the administration is desperate to put together a list of accomplishments that looks like a showcase of trump s sheer leadership prowess  this desperation comes because trump has accomplished pretty much nothing at all  most of those so called  accomplishments  are executive orders that do squat  he hasn t managed to get any legislation through congress at all  and his approval rating is at a record low  percent other presidents fared much better during their first  days  and some people  like jimmy carter s presidential library  won t hesitate to needle trump with their own statistics  observe jimmy carter s first  days  laws passed   executive orders   approval rating   percent  jimmy carter library   carterlibrary  april    contrast  trump has signed  executive orders that he s claiming are accomplishments  such as a federal hiring freeze  wow  putting a halt to hiring federal workers is so difficult  is it not he s also trumpeting his job creation  successes   which include greenlighting both the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines  and his  buy american  hire american  initiative  neither of these orders is really going to accomplish anything  nor will his  buy american steel  initiative considering that the pipelines have long since purchased their steel  and most of it isn t american he s touting the wall as an accomplishment too  even though congress isn t likely to fund it  and he s listing his muslim ban  which has been halted in federal court and has likewise done nothing indeed  all he can really claim as an accomplishment at all is getting neil gorsuch confirmed to the supreme court  carter had a tumultuous first  days  too  but at least he managed to get an economic stimulus package through congress  trump hasn t gotten any major legislation through at all featured image by molly riley pool via getty images
