a chicago man is in critical condition after the mother of all epic f ckups by trump s  deportation force   on monday morning  ice agents raided the home of felix torres  it is unclear why they would choose to raid the home   not a single person inside is undocumented   but apparently  we are not too concerned about accuracy when we kick down brownish people s doors in trump s america at approximately   a m   immigration agents entered the home  refusing to tell any of the residents why they were there  according to officials  torres pulled a gun on the armed men who had forced their way into his home and refused to explain their presence   torres  family says that s utter hogwash  they didn t say anything  they just came in and pointed pistols in our faces and dragged us out   torres  daughter carmen says  noting that she was not even allowed to dress or grab milk for her one year old daughter  who was sleeping when the armed men invaded the home   it s a lie when they say he was holding a gun  he doesn t even own a gun   she said   they shot my dad  they shot him  and i don t know why  at least eight family members were in the house at the time  including numerous children  according to carmen torres  the family has lived there for  at least  years  we re going to have to talk to cpd to find out if this was a coordinated effort  because if it was in any way  that raises concerns about us as a sanctuary city    ward alderman gilbert villegas said of the attack   is this our future in chicago with donald trump as president  the community s got to be nervous about this  and rightfully so  because you have a right to be in your own home without being intimidated   villegas says   i m conflicted because i haven t got all the details  yet  but from the way this has started to play out  it looks like an overstep by an overzealous ice agent who s just trying to follow trump s orders  ice officials say they were not at the home to arrest torres  though they will nor provide further details  the victim was taken to a nearby hospital where his condition is listed as critical  the shooting is being investigated  though we probably can not expect much in terms of a reasonable resolution to the situation featured image via facebook
