by now  the entire world is aware that donald trump spent his morning lashing out at morning joe hosts joe scarborough and mika brzezinski in a truly unhinged fashion   even by normal trumpian standards  he let loose in a crazy  misogynistic rant that accused brzezinski of begging to be invited to his new year s eve party  but essentially he said she was too ugly to be there   except in much worse terms  now  it seems that trump s social media man  dan scavino  is joining in the continued debasement of the white house with equally childish tweets  we will screenshot them here  in case he thinks better of these tweets and decides to delete them of course  this is all because joe and mika have the stones to do their jobs and call this abnormal  alarming presidency out for what it is  dangerous  unhinged  and terrible for the nation  of course  with trump being as thin skinned as he is  the biggest job of his staff is to make him feel good and to hit back at any and all criticism that might be thrown at the white house  and especially at trump himself these people have done irreversible damage to the office of the president  to america s standing in the world  and to the political climate and discourse in america  it will likely take us a generation to get back to where we were   if we ever do at all it s time to really think hard about what four years of this will do to our nation  hell  the damage he s already done is quite literally immeasurable featured image via frederick m  brown getty images
