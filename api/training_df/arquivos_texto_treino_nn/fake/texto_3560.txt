according to the washington post  sources close to the taiwanese government and the trump transition team confirm that the so called  spontaneous  congratulatory phone call from taiwan s president was anything but that  in fact  trump had been planning it for months the post reports donald trump s protocol breaking telephone call with taiwan s leader was an intentionally provocative move that establishes the incoming president as a break with the past  according to interviews with people involved in the planning the historic communication   the first between leaders of the united states and taiwan since    was the product of months of quiet preparations and deliberations among trump s advisers about a new strategy for engagement with taiwan that began even before he became the republican presidential nominee  according to people involved in or briefed on the talks of course  members of trump s team  including mike pence are still insisting that this was nothing more than a congratulatory call  in an interview on abc s this week pence said  he took the call  accepted her congratulations and good wishes and it was precisely that  watch though many critics have dismissed trump s break in protocol with taiwan as nothing more than an idiotic mistake made by an unfit president elect  this new information may indicate that it was indeed an intentional move to show china that trump isn t going to hold to promises of the past and is somehow attempting to show china who s  boss   this need for trump to be in control could prove to be extremely dangerous and detrimental if china  also not known to enjoy losing  decides to cut off trade with the united states obviously  we can t say for certain that there will be any repercussions of that kind  but this is uncharted territory  the truth is  we just don t know what will happen  but if trump continues this behavior pattern  it s not just relations with china that we ll need to worry about  pretty soon the whole world is going to be pissed at us   if they aren t already featured image via getty ashley pon and ty wright
