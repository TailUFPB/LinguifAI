trump  who keeps promising to either scrap our trade deals  or at least aggressively renegotiate them  is mulling over all the people he could add to his nafta renegotiating team  he s apparently not looking for anyone who has diplomatic negotiating experience though  since he thinks negotiating is negotiating  noooo he actually wants ron burkle  co owner of the pittsburgh penguins  on this team because he believes burkle is great at negotiating the penguins were visiting the white house in the tradition of champion sports teams  where trump praised burkle s negotiating abilities and said  ron  how about negotiating some of our horrible trade deals that they ve made  here s what i want  i want to get him  oh  i would love to have ron burkle  and it s great to have you ron  but i really mean that  if you want to get involved in negotiating nafta  i like it  because we re renegotiating nafta  ron  the u s  is entering its fourth round of nafta talks  with canadian prime minister justin trudeau s visit to the u s  tomorrow overlapping that  trump hates nafta in part because he wants trade deals that are heavily even unfairly weighted in our direction  he has threatened to walk away from these talks because he s not getting what he wants worse  like the paris agreement and the trans pacific partnership  he thinks terminating our involvement in international agreements is the best way to get his idea of a good deal  i happen to think that nafta will have to be terminated if we re going to make it good  otherwise  i believe you can t negotiate a good deal  said the desert to the grain of sand  this is a man who has bankrupted so many businesses and hurt so many people that way that it s astonishing anyone thinks he s a great businessman  but hey  he made out nicely  so who cares what happened to everyone else this is how he sees our international agreements  including nafta  he doesn t understand international diplomacy at all and doesn t care to   so honestly  is it any wonder he wants the co owner of a hockey team to work on this  he s going to destroy our economy if he doesn t get other countries to destroy us with nukes first featured image via win mcnamee getty images
