trump really needs his twitter account permanently suspended  or someone needs to find a way to permanently lock him out of the platform  his tweets claiming credit for job creation he had nothing to do with  plus his blasting companies when they don t do what he wants  and his threat of a  percent  border tax   has businesses terrified of ending up on his radar and how are they responding  by repeating job announcements  or preemptively announcing new jobs and investments in the u s   as if they are new developments  in order to appease trump and generate fake news about  new  jobs  after trump blasted toyota on his twitter account  the industry was nervous and wondering who was next toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja  mexico  to build corolla cars for u s  no way  build plant in u s  or pay big border tax   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    s gone after lockheed martin and boeing  too  plus others  kristin dziczek  a spokeswoman for the center for automotive research said  pretty much everybody is dreading being the subject of a tweet  getting hauled out into the court of public opinion with virtually no warning is not something anybody wants to get engaged with  so they re doing the only thing they can think of to do  they re appeasing him  they ve been cowed  they ve been bullied  they ve been intimidated and coerced and it s ridiculous and disgusting most of the things they re announcing in the way of investment and job creation are things that are years in the making  for instance  gm admitted that they accelerated their plans under pressure from trump  but those plans very likely date back to  and gm has been bringing jobs back to the u s  for years already walmart s plans are their usual annual plans  sprint s jobs were part of an older promise from their parent company to create   jobs in the u s  and bayer and monsanto  if they re allowed to merge  will be investing and spending what they already invest and spend here still  though  trump has the entire corporate world running scared  if they were running scared in the right ways  this might actually be good  when they re acting because they re afraid of the president and his twitter account  there s a serious problem the automakers have started to time their announcements so that they appear to be trump s doing  for the sole purpose of staying out of his line of fire  other companies will probably start following suit  if for no other reason than to avoid having their reputations and stocks tank because trump had a snit on twitter featured image by drew angerer via getty images
