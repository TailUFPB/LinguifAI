this one s going to hurt  conservatives  so be prepared for it  you know how you have been triumphantly celebrating reports on gateway pundit  the same site that created a fake story about michael brown fracturing officer darren wilson s eye socket  and other right wing propaganda farms that the entire story about trump s campaign colluding with russia directly and trump hiring a couple of nice ladies to pee on his bed was manufactured by trolls on   sorry  guys  no such luck lying sh tbag and  dumbest man on the internet   google it  jim hoft writes according to  these documents were created by a  user and sent to anti trumper rick wilson knowing he would act on this tip  discussed this tonight    political hacks emailed documents to  nevertrump jackass rick wilson about trump making people piss on a bed     rick wilson thought it was real and gave it to leftists at the cia    the cia of the usa put this in their official classified intelligence report on russian involvement in the us election    donald trump and obama were both given private sessions with the cia to discuss this     the cia concluded that the russians plan to blackmail trump with this story we made upthe  users then link to this so they took what i told rick wilson and added a russian spy angle to it they still believe it  guys  they re truly fucking desperate   there s no remaining trump scandal that s credible then there s this  if these journalists were real journalists and not fake journalists then they would have found that the original documents did not conform to cia or uk intelligence requirements  it looks like the liberal mainstream media got punked   again   hoft celebrates in his latest drivel   if this is how easy it is to fool the liberal media then i m going to have my niece start sending them her harry potter fan fictions as long as she writes  confidential   sensitive source  at the top  the right wing  journalist s  fans chimed in  almost as ecstatic as donald trump watching some nice ladies pee upon hearing the news that the liberal media had fake newsed the benghazi or whatever their current lingo is  but not so fast  conservatives if the header is an issue  let s keep in mind that it has been made clear from the beginning that this report was not issued by   it was issued by someone who is former  and probably has his own style of header  that entire argument is dead from the get go  but the post is from november    you might say  yes  this is true that the post predates the full release of the information  but mother jones has been reporting on this for longer than that  in fact  it seems that the post in question was meant to discredit that much lighter report and has simply been repurposed as a matter of convenience  mother jones previously did not release the full details   including the  golden showers  bit   because it had not been confirmed  but has since done so as the information has been released elsewhere  but how could they know the source  then  if he was confidential   you ask as your eyes dart rapidly back and forth searching for something   anything   to salvage your ridiculous claim that internet trolls fooled multiple intelligence agencies  here s the thing   the post didn t identify the source  the post identified who the poster thought was the source  but wilson has been very clear he is not the source you re wrong if you   what we had came from  pol   that i was buzzfeed s source try again  boys   rick wilson   therickwilson  january    i ll settle it this way  if   arguendo   i had been their source  i hereby release the authors of the story  its editors  and buzzfeed generally from any off the record background protections of anonymity i would have asked for   wilson wrote in a long post regarding the allegations  no one has updated the story to name him as the source  so that s pretty well settled  naturally  he included a stab at conservatives for calling this  fake news  while believing actual fake news the real shame of this entire situation is that we re wasting valuable time trump could be using to uncover the real secrets of john podesta and hillary clinton s pizzagate global child kidnapping and cannibalism ring  you know  the important stuff  but  but  but   you stammer in desperation  fine  we ll just ask you to consider that the intelligence community does know the identity of the source  has worked with him in the past  and considers him to be credible will this stop you  conservatives  from sharing your ridiculous claims that this is  fake news  and a  political witch hunt  as donald trump put it  of course not   but you re going to look even more stupid when you do featured image via getty images alex wong
