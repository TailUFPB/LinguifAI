republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for obamacare but they failed miserably  after taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on wednesday  donald trump looked at the cameras and said   we have essentially repealed obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better  obamacare has been repealed in this bill   he added  well  like most things trump says  that s just not true  but  if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former president obama s signature legislation  he would have and without offering an alternative senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told npr that  this has not been a very bipartisan year  i hope in the new year  we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative  an obamacare repeal in  is doa  well  we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a   senate   the kentucky republican said   we ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a   senate  but i think we ll probably move on to other issues  npr reports mcconnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of   a promise he made to moderate republican sen  susan collins of maine to get her support for the tax bill on top of that mcconnell broke with house speaker paul ryan  r wis   on the approach to paring back spending on programs like medicaid and food stamps  mcconnell told npr he is  not interested  in using senate budget rules to allow republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with democrats  i think entitlement changes  to be sustained  almost always have to be bipartisan   mcconnell said   the house may have a different agenda  if our democratic friends in the senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform  i d be happy to take a look at it  this is coming from mitch mcconnell  he knows donald trump is destroying the gop  it doesn t matter  sen  mcconnell  we still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president obama s a one term president  well  we re hoping that trump doesn t last a full term  funny how that works photo by chip somodevilla getty images
