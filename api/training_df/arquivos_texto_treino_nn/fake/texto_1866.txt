we already knew that russia wanted donald trump to be president and interfered with the election  but new information has just been revealed showing that not only was the central intelligence agency  cia  aware of this  but they were in the know as early as august of   that s well before anything was revealed to the public according to the new york times  the c i a  told senior lawmakers in classified briefings last summer that it had information indicating that russia was working to help elect donald j  trump president  a finding that did not emerge publicly until after mr  trump s victory months later  former government officials say  further  the former officials said that in late august    weeks before the election   john o  brennan  then the c i a  director  was so concerned about increasing evidence of russia s election meddling that he began a series of urgent  individual briefings for eight top members of congress  some of them on secure phone lines while they were on their summer break it is unclear what new intelligence might have prompted the classified briefings  but with concerns growing both internally and publicly at the time about a significant russian breach of the democratic national committee  the c i a  began seeing signs of possible connections to the trump campaign  the officials said  by the final weeks of the campaign  congress and the intelligence agencies were racing to understand the scope of the russia threat  then there s this  the officials said mr  brennan also indicated that unnamed advisers to mr  trump might be working with the russians to interfere in the election  so  not only did russia work to get trump elected  but those closely connected to trump may have been working directly with russia here s the thing   if this information was available before the election  and it was well known that not only was russia trying to influence the election  but trump advisers may have been talking directly to russia  why was the election allowed to even go forward  for all intents and purposes  the election should be considered absolutely illegitimate and a new election should be held in light of all this new information our democracy and the core of everything we are as a republic has been compromised by a foreign adversary  and nothing has been done  this is not okay the public had a right to know this information going into the voting booth  and nothing was said  this is beyond maddening  and someone needs to be held responsible featured photo by mark wilson getty images
