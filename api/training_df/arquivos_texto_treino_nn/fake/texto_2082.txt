congress is chest deep in their leak investigations  with fbi director james comey in the hot seat today  during the house intelligence committee hearing  chairman devin nunes thought he d try and ask some really hard hitting questions  maybe in an attempt to trap comey into saying something that will incriminate everyone who isn t republican in the increasingly tangled web that is the russia scandal all he did was prove that this is about republicans desperately puffing up their party instead of actually getting to the bottom of possible treason  and he did it with just one question  if this committee or anyone else for that matter  someone from the public  comes with information to you about the hillary clinton campaign  or their associates  or someone from the clinton foundation  will you add that to your investigation  really  he s trying to make this about hillary  despite consensus that russia acted in the interest of trump  it certainly sounded like that s what nunes was doing when he followed up with  if they have ties to russian intelligence services  russian agents  would that be something of interest to you  comey would not fall into nunes  trap  though  he replied with  if people bring us information about what they think is improper  unlawful activity of any kind  we will evaluate it  not just in this context  folks send us stuff all the time  they should keep doing that  nunes may well by trying to follow trump s lead on this  as trump regularly throws twitter tantrums in childish attempts to deflect blame  trump is livid   comey s statements that the fbi is  indeed  investigating the russian scandal are infuriating to him  as such  he s still all over twitter trying to convince us that the real problem is the leaks  and that hillary s a traitor and a crook and we supposedly all know it  rather than all the evidence piling up against him what about all of the contact with the clinton campaign and the russians  also  is it true that the dnc would not let the fbi in to look   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    it a coincidence that nunes would also ask about hillary  likely not  nunes and the rest of the gop should give us a call when they re ready to actually go to work featured image via mark wilson getty images
