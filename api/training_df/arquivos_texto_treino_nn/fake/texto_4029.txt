if trump supporters seriously want black people to vote for the republican nominee  they should leave their nooses at home because during a rally in north carolina on wednesday evening in which donald trump made another desperate appeal to black voters  one trump supporter draped a rope around the neck of a hillary clinton doll and hung her in effigy above the crowd for all to see ginger glover is a toy store owner  so getting her hands on a  lyin  hillary  doll was easy  but it was a terrible idea to promote lynching imagery in a state where black people suffered lynchings in the past glover claims that she was only trying to say that hillary should be  incarcerated at the very least  and that hanging her in effigy was  just for effect  here s the video via youtube from  to   approximately  african americans were lynched in the state of north carolina hanging a political candidate in effigy is an act of violence or threatened violence that has no place in our elections this incident is even scarier considering that many trump supporters are openly threatening to assassinate hillary clinton or lead a violent overthrow of the federal government if trump loses the election  threats that only get worse as trump continues to claim that the election is rigged against him nevertheless  it s going to be damn near impossible for donald trump to attract black voters to his campaign  especially if his supporters are bringing nooses to rallies and threatening to hang hillary african americans are not going to appreciate that imagery and they will not vote for man who condones it featured image  screenshot
