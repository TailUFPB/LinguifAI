this week s chaotic news cycle was mostly dominated by donald trump s disgraceful response to the violence perpetuated by white supremacists  neo nazis  and other far right hate groups in charlottesville  virginia  however  that news cycle had a great big exclamation point at the end of it on friday  when it was announced that trump s white supremacist chief strategist  stephen k  bannon would be ousted  of course  bannon quickly returned to his perch at breitbart news  and promised war  now  we are seeing just what he meant everyone remembers the insane interview in which bannon promised to continue pushing his twisted ideology from outside the white house  he told the weekly standard  a conservative publication that has long been critical of trump  in part  i feel jacked up  now i m free  i ve got my hands back on my weapons  someone said   it s bannon the barbarian   i am definitely going to crush the opposition  there s no doubt  i built a f   ing machine at breitbart  and now i m about to go back  knowing what i know  and we re about to rev that machine up  and rev it up we will do  now  aside from the insanity of that remark  it seems that bannon is just as much of a dangerous lunatic as we all knew him to be  his only loyalties lie with his white supremacist agenda  therefore  it should come as no surprise that he has already begun attacking trump s national security adviser  h r  mcmaster in the pages of breitbart  this weekend  the right wing rag ran a story that featured the following headline  h r  mcmaster endorsed book that advocates quran kissing apology ceremonies  the attack charges that mcmaster refuses to adequately condemn islam  which is something of a requirement in pro trump circles  where do they get this evidence  well  because mcmaster allegedly supported a military manual that said not to offend muslims by desecrating their holy book  the qu ran  of course  the radical right only thinks that christians deserve any respect whatsoever this is likely just a jumping off point for breitbart s attacks on mcmaster now that bannon is out of the white house  they will likely go after general kelly as well  after all  it was known that neither of the generals was fond of bannon and the combative and chaotic nature of his white house tenure  despite the messages coming out of the white house  it is widely believed that general kelly is the one who actually was able to get trump to get rid of him all in all  bannon s return to breitbart will likely mean heightened chaos in the white house  and therefore in the nation featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
