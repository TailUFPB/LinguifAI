the co chair of trump s voter fraud commission  set up to prove that hillary clinton didn t win the popular vote because of the  millions  of illegal votes he says were cast for his opponent  just inserted both feet in his mouth  grew a new foot  then shoved that one in the other available orifice on wednesday when he admitted that trump may not be our legitimate president  you know  we may never know the answer to that   kansas secretary of state kris kobach told msnbc s katy tur when asked whether he thought clinton won the popular vote by  to  million votes  we will probably never know the answer to that question   he said  in reality  clinton only won by   million votes   but kobach is a moron  how do you say we may never know the answer to that question   tur asked  then things got really stupid  what i m saying is  let s suppose that the commission determined that there were a certain number of votes cast by ineligible voters  you still won t know whether those people who were ineligible voted for trump or for clinton or for somebody else and so  it s impossible to ever know exactly  if you took out all the ineligible votes  what the final tally would be in that election  you can obviously  based on the data  you can make some very educated guesses  so are the votes for donald trump that led him to win the election in doubt as well   tur pressed  absolutely   replied kobach voter fraud   especially in person   is extremely rare  though a couple of trump supporters have been caught illegally voting multiple times after he told them people would illegally vote for hillary clinton in other words  the system works and people who try to vote illegally do get caught  the integrity of the voting systems themselves  however  could be questioned as russian agents provably hacked our electoral system in  states is donald trump the legitimate president  the answer is that  he s an idiot  until we know the full extent of russian attacks on our election watch the interview below
