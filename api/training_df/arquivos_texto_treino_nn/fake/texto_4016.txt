when fox news goon jesse watters went to chinatown in new york to put together an incredibly racist segment filled with asian stereotypes  it caused national outrage now watters is getting a taste of his own medicine thanks to comedian jason selvig during watter s racist report  he talked to residents who didn t speak much english  asked them if they know karate and if they can  take care of north korea for us  fox news  bill o reilly  and watters disrespected and insulted the asian american community that day  and they have still not issued an apology despite asian american organizations raining hell on them with statement after statement condemning the segment so selvig treated watters the same way selvig approached watters on the street and gave him a hug before saying  hello  to him using a racist asian accent  pretty good  right   selvig asked watters   it s racist like you like  a confused watters then realizes what s going on and tries to run away like a coward  but selvig continues mocking him by pitching future segments watters should consider for his next  man on the streets  bit  just a bunch of black people eating fried chicken   selvig suggests   how about just mexicans eating tacos  selvig then suggests a segment on gay people  but then remembers that watters already did that and shows some footage of it  oh just like  call all muslims terrorists   selvig continues before nixing the idea because  i guess you guys already do  selvig tells watters that he ll leave him alone if he plugs his movie  undecided   when watters avoids doing so  selvig takes matters into his own hands and declares that it s endorsed by fox news here s the video via facebook jesse watters and fox news should think twice before doing such a segment ever again  in fact  they should just not do these kinds of segments at all  but if they do  perhaps comedians from all over can approach watters on the streets and mock him  it s called karma  and watters just got a taste of it featured image  screenshot
