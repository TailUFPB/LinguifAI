the black lives matter movement has become a convenient scapegoat for many on the right  who compare the growing social justice movement that is trying to raise awareness about the problem of police violence towards blacks the newest and possibly strangest instance of this blame game comes from atlanta  where attorney claud  tex  mciver blames the shooting death of his wife diane on the movement mciver was riding in the back seat of his car when his   revolver went off  wounding his wife who was seated up front  she died in surgery several hours later this is his explanation for what happened mciver says he and his wife were being driven home by diane s best friend when their ford explorer was approached by several individuals during a week in which there were many black lives matter protests in the area  according to bill crane  a mciver family friend  who spoke to the the atlanta journal constitution on friday fearing they were about to be carjacked  mciver pulled out his gun from the center console as a precaution  mciver was falling asleep with the gun in his lap and has no recollection of pulling the trigger  crane told the newspaper the accusation doesn t really meet the smell test  at the very least the mciver case sounds like so many of the accidental gun deaths that come about from far too many guns floating around the country  especially in states like georgia in the south but it s also possible that something more sinister occurred and black lives matter   a movement that has not endorsed violence and is in fact trying to curtail it   is being used as part of a blame game that we ve heard before  violent crimes have in the past often been blamed on a convenient black figurehead in order to obscure what really happened so far police have listed the death as a  homicide  featured image via youtube
