this election is all about the supreme court  and nobody s been hammering that point more than republicans  they say that if hillary s elected  she ll nominate liberal judges who will take away all our rights and freedoms  or something  because that s totally how the judicial branch works  to that end  the gop has pretty much said they ll block all her nominees  just as they ve blocked merrick garland  the justice obama nominated to replace justice scalia to nobody s surprise  obama is pissed off about this  as well he should be because now they re just being childish and petty  the senate gop originally said that they won t consider garland because they think the american people should decide who replaces scalia  now they re going back on even that  and obama put a nice  sharp point on their hypocrisy earlier today  now they re saying   well  if  don t decide the way we want them to decide  maybe we won t even do that   eleven years ago  richard burr said a supreme court without nine justices would not work  well  what changed  what  only republican presidents get to nominate judges  is that in the constitution  i used to teach constitutional law  i ve never seen that provision    what  only republican presidents get to nominate judges   obama goes to town on gop senators floating a scotus blockade under clinton  pic twitter com lcsxvejukj  sahil kapur   sahilkapur  november     with their  my way or the highway   position  they ve proved once and for all that this has nothing to do with having the american people decide anything  it proves that they don t care about creating a constitutional crisis if it gets them what they want  it s about knowing that they ll lose even more power if a democratic president is allowed any more supreme court justices   the will of the people be damned and power is all they care about  at this point  they don t care how they get it and keep it as long as they do it if hillary s elected next tuesday  the american people will have decided  even if they decided against republicans rather than deciding for democrats  the nominees of democratic presidents deserve a fair hearing and vote  it s a truly terrible situation for the gop  but  well  they ve been digging their own graves for six years  they get to live with the fruits of their actions featured image by sara d  davis via getty images
