 i think that maybe i wouldn t be here if it wasn t for twitter   donald trump told fox news earlier this year   this possibility apparently has twitter co founder evan williams staying up at night  as he just apologized for any role twitter played in putting orange mussolini in the white house  it s a very bad thing  twitter s role in that   williams told the new york times in an article published saturday   if it s true that he wouldn t be president if it weren t for twitter  then yeah  i m sorry  this isn t the first time williams has expressed dismay at the impact of social media on trump s message  of hate    what we tend to forget is that zeus was so pissed at prometheus that he chained him to a rock so eagles could peck out his guts for eternity   he said in a commencement speech at the university of nebraska earlier this month   some would say that s what we deserve for giving the power of tweets to donald trump  unfortunately  trump is correct that twitter played a huge role in swinging his election his way   especially with numerous paid russian trolls on his side spreading lies about his opponent even more unfortunately  the lies and hate he continues to tweet as president  are continuing to have a deleterious impact on our nation featured image via getty images pool
