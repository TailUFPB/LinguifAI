north carolina  which is still butthurt over the supreme court s decision not to allow their voter suppression law to go into effect before the election  is getting a touch creative with their reasons not to allow early voting  what if a person votes  and then dies we wish we were making this up alas  though  we aren t  dallas woodhouse  north carolina s gop executive director  tried his best to sound extremely worried about this non existent crisis when he spoke to fox  about it  we have a situation here where you have to be alive on election day  if you vote early  you still have to be alive in a very close race you could literally have dead people voting  we have a situation here   har de har har   dead people voting  has been one of the gop s drumbeats regarding voter fraud for a long time  and  of course  on their planet  voter fraud actually only occurs when democrats are able to vote  early voting is one of those areas  but absentee voting  for some reason  isn t gee  could it be because the majority of people who cast absentee ballots in north carolina are white  elderly and republican  the majority of people who cast ballots during early voting are primarily minority and democrat  from a reasonable perspective  if north carolina were really worried about dead people voting  they should be targeting absentee voting  not early voting north carolina does have a law requiring that voters be alive on election day for their votes to be counted  even if they cast an early or absentee ballot  there are  however  contingencies in effect should someone who voted early die before election day  they re outlined by north carolina board of elections general counsel josh lawson  below  all early voting is done on retrievable ballots   he said   if a person dies  the county board of elections is notified by the social security administration or the registrar of deeds  they have a pretty good system for tracking deaths  when we become aware of it  we remove that ballot   north carolina is busy what iffing itself off the edge of the sanity cliff here  with each comment  they increasingly prove that their voter suppression law was all about suppressing the minority vote featured image by sara d  davis getty images
