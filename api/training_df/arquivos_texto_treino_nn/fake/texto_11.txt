republicans are working overtime trying to sell their scam of a tax bill to the public as something that directly targets middle class and working class families with financial relief  nothing could be further from the truth  and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly  speaking on cnbc  paul ryan was going full throttle  trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money but he didn t just go with the usual talking points  with a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know  ryan claimed that the    more per year that families living paycheck to paycheck will see is extremely significant  then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning    per year  true   or for people living in new york or california  false  those are the same two states that trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the  vote totals to claim that trump actually won the popular vote  watch ryan completely dismiss all the struggling families living in blue states below if you re living paycheck to paycheck which is more than half of the people in this country and you got   from a tax cut next year  that s not nothing  pic twitter com   paul ryan   speakerryan  december    needs to reach through their computer or television and wipe that smugness off his face  it is the height of arrogance and insult to imply that there are no struggling families in either of those two states featured image via mark wilson getty images
