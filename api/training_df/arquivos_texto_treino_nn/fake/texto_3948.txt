it was a simple question  but it was enough turn donald trump s campaign manager into a live train wreck melania trump s concerns about cyber bullying on social media have come back to bite her husband s campaign for the presidency on its ass because donald trump has been bullying people on twitter since he joined in   we must treat each other with respect and kindness  even when we disagree   she said at a pennsylvania rally on thursday less than a month after telling cnn host anderson cooper that the  negativity  on social media is  damaging for the children  well  cooper discussed melania s concerns with trump campaign manager kellyanne conway and it was awkward  to say the least  if it is not okay for kids to do this  why is it okay for adults  for donald trump   cooper asked almost instantly  conway was tied in knots  well  it is really not okay for anyone to do it with malicious intent   she said   but most of what s on twitter is not about politics or journalism  this is a whole big worldwide social media culture  landscape out there  anderson  and i think what melania trump was talking about today is a cultural fact  that s when cooper dropped the hammer  but your candidate is the guy on twitter at   a m  tweeting out this stuff   he said indeed  trump has gone on several late night tirades and has bullied and insulted anyone who disagrees with him but once again  conway couldn t handle the truth and turned into a rambling mess while trying to steer the discussion towards the alleged bullying she deals with herself  i get the f word  every night from journalists  frankly  there is one who   very washed up one   frankly  can t stop tweeting at me  curse words  my children have to see that  we have to have really broad shoulders  i get it and i m just one person  but the fact is   i appreciate the fact that as a first lady melania trump has committed herself to trying something about the negativity that naturally tends to what he identified as the positive tool  social media and communication can be a force for positivity  cooper intervened and pointed out that if melania is so concerned about cyber bullying she should start at her own dinner table conway claimed that trump is only  defending himself   and cooper countered by noting that trump once viciously mocked carly fiorina s face  look at that face   trump said during an interview in september   would anyone vote for that  can you imagine that  the face of our next president   conway responded by accusing the media of  cherry picking  and basically said the media should ignore trump s insults and bullying and focus more on his other twitter posts for melania s sake  we re always cherry picking when it comes to donald trump   she said   go look at the entire twitter feed  look at his message  it is full of a lot of things  but again  i think we re doing a disservice to the platform of melania trump  here s the video via youtube seriously  how does kellyanne conway sleep at night after having to defend trump all day featured image  screenshot
