donald trump likely caused a diplomatic crisis with china when he decided he would talk to the president of taiwan on friday  the move left political observers scratching their heads and wondering how he could have possibly thought this was a good idea  the answer is simple  it s the same reason trump does everything   he thinks he can get something out of it  in this case  another luxury resort in   the united states severed all diplomatic ties with taiwan and adopted a one china stance  since that time  no president  or president elect  has spoken with the country s president  as far as china is concerned  taiwan is part of china  trump s phone call with tsai ying wen  the president of taiwan   is likely to infuriate beijing which regards the island as a renegade province  so why on earth would trump do something like this  go figure  the trump organization just happens to be looking at taiwan as a location for their next luxury resort the shangiist  a publication that covers news in china  reported the following in november the mayor of taoyuan confirmed rumors on wednesday that us president elect donald trump was considering constructing a series of luxury hotels and resorts in the northwest taiwanese city a representative from the trump organization paid a visit to taoyuan in september  expressing interest in the city s aerotropolis  a large scale urban development project aimed at capitalizing on taoyuan s status as a transport hub for east asia  taiwan news reports  with the review process for the aerotropolis still underway  taoyuan s mayor referred to the subject of the meeting as mere investment speculation  other reports indicate that eric trump  the president elect s second son and executive vice president of the trump organization  will be coming to taoyuan later this year to discuss the potential business opportunity the dire consequences that could come from this simple phone conversation cannot be understated  the only thing less surprising than trump s stupidity is his willingness to sacrifice the united states for his own selfish gains  his businesses and foreign financial ties have come under scrutiny for the conflicts of interest they create now that trump is going to be president  he hasn t even been sworn in yet and already he is saying to hell with america for the sake of his own bank account  this is exactly why this man should not be the leader of the free world featured image via ty wright getty images
