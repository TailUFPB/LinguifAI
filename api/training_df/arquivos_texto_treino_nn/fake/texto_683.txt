donald trump finally signed the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act on wednesday   this bill strengthens and expands sanctions on russia  iran  and north korea  the legislation also blocks trump from easing those sanctions for his good buddy vladimir putin some questioned if trump would try to use his veto power even though the bill had passed both the house and senate with overwhelming support  such an effort would have been futile  as there was clearly enough support to override the veto  but still  it was a possibility since nothing is ever off the table with this administration  and as time drug on  the bill landed on trump s desk friday morning   we all began to wonder if trump was actually going to sign it when he finally did  senator john mccain had a brutal response that was absolutely perfect  he started by explaining what this legislation would accomplish  i welcome president trump s decision to sign legislation imposing new sanctions on russia  iran  and north korea  the enactment of this legislation  which enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses of congress  sends a strong message to friend and foe alike that the united states will hold nations accountable for aggressive and destabilizing behavior that threatens our national interests and those of our allies and partners   mccain wrote  the concerns expressed in the president s signing statement are hardly surprising  though misplaced  the framers of our constitution made the congress and the president coequal branches of government  this bill has already proven the wisdom of that choice  then mccain called trump out for his continued hypocritical support of russia  while the american people surely hope for better relations with russia  what this legislation truly represents is their insistence that vladimir putin and his regime must pay a real price for attacking our democracy  violating human rights  occupying crimea  and destabilizing ukraine  on this critical issue of national security policy  it was the congress that acted in the spirit of national unity to carry out the will of the american people  and that is why it is critical that the president comply with the letter and spirit of this legislation and fully implement all of its provisions  going forward  i hope the president will be as vocal about russia s aggressive behavior as he was about his concerns with this legislation  boom sorry mccain  but i wouldn t count on trump to stand up to putin any time soon  our  president  has proven time and time again that he will happily choose russia over the united states and the american people  trump s admiration for the russian dictator and his murderous rule is as obvious as it is nauseating  personally  i don t think that is likely to change  trump is in so deep with putin that he couldn t get out even if he wanted to featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
