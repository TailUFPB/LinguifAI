the trump team is caving in on itself  and donald trump s latest comments certainly won t help earlier today  trump appeared on fox   friends where he blatantly criticized white house press secretary sean spicer  addressing the mysterious and numerous leaks that have been coming out of the white house  spicer was reported to be checking the professional and personal cell phones of white house staffers in the west wing to make sure they weren t involved in leaking any information  it was a drastic move  and we ve never seen such distrust within an administration  and yet trump still claims everything in the white house is running like a  well oiled machine   but something tells us that after spicer hears what trump just said  things are going to change in his exclusive white house interview  trump admitted that he wouldn t have handled the leaks the way spicer did  steve doocey asked trump  sean spicer asked his communication team   alright come on in everybody  put your phone right over there  we have a leaker here  we re gonna have the white house lawyer look at your phones   how intent are you on finding who the leaker or leakers are in your administration  not just your communications team  but over at the state department  maybe the intel community  everywhere  trump first bragged about how great his press secretary was  even though there have been several reports that state trump is unhappy with spicer s performance and would rather replace him with a woman   he said  well first of all  sean spicer is a fine human being  he s a fine person  then trump criticized spicer  i would have done it differently  i would have gone one on one with different people  i would have handled it different than sean  but sean handles it his way  and i m ok with it  hinting that he felt spicer was going far too easy on staffers  trump joked that if it were up to him   there are things you can do that are a hell of a lot worse  you can watch trump throw his press secretary under the bus below  featured image via chip somodevilla and gary gershoff   getty images
