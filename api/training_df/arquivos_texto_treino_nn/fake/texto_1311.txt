the smithsonian s museum of african american history opened to much fanfare  and also  much hatred from white people who think that such a thing is an affront to white history and therefore  reverse discrimination  since trump was elected  hate crimes and incidents have skyrocketed  and now  some racist asshat  or more than one  has decided to take their hatred straight to that museum by hanging a noose yes  seriously  someone hung a noose up in the museum of african american history  and not just once  but twice over the last four days  the noose isn t an innocent symbol  it s a stark and painful reminder of the days when lynching was common practice  particularly against black people which is precisely the reason these people hang nooses like that  according to a spokesman for the southern poverty law center  it s been a long time since we saw hatred like this  we haven t seen such mainstream support for hate in decades  not since the civil rights era  years ago  we re witnessing a moment when there are tremendous challenges to the country that we built on pluralism and democracy  the civil rights accorded every american are firmly under threat  but people of color  women  the lgbtq community  and every other marginalized group out there is apparently a direct threat to the straight  white  christian american  and trump s election has empowered them to act like they re just taking their country back from the  scourge  of political correctness they so decried during the campaign the smithsonian issued their own statement about this  and they cut whoever it is that s responsible for the nooses  the smithsonian family stands together in condemning this act of hatred and intolerance  especially repugnant in a museum that affirms and celebrates the american values of inclusion and diversity   wrote the secretary of the smithsonian institution david skorton in an institution wide email   we will not be intimated  cowardly acts like these will not  for one moment  prevent us from the vital work we do  people who do this are trying to drag our country back to a time when they were comfortable because they could step on everybody different from them  we can t let that continue to happen featured image by astrid riecken via getty images
