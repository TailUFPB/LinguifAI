donald trump seriously thought having the hardest job on earth would be  easy   lol after  days on the job  many of which trump spent at his lavish florida resort playing golf  trump stated during an interview with reuters that he thought the presidency would be an easy job that he could just sail through trump complained about how his current job requires him to do much more work than he is accustomed to doing and waxed nostalgic about his life before taking over the white house  i loved my previous life  i had so many things going   trump said   this is more work than in my previous life  i thought it would be easier  this demonstrates just how woefully unprepared trump was to become president  and it certainly shows after all  trump s administration has been a complete failure only three months in his unconstitutional executive actions on immigration have been blocked by federal judges  his effort to repeal the affordable care act went down in flames  much to the relief of millions of americans  his environmental record is a disaster  he still denies science and is cutting funding to scientific agencies and organizations  he has alienated our allies while continuing to praise russia and putin  he is embroiled in an ever growing scandal  and he has turned america into a laughingstock around the world and that s just the tip of the iceberg as trump threatens world war iii over north korea and a government shutdown looms because he refuses to negotiate with democrats the only president who has had an arguably worse first  days is william henry harrison and that s only because he died  days into his presidency  but at least he didn t embarrass the nation and destroy it from within the fact is that being president is a tough job  it s also a lonely job  there s a reason why presidents go grey during their years in office  it s a stressful job  every decision made affects the nation and the world  maybe if trump spent less time golfing  tweeting  and watching cable news he would know that being president means working with congress  including democrats  instead  trump would rather act like a dictator and just sign executive orders between tee times and whine when he doesn t get his way clearly  trump doesn t know what hard work is featured image  tom pennington getty images
