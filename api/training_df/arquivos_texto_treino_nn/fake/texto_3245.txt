it would be a great sight to behold if a new york city police officer were ordered to place donald trump in handcuffs  people would cheer and it could happen if new york state attorney general eric schneiderman has enough evidence to charge trump with crimes related to his fraudulent  charity  the trump foundation is currently under investigation for self dealing  which means the foundation paid out donations to its own officers  which is illegal and totally unethical and immoral money that should have been used to help cure cancer has instead benefited trump personally as he has used foundation money to buy stuff for himself  pay legal fees and settlements  and pay executives involved in running the scam trump  of course  whined on twitter about the investigation  claiming that  percent of funds go to charities i gave millions of dollars to djt foundation  raised or recieved millions more  all of which is given to charity  and media won t report   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    djt foundation  unlike most foundations  never paid fees  rent  salaries or any expenses    of money goes to wonderful charities   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    trump is lying because even the trump foundation admitted to self dealing in their  tax returns to the irs trump even thought he could escape the legal system by simply shuttering the foundation  but schneiderman s office informed him that he can t  legally dissolve until that investigation is complete  and if that investigation finds that trump broke the law  he would be subject to charges and arrest  and as military veteran and blogger david axe points out  there is precedent for an nypd officer to arrest trump and haul his ass to jail  president elect donald trump could be in big legal trouble over his allegedly self dealing charity   axe began   it s entirely possible that he could eventually face arrest  and it wouldn t be unprecedented if  say  a new york cop actually slapped cuffs on trump and read him his rights  after all  a ballsy policeman arrested pres  ulysses grant way back in    albeit for a comparatively minor crime  it s not unprecedented for a small time cop to arrest america s commander in chief  in   pres  ulysses grant got busted for riding his horse at an unsafe speed at  and m streets in washington  d c  the arresting officer  william west  had previously issued grant a warning for the same offense  do you think  officer  that i was violating the speed laws   grant reportedly asked west  i certainly do  mr  president   west replied   i am very sorry  mr  president  to have to do it  for you are the nation s chief executive  but my duty is plain  sir  i shall have to place you under arrest  do your duty  my good man   grant said  west escorted the president to the police station for booking  grant paid a fine and walked free  officer and president reportedly became friends after the incident yes  this really happened  and stealing money from charities is a hell of a lot worse of a crime than speeding while riding a horse in fact  the precedent of arresting sitting presidents for breaking the law goes back even further  franklin pierce was arrested in  for running a lady over with his horse  the case was dropped due to lack of evidence but the points stands  police officers can arrest the president for violating the law and it sure looks like trump violated it repeatedly as axe points out  however  trump probably won t go quietly  if a new york cop arrests trump  it seems unlikely that the notoriously temperamental trump   and his equally angry private security detail   will react as gentlemanly as grant did to his own arrest   he concluded frankly  trump should be thrown in a prison cell next to ponzi schemer bernie madoff  because while madoff only scammed rich people  trump stole money from kids with cancer to pay his employees and his legal bills  that s truly deplorable featured image via capitol hill blue
