canadian prime minister justin trudeau is a diplomatic  nice guy   unlike his american counterpart  donald trump  while speaking on the issue of how to deal with trump  trudeau was able to show class and grace  while still throwing major shade at the bombastic  bumbling american president  trudeau s low key handling of trump could cost him with his progressive base at home  but given trump s penchant for retaliation  going after trump explicitly could be harmful to canada s economy  given the fact that they export so many products to our country while speaking on trump  trudeau said  why poke a grizzly bear while it s having lunch  trump has just got into office and he is formulating his economic plans  this is clearly a departure from the closeness trudeau had with president obama  their adorable bromance and open and affectionate friendship is surely something that will not be duplicated with trump  those familiar with the situation on how trudeau may handle trump acknowledge that no one quite knows what to do with him at this point  one source said  he is totally unpredictable  of course  this isn t the first time trudeau has thrown passive aggressive public punches at trump  after trump s muslim ban threw the nation and world into chaos  trudeau tweeted to those fleeing persecution  terror   war  canadians will welcome you  regardless of your faith  diversity is our strength  welcometocanada  justin trudeau   justintrudeau  january    course  trudeau s reluctance to go after trump may not last long  he is up for re election in   and will have to continue to tout his commitment to diversity and inclusion in the fact of trump s crude nationalism and open bigotry  however  canadian pollster nik nanos says trudeau is doing the right thing regarding trump for now  he has to avoid making any kind of criticism  trump has a very thin skin and he s quick to lash out  that may be  but given trudeau s public statements regarding diversity and progressive values  he is not likely to hold off for long before he takes the gloves off regarding trump  we ll be lucky if america has any friends left by the end of trump s term featured image via drew angerer getty images
