police violence against people of color is a huge problem in america  the worst part of it is that these people almost never even make it to trial  much less get convicted  it s a horrific pattern of abuse and state sanctioned murder that seems to have no end in sight  well  tragically  under donald trump and his new racist attorney general jeff sessions  things are about to get a whole hell of a lot worse as soon as sessions was sworn in  he stood with trump as they announced three new executive orders giving cops even more power to murder with impunity and without consequence  citing the  threat of rising crime  and  public safety  as his justifications  trump just signed the death warrants of many more people of color at the hands of police  trump says of the orders  i am directing the department of justice to reduce crimes and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers  it s a shame  what has been happening to our great  our truly great  law enforcement officers  that is going to stop today  trump went on to basically threaten people with the orders  saying he was sending a  clear sign  to anyone who might put a toe out of line  he said to the would be criminals  your day is over  a new era of justice begins and it begins right now  one of the documents is said to define new federal crimes  and increase penalties for existing federal crimes  in order to prevent violence  when it comes to cops getting shot  of course  they had nothing to say regarding the scores of people who are killed by cops with no justification whatsoever  to compare   saw  cops killed  while  people were killed by cops  so  yeah  the real problem here is violence  sure  but it s not against the police trump and sessions know good and damn well who they are targeting here  it s not people who look like them or their kids  it s people of color who are often stopped by police for no good reason whatsoever let s face it   this will lead to more murder by cop and mass incarceration of people of color  which is  of course  exactly what racists like donald trump and jeff sessions want featured image via win mcnamee getty images
