it didn t take long for conservative  christians  to jump to the defense of roy moore not long after the washington post published a story containing detailed accusations from several women who claim that moore sexually assaulted and abused them as teens  conservatives disgustingly continued to back him despite having the opposite reaction to allegations against several high profile hollywood actors and producers and that s not to mention the reaction conservatives had when right wing websites pushed a conspiracy claiming that hillary clinton ran a sex trafficking operation inside a pizza restaurant  a conspiracy that was immediately and thoroughly debunked conservatives still believe that conspiracy  but refuse to believe the very real victims who have come forward about moore rather than call for moore to step aside  conservative  christians  are more rabid than ever  and that includes jerry falwell jr   who along with the rest of his anti gay friends still supports moore just like they continued to support donald trump despite trump saying on tape that he likes to grab women by their genitals without their consent  it comes down to a question who is more credible in the eyes of the voters   the candidate or the accuser   falwell said   the same thing happened to president trump a few weeks before his election last year except it was several women making allegations  he denied that any of them were true and the american people believed him and elected him the  president of the united states  and i believe the judge is telling the truth  so falwell jr  is making moore s guilt contingent on whether voters elect him or not  in other words  he s telling republican voters that electing him is the equivalent of a jury verdict of  not guilty  but that s not how the justice system works  and it s not how we should be judging political candidates it should be pointed out that the race in alabama has turned into a dead heat according to a poll taken after the bombshell story dropped  so clearly voters must not think moore is very credible these are credible allegations that should be taken seriously  seriously enough that moore should be forced to withdraw his candidacy  the fact that conservatives are using the bible to defend sexual abuse and assault proves that they are nothing more than fake christians  they would support a pedophile rather than vote for a democrat  that s how far conservative  christians  have fallen  they are literally supporting a man who claimed that homosexuality causes pedophilia  the same man who is being accused of predatory sexual behavior involving a  year old girl  only moore is a straight white  christian  so conservatives think his pedophilia is acceptable hillary clinton was right  these people are deplorable featured image  scott olson getty images
