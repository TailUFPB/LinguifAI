michele bachmann is a special snowflake  if there is anyone who is crazier than sarah palin and donald trump  it is definitely her  last week we learned that the former congresswoman is one of the people advising trump on foreign policy because she knows soooo much about foreigners and stuff  she s an expert  she can see isis from her house  in minnesota now this week we are learning the real reason good ol  michele thinks the billionaire was chosen as the gop nominee  during an interview on the christian broadcasting network s show the brody file she said  i actually supported ted cruz  i thought he was fabulous but i also see that at the end of the day god raised up  i believe  donald trump who was going to be the nominee in this election  i don t think god sits things out  he s a sovereign god  donald trump became our nominee i think it s very likely that in the day that we live in  that donald trump is the only individual who could win in a general election of the  who ran  maybe i m wrong  i don t know but i do know that the bible is true and that daniel teaches the most high god  which is one of god s names  is the one who lifts up who he will and takes down who he will  obviously  the real reason trump is trumping all over the place is because he is the chosen one  why didn t we think of that  hmmmmm  maybe because it is a batshit crazy way of thinking  yep  that s it as wonkette  if you don t know who wonkette is we highly recommend you check them out  points out  it is incredibly unlikely that bachmann believes obama is president because god   raised up  and had him elected  after all  the gop seems to believe that god  only works for them michele clearly doesn t want to admit that the only reason trump is the nominee is because he was the most racist of all of the candidates and the gop base loves racists  they wanted a candidate who represented their beliefs that  the blacks  should still be drinking out of different water fountains and  the hispanics  should pick vegetables and shut up  it had nothing to do with god  and everything to do with the disgusting rhetoric that his infected the minds of republican voters featured image via t j  kirkpatrick getty images
