if donald trump and his team were planning to continue using the ole  i forgot  defense to explain all these secret meetings with russian officials during the campaign  he should think again because during an appearance on the today show with chuck todd  republican strategist nicolle wallace blew that defense out of the water by pointing out that while one trump official could reasonably say they forgot about a meeting  it s really hard to believe that all of them could have simply forgotten that they met with russian officials the number of trump officials who met or spoke to russian officials during the campaign has only risen in recent weeks as it has been revealed that jeff sessions and jared kushner both communicated with them during the election in addition to michael flynn  who lied about his own contact with russian officials and had to resign for it  it s inexplicable now why so many people had so many meetings with so many russians that they forgot about   wallace said wallace went on to call for a   style commission to investigate trump s russia scandal and when todd asked if trump and his team could offer one big excuse to explain their actions  she made it clear that trump is cornered  there is none  so many people having so many contacts and not remembering  it doesn t make sense  they re either the most forgetful team in political history or the most intimate with russia  and neither one of those labels is good for trump and his administration here s the video jeff sessions did not forget his meeting with russian officials during the campaign  he simply lied under oath about it and is making an excuse to avoid being charged with committing perjury donald trump s russia scandal only continues to get worse and his desperate attempts to distract the american public no longer work  it s time for congress to take this scandal seriously and investigate it  but republicans should not investigate it themselves  it s clear they are too biased to do it  so they must appoint an independent commission and a special prosecutor  it s the only way to make sure this gets done and gets done right featured image via youtube
