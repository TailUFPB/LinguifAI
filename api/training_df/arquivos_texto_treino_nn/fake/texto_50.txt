jared kushner  senior white house adviser and son in law of president donald trump  was interviewed by special counsel robert mueller s office at the beginning of november  according to a source familiar with the process  as part of an interview that lasted approximately  minutes  kushner was quizzed mainly on his interactions  meetings  and any general contact he had with former national security adviser michael flynn  as well as his son  in regards to flynn s private business dealings with his firm  flynn intel group  mr  kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so   kushner s attorney  abbe lowell  said in a statement given to nbc news the news of kushner s interview first came to light when grand jury testimony related to flynn s private business dealings was postponed by prosecutors working for mueller  the reason for which is still unclear  this postponement came just a week after flynn s attorneys alerted president trump s legal team that information related to the case could no longer be shared between the two parties  nor are they allowed to publicly comment on the matter  it is not uncommon for defense teams to share information  but the practice is considered unethical once a conflict of interest arises  not that donald trump has ever been particularly concerned with matters as trivial as  ethics  the fact that flynn s attorneys are no longer sharing information with trump s legal team is in no way proof that flynn is cooperating with the special counsel  but it is a decent sign that he is working with them  but trump s team has been expecting this for quite some time  it is probably a plea deal   jay sekulow  a member of president trump s legal team  told cbs news earlier in the month   that is the assumption  and if it is a plea that doesn t necessarily mean it has anything to do with the president  the manafort indictment didn t have anything to do with the campaign or trump  michael flynn served as the head of the defense intelligence agency until he was fired from the position in  by former president barack obama  however  he still retained a security clearance  even during trump s presidential campaign and transition into the white house until flynn s role was terminated  days into trump s presidency  any possible cooperation flynn has with the prosecution could give mueller s counsel insight into the trump campaign s operations and potential dealings with russia  as well as the first few weeks of his presidency the fbi is already looking into both flynn s trump lobbying and flynn intel group s research work for an unfinished film for which the firm was paid    by a turkish businessman  employees of sphere consulting  who did public relations work on the film  have been turning over documents requested by mueller s investigators and sitting for voluntary interviews for several months featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
