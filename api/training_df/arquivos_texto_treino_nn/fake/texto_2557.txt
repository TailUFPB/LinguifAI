trump keeps saying that  bad people   a k a radical islamic terrorist groups  are happy that he s been unable to keep immigrants  refugees and travelers from seven middle eastern countries from coming into the u s  but that s not what makes them happy  what makes them happy is actually that trump is in the white house  he s a bumbling idiot who s going to piss off so many muslims that these groups feel they won t have any trouble recruiting and growing  and throwing off the shackles of the  oppressive west  al qaeda s leader in yemen has already expressed his sheer joy at trump s bungled raid there  hezbollah has joined the fray  too  saying something that should be offensive as all hell to trump  we are very optimistic that when an idiot settles in the white house and boasts about his idiocy  this is the beginning of relief for the oppressed around the world  one of the reasons they feel optimistic is likely the fact that trump is busy pissing off the entire world  which will galvanize various groups into working together assuming enough of the world gets angry there are squillions of theories out about why these groups hate us so much  such as the anti muslim propaganda that s been circulating here with growing frequency over the last  years  many people the world over view that kind of propaganda as coming from our government  and now  with trump  that view has been vindicated trump is a master of anti brown people propaganda to the point where terrorist groups like al qaeda and isis have used him in recruiting videos  he s said  islam hates us   and claimed we would  wipe out islamic terrorist groups   four islamic non profit organizations have rejected federal funding intended to help them fight radicalization because of trump  they feel that both the funds and trump himself merely promote hatred  fear and intolerance  and that he s declared war on muslims there s much more  too  trump is pigeonholing muslims as a naturally violent group that must be exterminated  it alienates muslims of every stripe  so really  is it any wonder that hezbollah or anyone else is happy that trump was elected  he s helping their cause  trump is making things more dangerous for us  he will never do anything that will make us safer featured image by chris kleponis via getty images
