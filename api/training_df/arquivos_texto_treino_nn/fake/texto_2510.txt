if federal authorities discover what they are reportedly looking for  the republican propaganda network could be in deep sh t last year  roger ailes was ousted as fox news boss because gretchen carlson and other female anchors filed sexual harassment lawsuits according to carlson s lawsuit  ailes punished her after she refused to have sex with him  he constantly ogled her and told her to wear short skirts to emphasize her legs  he also allowed misogyny to run rampant  carlson even named current fox   friends host steve doocy in the lawsuit first  ailes demoted carlson by removing her from fox   friends  and then he fired her after she continued to refuse to sleep with him to further her career the case against ailes was so damning that even megyn kelly defended carlson eventually  ailes settled the lawsuit and fox news paid carlson   million  ailes was then fired by the company and given a   million severance package and that money is the source of a possible investigation that federal authorities are considering or already moving forward with andrea tantaros  lawyer judd burstein  who is representing her in her sexual harassment lawsuit against fox news and roger ailes  recently received a subpoena from federal prosecutors  and he told the hollywood reporter what it means  once i saw it  i knew what was happening   burstein said   they were investigating whether fox news violated securities laws by not reporting settlements to the securities and exchange commission  in other words  fox news may have settled the lawsuit against ailes without informing the shareholders of the decision to pay carlson   million while also agreeing to pay ailes   million  their haste to quickly sweep the lawsuit out of national headlines would be a violation of rules set up by the securities and exchange commission in a statement following the report  fox news claimed the corporation has not received a subpoena  but did say they have been in contact with u s  attorneys  the court granted fox news  motion to send andrea tantaros  case to arbitration  where it always belonged  and rejected her counsel judd burstein s histrionics  apparently one of mr  burstein s other clients has received a subpoena  neither fox news nor  has received a subpoena  but we have been in communication with the u s  attorney s office for months  we have and will continue to cooperate on all inquiries with any interested authorities  if fox news gets busted for not informing their shareholders they could end up paying a hefty fine to settle with the sec  that just takes more money out of rupert murdoch s pockets and could make it more difficult for the company to make huge offers to fox hosts and anchors to stick around when it s time to renew contracts  it would be a major financial setback for the conservative propaganda machine hopefully  federal authorities are able to launch or continue their investigation without interference from donald trump featured image via dangerous minds
