even donald trump s staunchest allies in the republican party are turning on him rick santorum has spent a lot of time kissing trump s ass and as a conservative extremist he holds a lot of sway with trump supporters  especially the so called  christian  ones but after republicans suffered humiliating electoral defeats on tuesday in new and virginia  santorum had words for trump upon hearing of ed gillespie s loss in virginia  trump blamed him for the defeat and threw him under the bus ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for  don t forget  republicans won  out of  house seats  and with the economy doing record numbers  we will continue to win  even bigger than before   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    s not forget that trump strenuously voiced his support of gillespie for weeks  including on tuesday as voters went to the polls but voters elected democrats instead  a clear rejection of trump that could be a sign of things to come in  and  the fact is that gillespie did embrace trump during the campaign  and that was what doomed him rick santorum came to gillespie s defense in response to trump s tweet  it s not ed s fault  santorum began   you re blaming it on ed  and i just don t think it s ed s fault  i think the bottom line is donald trump is not delivering on what he said he was going to deliver on  and that s the problem  and he needs to deliver  and if there s a message for republicans they better get that message and they better start passing stuff and looking like they can govern  here s the video via youtube donald trump has never taken responsibility for anything in his entire life  he ll take credit for anything that goes right even if he had nothing to do with the success and he ll blame others for anything that goes wrong even if he is partly or wholly responsible that s the person republicans chose to lead their party and they will suffer for it in elections to come  just like they did in this one featured image  screenshot
