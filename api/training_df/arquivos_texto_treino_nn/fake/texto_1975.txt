donald trump s head is going to explode when he sees this back in september as the  campaign raged on  trump claimed that undocumented immigrants cost the united states hundreds of billions of dollars and complained that only  percent to  percent of them pay taxes  illegal immigration  each year  costs us between   billion and   billion   trump told cnn host erin burnett   i don t know if anybody gives you those numbers  probably not  there s very little  percentage wise   trump said on the number of immigrants who pay taxes   there s very little  probably  percent   percent  wrong as it turns out  trump claimed in august that the figure was around   billion  but politifact rated his claim  false  after doing some research  trump s information comes from an unreliable conservative think tank that fiercely opposes immigration  reports from other organizations  even conservative ones  put the figure drastically lower it also turns out that around more than half of the undocumented immigrants in this country pay more taxes than donald trump does  after all  just a single year of trump s tax returns showed that he probably didn t pay a dime in federal income taxes for over a decade  undocumented immigrants on the other hand  have contributed   billion to social security alone as well as other federal  local and state taxes  while not being able to receive any federal  state  or local benefits that may be a huge reason why trump refuses to release his tax returns  because he knows that they would expose him as the hypocrite  liar  and tax cheat that he is now one undocumented immigrant is bravely daring trump to release his taxes after she proved his claims wrong with a single photograph belen sisa is a resident of arizona who was brought to america by her undocumented immigrant parents when she was six years old  sisa decided to send a message to donald trump and all of those anti immigrant conservatives who believe the myths about undocumented immigrants that right wing groups constantly spew so she posted a picture of herself proudly holding up her tax returns on facebook and included the following message i  an undocumented immigrant  just filed my taxes and paid   to the state of arizona  i cannot receive financial aid from the state or federal government for school  i cannot benefit from unemployment  a reduced healthcare plan  or a retirement fund  i think i m a pretty good citizen  oh and there are millions just like me who pay into a system they will never receive anything from  wanna tell me again how i should be deported  contribute nothing and only leech off this country while the   wealthiest people in this country steal from you everyday  how about you show me yours donald j  trump   heretostay your move  donald featured image  andrew harrer pool getty images
