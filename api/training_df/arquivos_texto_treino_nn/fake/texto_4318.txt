hurricane matthew is helping republicans suppress voters who could help democrats win florida in november and fox news is gleeful about it during a broadcast on fox business  host stuart varney and guest tucker carlson bragged about how florida governor rick scott refuses to extend the voter registration deadline past october  even though a massive hurricane is forcing mass evacuations from the coastal areas  i expect president obama to go down there  probably hillary clinton will go down  and probably donald trump   varney began  so there s going to be the aftermath politics  who s going to win this one  carlson responded by basically calling democratic voters lazy and seemed to relish the idea that weather hurts democratic voters  the conventional view  and i think it s right  is that anything that makes voting more difficult hurts the democrats because their voters tend to be less committed   and there may be other factors there too  but that is definitely what political consultants believe  if it rains  there s bad weather  if anything gets in the way of easy voting  democrats suffer  varney mentioned that governor scott  a trump supporter  has refused clinton s request to extend the deadline  i guess that would tend to favor the republican party in november   he quipped  it favors people who are organized  who know what they re voting for  who have their lives together   carlson responded   i mean  i guess you could say that favors the republicans  varney himself admitted that gloating about the good fortune of republicans when a hurricane is pounding the state and causing a lot of damage to people s homes is  almost crass   but that didn t deter either host one bit  what i m getting at here is you ve got this massive storm  it s arrived  it has hit florida  florida is a key state the politicians are going to be all over it  my initial reaction is to say that it favors the republicans  i hate to be   i think that sounds almost crass to be making political judgments when the storm is still hitting but nonetheless  i think that s where its going  here s the video via media matters hillary clinton and donald trump are locked in a battle for the presidency and florida is a state that has had historical importance on election day  especially when the election is close and since democrats lead the gop in registered voters and have added tens of thousands of new voters to the rolls  especially hispanics  it s clear that republicans are using hurricane matthew as an excuse to stifle democratic gains florida governor rick scott should extend the deadline but he is only interested in doing things that helps republicans  even if that means screwing over thousands of florida residents featured image  screenshot
