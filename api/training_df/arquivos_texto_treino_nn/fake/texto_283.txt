again  these are american citizens he is talking about if donald trump had treated texas and florida the way he is treating puerto rico right now  there would be riots in the streets and massive protests in front of the white house but apparently  people don t seem to understand that the people of puerto rico are american citizens who should be given the same respect and treatment that texans and floridians received after hurricanes slammed their states trump has not done that so far  not only was he too slow in responding because he focused more on trying to force nfl players to stand during the national anthem  he has not sent nearly enough troops or equipment or supplies to puerto rico  and he is insulting them to add insult to injury trump has taken to twitter to constantly brag about the recovery operation despite his response being worse than president george w  bush s response to hurricane katrina  puerto rico was devastated by two category  hurricanes  yet less water and food has been sent to the island when trump s administration tried to frame the disaster as a  good news story   san juan mayor carmen yulin cruz fired back by pointing out that people are dying  trump threw a temper tantrum in response and suggested that puerto ricans are lazy people who won t help themselves on sunday morning  trump lashed out again  while bragging about the recovery effort as if it s the best recovery effort in history  trump congratulated himself and called puerto ricans who criticize the weak effort  ingrates  we have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in puerto rico  outside of the fake news or politically motivated ingrates   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by fema and our great military  all buildings now inspected     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    for safety  thank you to the governor of p r  and to all of those who are working so closely with our first responders  fantastic job   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     trump s response to the crisis in puerto rico could be much better and it s certainly not as good as he thinks it has been  furthermore  trump insulted puerto ricans again  while mayor cruz is working to save lives  trump is busy golfing and rage tweeting  he is enraged because he thinks brown people should be grateful for what little help he has provided  that s a totally unacceptable way to treat american citizens  period featured image  joe raedle getty images
