after all of the conspiracy theories and lies sean hannity has peddled over the years  he definitely does not deserve an award but the right wing media research center is rewarding donald trump s top propagandist with a william f  buckley jr  award for media excellence anyway  and a new york times columnist is having none of it bret stephens is a conservative columnist for the times  and he thoroughly ripped hannity in a recent column pointing out exactly why he is unworthy of the award  if we have reached the point where rank and file conservatives see nothing amiss with giving hannity an award named for buckley  then surely there s a milton friedman prize awaiting steve bannon for his insights on free trade   stephens wrote   and maybe sean spicer can receive the vaclav havel international prize for creative dissent for his role in exposing  fake news   the floor s the limit  or  in hannity s case  the crawl space beneath it  stephens went on to point out that buckley once expressed his disgust about donald trump  calling him a  demagogue  and a  narcissist   he warned americans to not fall into trump s trap  but conservatives fell for it hook  line  and sinker  hannity fell even harder for it  going so far as to lob softball questions at him and then defend him on a daily basis  hannity even committed hypocrisy by defending trump for doing all of the things he complained about president obama doing  when hannity peddles conspiracy theories about seth rich  the young democratic national committee staffer murdered in washington last year  that s an echo of john birch   stephens continued  and so we reach the idiot stage of the conservative cycle  in which a buckley award for sean hannity suggests nothing ironic  much less orwellian  to those bestowing it  applauding it  or even shrugging it off  the award itself is trivial  but it s a fresh reminder of who now holds the commanding heights of conservative life  and what it is that they think  well  that set hannity off on a twitter rage in which he whined and bragged about himself just like trump does for the first time in my life i partly agree with  bretstephensnyt i do not deserve the wfb award  i also never deserved the  marconis     sean hannity   seanhannity  july    do i deserve the radio hall of fame  free speech awards from talkers or the r r tall host of the year awards i have won  nor do i care  sean hannity   seanhannity  july    my audience that has given me the honor of  years on radio  years on fox  i thank you  you mattter  faith  family country matter  sean hannity   seanhannity  july    long as you honor me with these opportunities i will continue to fight hard for the things i truly believe in  not what wfb  media  nyt s  sean hannity   seanhannity  july    in  i m not buckley  rush  mark  or anybody else  i m myself  i will fight for limited govt  lower taxes  less regulation   sean hannity   seanhannity  july    independence  school choice  balanced budgets  secure borders  defeating isis and radical islam  and will battle a corrupt media   sean hannity   seanhannity  july    will also fight for the forgotten men and woman in america left behind  in poverty  on food stamps  and out of work  that matters to me   sean hannity   seanhannity  july     bretstephensnyt i ll say to you and the  nytimes  fake news  i do not care what u think  god bless america   sean hannity   seanhannity  july    anyone think of just one memorable thing  bretstephensnyt has written  wfb was on my show numerous times  would wfb trust the  nytimes   https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  july    that sean hannity is the face of corrupt media  he spends so much time kissing trump s ass that he might as well give him a blow job while he is down on his knees  years on fox news is  years too many  he should never have been hired and he certainly should be fired now  especially after pushing the seth rich conspiracy theory in defense of trump for as long as he did william f  buckley was an intellectual conservative  he was a graduate of yale and he served this country as a united states army officer  hannity  on the other hand  is the complete opposite  there is nothing intellectual about hannity  he s a college dropout who pretends to be a tough guy  he has made his money duping conservatives into believing his propaganda bullshit  which he peddles while offering little or zero evidence of his claims not only should hannity by booted off the air  he should not receive a media award  a fake media award would be more appropriate featured image  rob kim getty images
