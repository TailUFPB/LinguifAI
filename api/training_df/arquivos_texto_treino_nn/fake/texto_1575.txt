seth meyers takes his  a closer look  segment to destroy president donald trump and his press secretary sean spicer  meyers found more examples of stupidity on behalf of the white house  including a reference to something george w  bush said that clearly went over the president s head  bush said that the oval office is that shape to  have no corners to hide in   he also brought up a recent interview trump did with john dickerson  of cbs s face the nation  trump referred to the show as  deface the nation   while calling news outlets he doesn t like is not anything new  this was the first time he did it to the reporter s face and while taping an interview for the show in question the comedian wasn t done there  he also eviscerated the performance of the press secretary who seems to make less and less sense in his daily press briefings  despite spicer s claims  the new border fence was paid for by previous administrations  featured image via lloyd bishop nbc
