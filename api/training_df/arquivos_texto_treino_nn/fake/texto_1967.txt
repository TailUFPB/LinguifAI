trump transition team member devin nunes  who inexplicably is leading the congressional investigation into trump s ties with russia  recently got himself in a spot of trouble when he met with a source he will not reveal on the white house grounds in the middle of the night on wednesday to obtain sketchy intel that seems intended to back trump s claim that president obama  tapped  his  wires  nunes claims that he was shown u s  surveillance documents that indicate numerous members of the trump team were indirectly surveilled when they contacted some shady foreign people who were being investigated  instead of taking this information  which may or may not be true as the alleged trump investigator refuses to show his work  to his fellow investigators nunes admits he ran straight to the main subject of the investigation by thursday  nunes was scrambling to apologize for corrupting the investigation by leaking details to the guy he s supposed to be investigating amid calls for him to recuse himself  but nunes refuses to do so despite a clear conflict of interest on wednesday  cnn caught up to nunes to ask if he will recuse himself and he decided the appropriate response was that of a third grader this is the mentality of the people with whom we are dealing   they are like children who have been handed too much power and are f cking evil  but really  what did we expect given that nunes  boss regularly employs the  i know you are but what am i   and  but teacher  he hit me too  defenses watch it below instead of recusing himself from the  trumprussia investigation   devinnunes insults and denies   just like  realdonaldtrump   russiagate pic twitter com   american bridge   americanbridge  march    image via screengrab
