four years ago  many complained about the fact that mitt romney once took a vacation with his dog strapped to the top of his car  that might not have been the ultimate demise of the romney campaign  but for people who love animals  it demonstrated a cruel streak that many said made him unfit to be president donald trump doesn t have a dog story quite like that  mainly because there s no record he s ever had a dog  or for that matter  any pet  while that isn t in and of itself that unusual  trump has repeatedly shown that he too has a cruel streak when it comes to animals  and in particular  dogs keith olbermann hilariously demonstrated that in a video   why is donald trump such a weirdo about dogs  in the video  olbermann shows several tweets and comments from trump about people being  fired like a dog   or  kicked out of the abc news debate  like a dog    or  begging for money  like a dog    mitt romney  choked like a dog   according to trump  clearly  dogs don t get fired from jobs  they don t beg for money  although it s not above them to beg for treats  for olbermann  the most ridiculous  like a dog  comment to come from trump was when he accused marco rubio of  sweating like a dog   anyone who knows anything at all about dogs  knows that dogs don t sweat  they do pant  though  and that can make them very thirsty  so i suppose there is a rubio comparison to dogs  just not that one  people who don t have dogs still know about dogs   olbermann said   what the hell  is he from mars  the far  far bigger issue  though  has nothing to do with tweets or silly rhetoric  it has everything to do with how he ll do and what he ll do as president of the united states  trump  like pretty much all republicans  sees regulations as obstacles to his getting even wealthier than he is in a press release that has since been pulled off the internet  trump complained about the  fda food police   and complained that the federal government  expects farmers to produce fruits and vegetables and even dictates the nutritional content of dog food    emphasis added  as olbermann pointed out  in the last year   of the  pet food recalls from the fda have been because dog food manufacturers were poisoning dogs  that s when olbermann  visibly angry  said that trump has hinted that as a president   he would protect a business man s right to poison dogs  here s the video could you really trust a potus who has never had a dog  and  y know  wants to protect businesses who poison them  pic twitter com   keith olbermann   keitholbermann  october    of half of all americans own pets  beyond that  cruelty to animals is a major indicator of other psychological problems  including psychopathy  in other words  you don t have to be a dog owner to see that trump s attitude toward dogs sets a dangerous precedent for how he d run the country featured image of donald trump via spencer platt getty images   featured image of dog via noel vasquez getty images
