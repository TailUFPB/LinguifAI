about eight years ago  right about the time a  gasp  black man won the presidency  republicans chose to stop governing and become known only as the party of destruction obstruction during the eight years republicans were holding their collective breaths until they turned orange  they managed to block a lot of pretty common sense legislation  like infrastructure investment and protecting military personnel from losing their children while fighting gop wars  the most egregious example of gop obstructionism  though  was toward president obama s third supreme court pick  merrick garland joe biden  in a speech at the newly minted university of pennsylvania center for diplomacy and global engagement  said he spoke to a lot of the senators and several confessed to him that not giving garland the up or down vote was a mistake  but they went along with it for the worst possible reason  i call  republicans and say   you know better   biden said thursday   nine of them said to me   you re right joe  but i can t do anything about it because if i do the koch brothers or somebody is going to drop   million into my race and i ll lose my primary  source  politicobiden s solution i something that most of us can agree upon  get money out of politics  you want to change american politics tomorrow  pass public financing of elections   biden said republicans actually blamed biden for their refusal to confirm garland  they blamed the  biden rule   which supposedly said that they shouldn t confirm a lifetime appointment in an election year  republicans are wrong  biden did say that election years are contentious times to make a lifetime appointment  but he also said that confirming after the election is just fine  some will criticize such a decision and say it was nothing more than an attempt to save a seat on the court in the hopes that a democrat will be permitted to fill it  but that would not be our intention  mr  president  if that were the course we were to choose in the senate   to not consider holding hearings until after the election  instead  it would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is under way  and it is  action on a supreme court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over  source  politifactso  if republicans really wanted to play by biden s  rule   garland should have gotten a vote in november featured image via monica shipper getty images
