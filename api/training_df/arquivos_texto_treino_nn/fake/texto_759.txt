the congressional black caucus is a very influential voice in the house of representatives  most republicans are hesitant to criticize them as a group  since they already have enough problems with public perception regarding their attitudes on issues of race  therefore  it s a pretty powerful thing when the congressional black caucus comes out with a major position  which they did on monday this group of lawmakers has banded together to take a very controversial stand  which is to call for the resignation of the racist keebler elf who likes to call himself america s attorney general  jeff sessions  they said in a statement  attorney general sessions is unfit to serve as the top law enforcement official in the nation and should resign from the position immediately  as the old saying goes   fool me once  shame on you  fool me twice  shame on me   attorney general sessions is treating congress and the american people like fools  the caucus voted on whether or not to publicly call for sessions to step down even before the washington post revealed on friday that  once again  sessions had not been truthful under oath  the post story alleges that united states intelligence listened in on phone calls held by russian ambassador sergey kislyak  in which he explicitly said that he had conversations about the  presidential campaign with sessions  whom he met with repeatedly  sessions has forcefully denied this while under oath the congressional black caucus went on to say of those revelations  every day the department of justice prosecutes people for lying under oath  yet the man who leads the department has lied under oath on more than one occasion  exactly  forget resignation   jeff sessions needs to be prosecuted  if any of us did what he has done  we d be in prison for years  this man definitely should not be any kind of law enforcement officer  much less the top one  he is a disgrace to the constitution and to the department of justice  hopefully  the congressional black caucus s influence moves others to respond to sessions  grave transgressions and lawbreaking in kind featured image via win mcnamee getty images
