the contrast between the obama white house and the trump white house seems to grow more and more stark every single day  while you d struggle to find a real scandal during president obama s entire two terms  it would be nearly impossible to count the number of scandals currently plaguing the trump white house more than that  though  it seems that the staff has given up trying to be professional  during a conference call on monday  about one of the most pressing issues in international relations  iran  staffers were heard in the background chatting about things like lesbian blowup dolls  i kid you not two reporters  tara mckelvey of the bbc and jackie alemany of cbs both tweeted about the background chatter during the briefing call on iran  you could hear an ad in the background  a man seemed to be saying  inflatable dolls  and  a lesbian   tara mckelvey   taramckelvey  july    may never know what was really said during that call or if i heard things wrong  but i ll certainly remember the sounds   and those words  tara mckelvey   taramckelvey  july    wh still struggles w conference calls  v weird oh comment from unmuted caller during iran briefing   my inflatable doll is a lesbian   jackie alemany   jaxalemany  july    may be the first time trump staffers were caught talking about sex dolls  but it s not the first time they were caught not taking advantage of the mute button  a conference call on the budget in may was described this way as mulvaney attempted to answer questions  open phone lines featuring a crying baby  an intermittent hacking cough  and patriotic hold music quickly drowned him out  some reporters eventually unmuted their phones  revolting with laughter and exclamations of disbelief over the line  there has to be a better system   a reporter on the call complained over the tune of yankee doodle dandy source  cbs newstrump has been at this for six months now  he brands himself as a great leader and he is extremely critical of the appearances of others  if not his own   the out of control conference calls are an easy thing to fix  yet his staff refuses  that s not leadership  that s chaos  which  if you think about it  is the perfect metaphor for everything trump featured image via drew angerer getty images
