republicans are poised to take healthcare away from millions of americans  but incoming democratic rep  lisa blunt rochester won t let them do so without a fight during an appearance on cnn with jake tapper  rochester took on two republicans over their pathetic ideas to replace the affordable care act and she made it clear that she definitely belongs in the house of representatives darrell issa and marsha blackburn spewed quite a bit of nonsense during the panel discussion  with blackburn insisting that repealing obamacare would make health care cheaper and that nobody would fall through the cracks  the goal is to make certain that everyone has access to affordable heath care   blackburn said   and then as you phase out  let s say the insurance components  title i of the obamacare bill  and you set that up to phase out  so you get rid of the mandate  you get rid of the excise tax  you allow portability and you pass legislation of across state line health insurance and open up the insurance marketplace  so blackburn s solution is to strip americans of the insurance over time and then replace the law with new laws that don t have anything to do with the current protections obamacare provides she also doesn t appear to understand that obamacare already makes health insurance more affordable and accessible and that without the mandate many young americans will simply opt out of buying insurance  which will weaken the pool and make insurance more expensive rochester responded by informing blackburn that obamacare not only makes health insurance affordable and accessible  it provides many protections that would be lost by repealing the law  that was a landmark i will always remember   the delaware democrat said   that was sort of like seeing an fdr thing in my own lifetime  i talked to a lot of people in my state  and everybody agreed that no law is perfect  but to the extent that we ve touched every single american  everything from dealing with pre existing conditions to discriminating against women for your coverage to your children who are  years or under being able to covered  there are so many good things  and what i would hope is that we would come together and say   okay  what are things that we can agree on   there are parts to this that you can t just pull apart  it s not that simple  issa  meanwhile  added his idea to replace obamacare that has nothing to do with making healthcare accessible and affordable  he not only wants to eliminate federal subsidies that would prevent low income individuals and families from affording health insurance  he wants to strip patients of their right to pursue legal action if their doctor or hospital screws up their care  like removing the wrong leg during an operation rochester had a response to that as well  i hope that we will come up with the solutions before we try to get rid of something that will impact all americans   she said   i think it would be malpractice  pun intended  here s the video via youtube repealing obamacare is going to be more difficult than republicans realize  not only would they enrage millions of americans  they d be pissing off their own constituents since many conservatives in red states also rely on obamacare but these republican ideas are not a real plan  they fail to address most of the aspects of obamacare that people like  which rochester listed such as requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre existing conditions and treating women equally taking health care away from americans while stripping them of their rights as patients does nothing but hurt people and it would cause the uninsured rate to skyrocket and return america back to the not so distant days when a major health crisis could cause a family to go bankrupt and lose their home  it s time for republicans to accept that obamacare should remain intact and move on to dealing with real problems that need solutions featured image via screenshot
