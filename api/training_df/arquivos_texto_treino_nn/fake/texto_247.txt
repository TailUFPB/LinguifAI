if republicans have their way  rape victims will continue to be terrorized by their rapists the victim was only  years old when christopher mirasolo raped her and impregnated her  despite also threatening her life  mirasolo only spent six months in prison  only to spend four more years in prison for sexually assaulting a  year old girl that being said  mirasolo should not be allowed anywhere near a child and should still be rotting in prison but a michigan judge has decided that mirasolo should have joint custody of the child his victim gave birth to eight years ago according to the detroit news  county officials surveyed the victim s use of food stamps  aid she relies on to take care of her eight year old son for some reason  the county connected her to mirasolo and a dna test was taken  it appears the county was searching for a reason to kick her and her son off the food stamp program so they did all of this without her consent well  despite the fact that mirasolo is the victim s rapist  sanilac county circuit judge gregory s  ross gave him joint custody of child  ordered the victim to move back to michigan  and gave her address to mirasolo in other words  judge ross just put a woman s life in danger and endangered a child and by giving mirasolo joint custody  he is allowing a rapist to continue terrorizing his victim  i think this is all crazy   the victim told the detroit news   they never explained anything to me  i was receiving about   a month in food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him  i guess they were trying to see how to get some of the money back  her attorney is also rightfully pissed off this is insane   attorney rebecca kiessling said   nothing has been right about this since it was originally investigated  he was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere  but the system is victimizing my client  who was a child herself when this all happened  and the same scenario could play out across the nation if republicans have their way  house republicans recently passed a bill banning abortion after  weeks and you can be damn sure they will keep trying to ban abortion entirely  with zero exceptions for rape victims  that means rapists will be able to seek joint custody in order to make their victim s lives a living hell  imagine having to interact with the person who raped you and having to hand your child over to them it s a terrifying scenario that no rape victim should have to face  conservatives are constantly telling us that rape victims should carry these pregnancies to term because the baby isn t to blame  but as long as rapists are able to pursue custody and terrorize their victims for the rest of their lives  women should never lose the right to choose  because no one should be forced to live their life in terror and fear featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
