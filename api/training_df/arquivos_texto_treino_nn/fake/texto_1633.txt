donald trump may be one of the most bitter  petty people on the planet  several weeks ago  trump announced that he would not be attending the white house correspondents dinner in washington because he couldn t handle the media s criticism  as the wh correspondents dinner finally took place last night without trump  he basically threw a fit during a rally in harrisburg  pennsylvania because the event was held  without the president  if trump expected the annual event to be canceled because the country s commander in chief decided to be a temperamental man baby  he was proven wrong last night   and obviously couldn t handle the fact that the media and several celebrities still wanted to go  in an unhinged  unpresidential rant  trump blasted the media and all in attendance of the wh correspondents dinner trump lied and said he could not possibly more thrilled  to be far away from the  washington swamp   where the reporters were consoling each other in a hotel ballroom   trump then bragged about the size of his crowds in comparison to the dinner before pointing to the cameras and saying they would actually rather be here   trump s delusional fans loved every second of it  and were soon chanting  cnn sucks   encouraging trump to go off even more on  fake news   he said  they would love to be with us here tonight  but they re trapped at the dinner which will be very  very boring  with the encouragement from the crowd  trump then recycled all his usual attacks  such as hillary clinton and the new york times   a tactic trump regularly uses because he isn t intelligent enough to talk about his actual policies if there was ever a speech that displayed just how insecure and small minded trump is  it was this one  you can watch it below featured image via steve pope   getty images
