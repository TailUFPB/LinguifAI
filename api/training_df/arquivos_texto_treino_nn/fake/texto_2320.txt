it is becoming clearer and clearer that donald trump and the people around him have serious ties to vladimir putin and russian operatives  on top of that  the story regarding trump s attorney general  jeff sessions  meeting with the russian ambassador and lying about it under oath completely stepped on what could have been a good news cycle after a surprisingly semi normal speech delivered to a joint session of congress  so  what does trump do in retaliation  why  he takes to twitter  of course first  trump insisted that it was  illegal leaks  and  fake news  that was the real story  not sessions s shading dealings with the russian ambassador and his lies regarding said dealings  when that tactic didn t kill the story  trump tried an even more insane approach  and tweeted a  year old photo of senate minority leader chuck schumer  d ny  with vladimir putin this approach makes no sense at all  considering that team trump keeps saying that there s absolutely nothing wrong with people in congress meeting with foreign diplomats and leaders  be they adversaries or otherwise  however  trump plowed on  and tweeted the following so  let me get this straight  trump s people   and let s face  it likely trump himself   wants a decade  plus old photo of chuck schumer with vladimir putin investigated  but wants the investigation into his people s dealings with russian operatives during a presidential campaign that everyone knows was compromised by russia dropped  that s rich don t fall for it  folks  this is nothing but a ridiculous distraction  where there s smoke  there s fire  there s no smoke with schumer   but there sure as hell is plenty of smoke with trump and co  let s keep our eye on the ball here  and root these treasonous squatters out of our white house featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
