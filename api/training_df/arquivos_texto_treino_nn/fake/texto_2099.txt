we re not sure how this could have possibly happened  i mean  how does one allow a laptop to be stolen which contains sensitive information  even more disconcerting is  how the hell did a secret service agent possibly let someone stroll in  take their sh t  then stroll away  the secret service issued laptop in question contained floor plans for trump tower  information about the hillary clinton email investigation and other national security information  but all of that has gone bye bye on thursday morning  the computer was taken in the brooklyn area and officials are trying to determine if agent marie argentieri was targeted or if the robbery was random  according to the daily news  we re going to go with  targeted  for    alex  it s a very big deal   a police source said   there s data on there that s highly sensitive  they re scrambling like mad  scrambling  you can just look up the gps location of the device there are services for that  services which apparently the highest levels of government don t use  if you lose a cellphone  you can track it better than the secret service can track a missing laptop sources and neighbors say that the thief  a white man who was dressed in black  stepped out of a dark colored sedan  possibly an uber  then went into argentieri s bath beach driveway at about   a m   we told you it was targeted  the black clad then grabbed the computer  a backpack  and other goods then walked away  according to sources  after that  to make his getaway  the thief did not get back into the car he arrived in  but instead  surveillance video shows him strolling away from the brick home wearing a backpack and holding a laptop  it showed somebody running to the car and running back out   a neighbor  mike miguolo    said   they knew what they were doing  absolutely  they knew what they were hitting  this is what was stolen other items stolen include  sensitive  documents  an access keycard  coins  a black zippered bag with the secret service insignia on it and lapel pins from various assignments   including ones involving president trump  the clinton campaign  the united nations general assembly and the pope s visit to new york  sources said in addition  an agency issued radio was also taken  secret service issued laptops contain multiple layers of security including full disk encryption and are not permitted to contain classified information   the secret service said in a statement a second white house fence jumper was taken into custody today  maybe he wanted to return the laptop  idk for the record  there is lojack for laptops  we re just trying to be helpful  trump could inform his administration of certain precautionary steps to take in order to ensure that highly sensitive data is not stolen  however  the former reality show star uses an unsecured android photo by win mcnamee getty images
