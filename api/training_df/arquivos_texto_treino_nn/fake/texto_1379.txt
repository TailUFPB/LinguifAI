trump s third day across seas may end up being his most devastating  sitting down with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  trump opened his mouth and immediately started blundering his way into an international incident as the pair of world leaders sat down  trump seemed to want to get something off his chest that had been bothering him  last week  it was reported that trump had leaked classified intelligence about isis to the russians during their closed door meeting in the oval office  trump s white house frantically denied it before eventually conceding it had happened  but claimed it wasn t that big of a deal  then news came that it was an israeli spy that trump had just exposed by his careless leak and now trump  sitting in israel  wanted to make one thing clear  he never shared the part about the source being israeli  he said this on international television trump just said he never mentioned israel in his meeting w  russians  that was not the issue story never alleged trump divulged source   pic twitter com   kyle griffin     may    s  uh  a pretty stunning admission  the implications were immediately clear to everyone but trump  trump may as well have just confirmed that it was an israeli informant  the spy is likely to face death if caught by isis  who now  thanks to trump s internationally broadcast statement  know to look for one unreal  trump seems to have just accidentally confirmed israel was the source of the intel with this admission  https   t co ypcqpadyte  kyle griffin     may    just used his photo op with netanyahu to defend sharing sensitive intel with the russians in the oval  saying he never said  israel    joy reid   joyannreid  may    lacks the cognitive acuity to keep all this stuff straight  and he s likely getting worse  https   t co   dana houle   danahoule  may    hamfisted  non denial denial  is textbook trump  the initial report never claimed that trump divulged the nationality of the spy  his denial of doing so is fighting a point that nobody was trying to make  it wasn t that he gave away the source  until now   it s that he handed over information to the russians which their intelligence community could use to track down the source again  nobody ever reported that he mentioned israel  the question was always whether his reference to specific intel compromised them  https   t co   benjy sarlin   benjysarlin  may    is beleaguered by so many scandals and lies he likely cannot remember what his position is on any of them  it may help explain why he constantly contradicts himself and his staff when it comes to which lie he plans on using to defend himself  white house aides have told reporters that nobody wants to go on television to defend him anymore because he so quickly changes his stories that anything they say will be exposed as a complete lie within hours meanwhile  trump seems oblivious to even a basic level of competency  leaking intel to the russians while bragging in the oval office is bad  confirming the source of the intel was israeli while sitting next to the israeli prime minister is a whole new level of bad featured image via twitter
