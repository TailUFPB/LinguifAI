there s a major problem with trump considering ivanka and her husband  jared kushner  for official positions in the white house  it s not that they re likely to be too close to his business ties  but rather  it s because ignoring the nepotism law and giving family members plum jobs like this is the act of a king  not a democratic president the very opposite of america while positions for them in trump s white house are not yet set in stone  one of trump s advisers has hinted loudly at ivanka and jared having formal positions in his administration  economist robert reich sees a serious problem here as anyone should and said on his facebook page  is anyone else uneasy about trump s daughter and son in law becoming white house advisors to president trump  it s not just their extensive trump business holdings and conflicts of interest that worry me  it s also their family ties we ve elected a president  not a king a president hires advisors  a king bestows privileges and titles on his family a president wants advice from experts who will tell him what s in america s best interest  a king wants advice from people who will tell him what s in his own personal best interest a president assembles a white house staff  a king assembles a court a president dismisses advisors who don t perform  a king doesn t get rid of family members  except when he cuts off their heads  and that s it  in a nutshell  that s the difference between the elected president of a democracy  and a man who would crown himself king like cheetolini seems to want to do what has the dark side of america done in electing this autocratic demagogue  trump supporters are brainwashed  that much is clear  there are so many conflicts of interest with trump as president that it s insane  now  those conflicts involve him giving his daughter and son in law jobs like a king bestowing lands and titles on his family  just like reich said of course  there are people close to trump who believe that the nepotism law doesn t apply  like kellyanne conway  she recently said that the law has exceptions that can open up a  realm of possibilities   she then tried to assure us that  there will be complete distinction and separation   without any ambiguity sure  right  and trump canceled the press conference where he was supposed to explain when and how he was divesting from his businesses because reasons people whined up one side and down the other about the bush dynasty and the clinton dynasty during the election  but who sees a problem with the dynasty that trump is literally setting up  one that is unlike either the bushes or the clintons  trump s ensuring that his family has the ties they need to to take over after he s gone  whether he s gone via election or death  reich is right  we ve elected someone who s going to behave more like a king than a democratic president  if trump saw himself as president  he d stick by the nepotism law and the emoluments clause of the constitution like they were etched in concrete  rather than looking for loopholes and exceptions to both featured image by mark wilson via getty images
