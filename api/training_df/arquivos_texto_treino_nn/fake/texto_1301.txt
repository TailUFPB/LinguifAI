today  donald trump yanked us out of the paris climate agreement something we helped craft and onto which every country in the world but two signed and the backlash has been swift and harsh  he s lost two members of his business council  mayors of blue collar cities like pittsburgh have blasted him even though he claims to have done this for them  world leaders have blown up at us  and even the weather channel has jumped on trump the weather channel might be expected to do this because they re in the business of reporting and forecasting the weather  which is directly influenced by the climate  they also report on other natural events affected by the weather  so  to express their displeasure at trump s completely idiotic move  they ve done this to their front page yeah  there isn t much we can add to that the idiots who are crowing over this decision  who actually believe that this will  make america great again   can t see past their own noses  they have no concept of how the world actually works outside their own bubbles  as such  they have no concept of how their pathetic bubbles are affected by things like climate change  and that ignorant and myopic view hurts us all

in december  irreversible and we firmly believe that the paris agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet  societies and economies  french president emmanuel macron yelled at us separately  too  i tell you firmly tonight  we will not renegotiate a less ambitious accord  there is no way  don t be mistaken on climate  there is no plan b because there is no planet b
