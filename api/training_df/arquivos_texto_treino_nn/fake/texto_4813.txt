for years   if not decades   liberals have complained that the nation is on the verge of becoming an oligarchy  which in the most simplistic terms possible  means that corporations  and the wealthy  are more important than regular people  well  a ruling in los angeles might not be the biggest or the most wide reaching news story  but when a judge ruled that the victims  yes  the victims  of the horrific mass shooting in aurora  colorado would have to pay for the sins of daring to sue the movie theater  our wall between government and corporations crumbled even more on july     an orange haired  year old named james holmes entered a screening of the batman movie  the dark knight rises  he proceeded to set off tear gas and grenades before peppering the theater with hundreds of rounds of ammunition  he killed  and injured   at that point  it was the largest mass shooting in history  holmes was sentenced to more than   years in prison  so there was some justice some the living victims of the shooting sued cinemark theaters  claiming that if they had had guards and better security camera coverage  the shooting might not have happened and even if it had  there might have been fewer casualties  they lost  now  we can debate the validity of the lawsuit all day long  but to add insult to dozens of brutal injuries  the theater countersued  claiming that the victims owed them    in legal fees and court costs  the theater won  they now owe the theater    we can also debate the validity of this ruling all day long  but the bare truth is that cinemark didn t need to sue  they were just being dicks  the shooting or the impending lawsuit didn t hurt cinemark  their annual revenues are just south of   billion a year and rising steadily  they could have easily eaten the legal costs with just a few concession sales  only a slight exaggeration  the worst thing this ruling did  other than re victimize people who have to live with the traumatic memory and for some  permanent injuries  was to send a message  the message is that if citizens dare to stand up to their corporate overlords  we should be prepared to be slapped down hard and in the most expensive ways possible  cinemark should have just let this go  but it was in their interest  like it s in the interests of large corporations throughout the nation  to let us know  in no uncertain terms  that we have no voice featured image via bloomsberries flickr
