one of donald trump s latest conspiracy theories he s been spreading far and wide about his opponent hillary clinton is that she s on drugs and there should be a drug test before the next debate of course  he s likely saying this  because as per usual  anything said about him he turns around to say about hillary  he s a master projector and this  drug test  poppycock is no different  he s been sniffing constantly through the debates  and many have asked if he may be on cocaine or something else when white house press secretary josh earnest was just asked about a potential drug test  he said  you re telling me that the candidate who snorted his way through the first two debates is accusing the other candidate of taking drugs  that s a curious development in the campaign  watch for yourself here   presssec on trump s call for candidate drug test  trump  snorted his way through the first two debates   https   t co pcmfmeuldy  politico   politico  october    course  when pressed if he was insinuated trump was on drugs  earnest said he was joking however  one does wonder why trump keeps sniffing  is he sick  does he lack stamina  is he taking drugs to stay awake  who s really to know  but since trump did raise the question of drug tests  maybe we should find out  maybe he s saying it to deflect because everyone has been questioning him see  two can play at this conspiracy theory game how about we stick to the issues  or the fact that trump is still deflecting from his lack of showing his taxes  you know someone has something to hide when they can t answer questions and choose to make lame claims about their opponent good on earnest for laughing it off  as we all should featured image via video screen capture   chip somodevilla getty images
