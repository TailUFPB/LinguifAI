at this point in trump s disastrous presidency  it s pretty clear that the only one that thinks he s doing a great job is the underserving potus himself  even his own supporters have lost faith in him and are turning away at record speed  despite his rapidly plummeting approval rating  trump still thinks he s the greatest thing to happen to america   or at least  he ll continue to think that until he sees this according to msnbc s kyle griffin  americans are so turned off by trump that they don t even want to get anywhere near a product he touches  apparently  asking for trump s support is so toxic that it is basically suicide for businesses  that s quite strange for a reality television star who brags about how good of a businessman he is already  we saw trump make endorsements on his twitter feed  it turns out  those inappropriate  shoutouts  did way more harm than good  nbc news reported  when donald trump won the oval office  critics worried he would use his elevated stature to enhance his personal power to pick winners and losers by endorsing products  but new consumer survey data from simmons research suggest the trump presidency may be having the opposite effect on the trump brand  according to the new data    of americans would not use and might even boycott any product that trump endorses  even amongst republicans  support is low   only   of gopers said they would be more likely to use a product if trump endorsed it  simmons scientist steven millman explained this phenomenon  a strong association between trump and a brand is likely to be damaging to the brand  unless its consumers are strong conservative  this actually makes perfect sense  trump has singlehandedly destroyed his own trump brand by creating one of the most hateful  controversial presidential campaigns america had ever seen  his hotels are going down in flames  and so are his other self branded companies  even his daughter  ivanka  is facing business struggles thanks to her father s horrible performance  so it only seems pretty natural that the association with trump s disgraced name would have the same effect on other businesses it s official  most of america hates trump  and we want him to know it featured image via mark wilson   getty images
