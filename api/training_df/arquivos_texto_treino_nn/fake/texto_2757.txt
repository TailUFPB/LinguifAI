joe scarborough says donald trump is acting like a dictator because of the way he fired acting attorney general sally yates yates stood up to trump and refused to defend his unconstitutional executive order banning people from entering the united states if they are traveling from seven specific countries in the middle east and africa the order violates constitutional rights and caused worldwide chaos over the weekend while sparking protests and condemnation around the globe  the acting attorney general  sally yates  has betrayed the department of justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the united states   trump said in a statement from the white house   ms  yates is an obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration  trump s words shocked the morning joe host  who compared the way trump fired yates to how a tyrant would do it  the word  betrayed   using the word betrayed for somebody  that s frightening   scarborough said on tuesday morning   that s what an autocrat would use  whoever put that word in there  an autocrat is just another term for  dictator  or  tyrant  scarborough went on to slam trump for acting like a petulant child  there are people that can have reasonable differences without saying that  if they don t agree with you  they ve betrayed you  that is frightening  chilling language  whether they had a right to do this or not  but saying somebody  betrayed  the justice department because they don t agree with you  take that to venezuela  ok  we don t really want to use that sort of language here  it s time for you guys to grow up  here s the video via youtube apparently  donald trump intends to fire anyone in our government who disagrees with him  and that s dangerous yates  as acting attorney general  explained her responsibilities in a letter that makes it clear that she was trying to protect the integrity of the justice department by not jumping to defend an order without all the facts  my responsibility is to ensure that the position of the department of justice is not only legally defensible  but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts  in addition  i am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right  at present  i am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am i convinced that the executive order is lawful  this is particularly scary because once trump has full control of the justice department he will cripple it and no amount of protests or lawsuits will prevent him from doing so  we may even lose the power to oust trump via elections  as long as trump is allowed to solidify his power  no election will ever be fair and free again  and he will use the justice department to make sure of it  which means we will have no legal means to save democracy featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
