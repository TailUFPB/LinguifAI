this donald trump supporter will be ringing in the new year with egg on his face townhall columnist and retired army colonel kurt schlichter took to twitter on wednesday to whine about the united nations resolution condemning israeli settlements on palestinian land in fact  schlichter s twitter feed is full of complaints about the resolution even though america has supported such condemnations before and has always condemned israeli settlements beyond their national boundaries  the israelis have killed men  women  and children in the gaza strip to make this expansion possible with little regard for human rights  some israeli lawmakers are even calling for committing genocide against the palestinians  it should also be noted that the israeli settlements are preventing peace talks from moving forward because it s useless to talk about a two state solution when israel is busy gobbling up land that belongs to the palestinians schlichter thinks that those who condemn israel are like the jews who were forced to help the nazis at auschwitz if you are jewish and supporting barack obama and john kerry  well  you would have made a fine helper at auschwitz   kurt schlichter   kurtschlichter  december     that didn t sit well with the auschwitz memorial museum  so they responded to schlichter s post the tragedy of prisoners of auschwitz   their complicated moral dilemmas which today we can hardly comprehend should not be instrumentalized https   t co   auschwitz memorial   auschwitzmuseum  december    replied by suggesting his knowledge of the holocaust and the jewish people is superior to that of the auschwitz memorial museum your opinion is important and deserves respectful attention  however  i disagree  respectfully  with your conclusion here  auschwitzmuseum  kurt schlichter   kurtschlichter  december    even schlichter s followers ripped him a new one for it  kurtschlichter if an auschwitz memorial foundation thinks you re scum  might want to rethink your life decisions  as a therapist  i d agree  kelly   kellydraper  december    does it feel to get called out by the people at the official auschwitz memorial  you hate mongering low life dirtbag   kurtschlichter  charles johnson   greenfootballs  december    kurtschlichter this is a horrible thing to say  respectfully  can be very pro israel and want to explore two state sol and end to violence  gabby revilla lugo   gabbyrevlugo  december    kurtschlichter  equating a legitimate policy argument over us policy toward israel to genocide is despicable   suzanne trimel   strimel  december    kurtschlichter you have a greater grasp of auschwitz than  auschwitzmuseum do you  i disagree  disrespectfully  with your conclusion here   danny wallace   dannywallace  december    kurtschlichter seriously  back down and apologize  you are wrong here   auschwitzmuseum  andrew kornblatt   akornblatt  december    kurtschlichter  akornblatt when the fucking auschwitz memorial says you re being tasteless  you need to take a step back and examine   lain iwakura wannabe   publiusshepard  december    kurtschlichter  auschwitzmuseum kurt i think the auschwitz museum might just know better than you on this one   em dash     december    goes on to accuse people of supporting policies that keep jews from praying at holy sites like the western wall  but jews already pray at the western wall and are not being barred from doing so  a two state solution would not change that  nor does the united nation resolution condemning the continued construction of settlements  nobody is arguing that israel doesn t have the right to exist  but what israel is doing to the palestinian people is inexcusable and is only inflaming the middle east  the united states cannot afford to sacrifice more blood and treasure fighting the entire muslim world but that s what israel is pushing for by continuing to build settlements that make peace impossible featured image via screenshot
