while the final vote tally won t be in for quite some time  at this point it s looking like the massive victory republicans were granted yesterday was due largely in part to gerrymandering   perfectly legal rigging of the vote that parties take advantage of during the census  because republicans controlled most state legislatures during the time of the last census  republican votes tend to count more than democratic votes do that s why  despite the simple fact that more people probably voted for hillary clinton  we are facing at least four years of a donald trump presidency  we actually saw exactly how this would play out in   when republicans took the house despite losing by over a million in the popular vote  democrats simply can t afford close races it s hard to admit  but donald trump was right about something   the election was rigged  by state and congressional republicans  and then by obstructionists  hopefully  this loss teaches the democrats that stayed home and leftists that refused to unify that we can t afford to put ideology over pragmatism  when the other side is cheating  the only solution is to boost turnout beyond what they can cope with  that s really the only way to see a silver lining in any of this   maybe people will learn  the democratic party picked up seats in the house and senate   enough to give the gop a taste of  no    but the next four years are looking bleak here s a video that explains the process of gerrymandering and how republicans have orchestrated it so that your vote doesn t count the way it should also  you should know there is an interstate compact between quite a few states   and the list is growing   that are pledging to give their electors to the winner of the popular vote the next time around  that d be a win for democracy  if we d had that in play this time around  we might not be looking at a donald trump presidency  and it would mean that every vote does  indeed  count   right now  unless you live in a swing state  you probably already know whether your vote counts before you cast it photo by john sommers ii getty images
