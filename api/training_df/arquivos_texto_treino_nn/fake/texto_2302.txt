donald trump may have just inadvertently admitted guilt during his bizarre and conspiracy riddled claim that president obama ordered the trump tower to be wiretapped in a flurry of early morning tweets  how s that pivot going  republicans   president trump accused president obama  as early as october  with launching a nixonian mccarthy esque witch hunt against his campaign in order to undermine him once again  president trump has shown a complete lack of understanding about the separation of powers enshrined in the united states constitution  contrary to popular  right wing  belief  the president of the united states does not have the authority to order a wiretapping of an individual s house  phone  or place or business but don t take our word for it  let democratic congressman ted lieu of california explain it mr  president  if there was a wiretap at trump tower  that means a fed judge found probable cause of crime which means you are in deep shit  https   t co   ted lieu   tedlieu  march    case that wasn t enough  let him explain it one more time either  realdonaldtrump is paranoid like nixon  or judge found probable cause of crime for  wiretap  either way our president is in trouble   ted lieu   tedlieu  march    is right  either way you look at it  trump is in trouble  he is either painfully ignorant of the constitution  has done something that would warrant probable cause  which could be criminal   or both  our money is on both  he s demonstrated that he completely off his rockers and ill equipped for the office of the presidency even if president obama did recommend that trump s phones and buildings be tapped  which is highly unlikely  but if true  thanks obama    it certainly wouldn t be without merit  since august   with the resignation of paul manafort  intelligence officials have been looking into whether or not the trump campaign was in collusion with the russian government  and over the last several months  many damning revelations have come out about the campaign s contacts  which were previously denied maybe the trump white house should be bugged  their lack of transparency and honesty has been frightening and beneath the awesome responsibility of the executive branch maybe this wiretapped information  if it happened  is the information comey and the fbi is withholding  according to senator ron wyden only time will tell  the drip is turning into a flow featured image via alex wong getty images
