donald trump thought he hit a slam dunk with moderate and independent voters when he decided to visit mexico  pundits and right wing demagogues declared it  presidential  and said the visit was proof of a  softening  on immigration then trump went to arizona  and well  that all changed instead of taking a  softer  approach to the issues of mexico  immigration and illegal immigration  trump launched into his classic talking points that a wall will be built  and that mexico will pay for it   that the united states is being swamped with   million  illegal immigrants  even though that number is closer to  million   and that mexican immigration poses the same threat as isis well the speech in arizona was the last straw for one trump adviser  jacob m  monty  who advises the republican nominee on latino issues  among other things just last week  monty posted on his facebook that trump is  the only candidate who has the skill and will to work with congress to improve security and deal compasionately with the undocumented population in the us  in a facebook post on thursday  monty denounced trump and severed ties after he refused to take his advice and instead pandered to xenophobia and with that  another trump staffer leaves do to the candidate s blatant racism  xenophobia and lack of respect for those who know what s best although monty has not said who he will be supporting at this point for the presidency  trump s camp should take the opportunity to truly reflect on who they want to vote for him  the angry whites that will vote for him regardless of how  soft  he goes on immigration  or conservative leaning hispanic and latino voters he desperately needs another public embarrassment for the trump campaign couldn t have come quick enough  this mexico trip certainly did not work out well in the candidate s favor thank you  jacob monty  for putting principle over party  maybe this decision will have trump s closest advisers thinking long and hard about how to pursue sensitive issues that affect millions of proud people featured image via jacob m  monty facebook
