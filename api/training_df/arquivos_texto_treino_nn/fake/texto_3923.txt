early voting has concluded in nevada  and tallies don t really favor trump  in fact  he and other republicans may have already lost the state  given that democrats currently have a   vote lead just in clark county  that s more than the margin by which president obama won in  democrats have a   vote lead overall in the state  not including rural counties  and that could spell doom for the entire republican ticket statewide since it gives democrats a six point lead going into election day  it s not just trump s chances bottoming out  it could also be the republicans  hopes to retain control of the senate in other words  there are currently   tiny blows killing the gop s hopes for that state jon ralston  nevada s top political analyst  says that trump needs a miracle to win at this point  so do republicans   this could cost them harry reid s senate seat  as well as the state s two house seats and the state legislature nearly half of the state voted early  including higher numbers of democrats than republicans  and that just compounds the gop s woes there  if voter turnout approaches  percent total on tuesday  then two thirds of the vote is already in  the remaining votes would almost all have to go to trump and the gop for them to win anything there nevada s diversity is a big part of what s giving trump problems   latino voters kept the cardenas market open until  because they were turning out in such large numbers  in fact  in clark county  friday was the single largest early voting day they ve seen the funny thing is that trump has been polling within just a few points of hillary in nevada  so this probably comes as a shock to republicans  but republicans were pretty sure of a romney victory in   and he lost badly  their so called  autopsy report  revealed significant problems that they totally ignored  and this is the result trump has almost no path to the white house without nevada featured image via drew angerer getty images
