taking donald trump s erratic  unpredictable behavior into full consideration  it s safe to say that almost nothing is certain in his presidency besides his talent for humiliating the united states and incriminating himself with the help of his equally corrupt inner circle while it s mildly entertaining  and depressing  to watch trump melt down as his russia scandal closes in on him  it s even more fun to see gems from the past come back to bite him in the a   this morning  trump had one of his twitter tantrums  where he trashed former fbi director james comey  that should come as no surprise  because trump has spent the last several months insulting the fbi and intelligence agencies because he s bitter about the russian scandal  so it s pretty hilarious that this tweet  straight from the trump campaign  has resurfaced that s right   then trump surrogate sarah huckabee sanders   who has just been promoted to white house press secretary due to sean spicer s resignation   previously trashed the very  losing  behavior that trump has been doing for months now  sanders had posted this in november  right before the election  in response to speculation that a few fbi agents were playing politics we would honestly love to see trump defend his behavior now  he s spent so much time trashing federal investigators and firing everyone who might be a threat to him in the russia investigation  it s pretty much impossible to believe he could be innocent after all this trump not only fired comey  but he has attacked the ex fbi director  referring to him as a  nut job  who is  not a smart guy   now he s threatening to fire special counsel robert mueller if mueller investigates his finances and businesses  and unfortunately  sanders has taken a similar attitude now that she is closer to trump  completely forgetting about her tweet from november  she more recently stated that comey is guilty of  atrocities  whether she stands by it today or not  sanders  tweet is telling in its exposure of an administration with no integrity  trump s attacks on these prosecutors are merely a sign that he will keep losing featured image via alex wong   getty images
