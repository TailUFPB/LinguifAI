donald trump loves talking about email scandals  apparently   so then why hasn t he mentioned the millions of emails  lost  by the bush administration  on april     an estimated five million emails relevant to an ongoing investigation of eight u s  attorneys being fired were lost  as it turns out that number is closer to  million the new york times reported washington  april    political advisers to president bush may have improperly used their republican national committee e mail accounts to conduct official government business  and some communications that are required to be preserved under federal law may be lost as a result  white house officials said wednesday of the   white house officials with political duties     including karl rove  the chief political strategist   have republican national committee accounts that are supposed to be used only for campaign related work so  while hillary clinton has got plenty of attention for emails she lost  the media has  forgotten  about this scandal by the bush administration  big surprise  right  it s not like it s relevant  or anything  condoleezza rice and colin powell also had private email  but we don t talk about that  either  i wonder why  it couldn t have anything to do with the need for ratings  or the need to somehow create a close race between hillary  who is eminently qualified  and the raging dumpster fire that is trump  could it even more worryingly  many times cheney s emails were unavailable for weeks at a time  with archives also unavailable  and yet  not a peep from republicans  and certainly nothing from donald trump  it s almost as if  after  years of non scandals failing to go anywhere  they re getting a little bit desperate donald trump  on the other hand  has set the bar lower than ever before when it comes to transparency  he won t release medical records  he won t release tax returns  and he won t reveal his business connections or how he intends to profit from the office of the presidency  his war on the press has made it clear he has no respect for the first amendment or the right to dissent  and his scandals are only just getting started   something tells me investigations of trump won t be so fruitless
