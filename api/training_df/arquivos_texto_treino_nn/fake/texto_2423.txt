on tuesday night  one lone city  richmond  california  unanimously voted to impeach donald trump  they hope they are only the first  unfortunately with this president it s oddly appropriate   said richmond city councilmember jael myrick councilmember gayle mclaughlin spearheaded the resolution  which calls on congress to investigate the president s business holdings  something his critics believe are grounds for impeachment   this is our voice   she said   this is our country  we have a right to speak up  of course  cities can t impeach a president  that s up to congress  as one resident mentioned  actually you don t have a voice because the gop controls congress and you people are stupid enough to think congress will impeach trump   said richmond resident mark wassberg another resident had an answer for that  a lot of politicians aren t willing to go on the record to do this because it can go against them   said richmond resident ellen faden   but as grass roots  as bernie said  we have to start from the grass roots  source  abc  newshere s the video while richmond may be the first city to formally  and yes  toothlessly  endorse impeachment  the movement is gaining momentum among the voters  so far  nearly a quarter million people have signed a change org petition for impeachment  and that s just the tip of the iceberg  there are other petitions as well whether or not it will happen is still to be seen  trump has already violated his oath of office by profiting off of the presidency  he has already violated the emoluments clause in the constitution  which states that leaders cannot accept large gifts from foreign states  there might be several examples  but the most damning is the fact that  after years of being denied a trademark for plastering his name all over china  his trademark was suddenly approved last week richmond is in a fortunate situation  its congressperson and its two senators are all democratic  it might just take some gentle urging from other cities and constituents to get the ball rolling  this is certainly a start  if impeachment  pence  is what we want featured image by joe raedle via getty images
