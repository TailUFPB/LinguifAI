kellyanne conway was absolutely grilled by chuck todd on friday because donald trump has been picking goldman sachs executives for his cabinet donald trump spent a good part of his campaign trashing hillary clinton for having mere connections to goldman sachs  now he has picked three goldman sachs alums  including steve bannon as his chief policy strategist  steven mnuchin as treasury secretary  and gary cohn as the head of the national economic council chuck todd began by playing video of trump demonizing ted cruz and hillary clinton for taking donations from goldman sachs  they have total control over him just like they have total control over hillary clinton   trump said  claiming that he doesn t need money from goldman sachs and that doesn t want it  therefore  goldman sachs has  no control  over him  he railed against goldman sachs   todd told conway   three goldman sachs alums  fairly prominent positions  how is that not hypocritical  of course  conway tried to spin in defense of trump  he railed against their political influence   conway said  which doesn t really make sense since trump literally just gave three goldman sachs executives tremendous political influence nevertheless  conway claimed that they  don t have influence over him politically and they will not have influence over him politically in the white house  however  trump has said that goldman sachs  owns  ted cruz because he took loans from them  but that logic backfired because it turns out trump has also taken loans from goldman sachs  which according to trump means they own him  and now three of them are in trump s cabinet todd once again cornered conway and demanded answers first  he wanted to know how she would react if hillary clinton had won and appointed three goldman sachs alums  she claimed that she wouldn t have whined about but we all know trump and all of his supporters would be throwing a collective temper tantrum the todd wondered   was the trashing of goldman just simply campaign rhetoric and sort of b s   the answer is yes but conway again went with the whole  he was just talking about political influence  line  and todd refused to let conway get away with that bullshit  those are political appointments   todd exclaimed but the facts don t matter to team trump  and conway simply kept talking and talking and talking to run out the clock and force todd to move one to the next topic here s the video via youtube once again  donald trump gets caught being a complete hypocrite and his team spews bullshit to defend him  these people have no shame and their supporters should be pissed featured image  screenshot
