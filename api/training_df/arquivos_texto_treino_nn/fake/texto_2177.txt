donald trump jr  apparently expects the world to believe that he has had  zero contact  with his father since he was sworn into office  so no need to worry about all that pesky conflict of interest stuff  nothing to see here  folks speaking at a gop fundraiser in dallas on saturday  trump jr  told the crowd that he no longer has any real communications with his dad now that he is the president  i basically have zero contact with him at this point   trump jr  claimed with a straight face trump s son said he believed that he would be  out of politics  and could just return to his regular life  once the election was finally over   but i couldn t   he said  deals are still exciting   he added   but when you re the sort of guy out there every day    fighting in this thing   it s like a great fight  trump supposedly gave all control of his businesses to his two adult sons  donald jr  and eric  when he became president and his assets were to be placed into a trust  but so far  he has offered nothing to prove that he has actually done any of this  the closest he has come to verifying that he has divested himself from his business interests is a stack of folders he pointed to at a press conference that supposedly held the proof the office of government and ethics  oge  has cried foul over this arrangement from the very beginning  saying trump s entire plan is wholly inadequate  when it comes to resolving his many conflicts of interest after claiming that they just don t have the time to talk to one another anymore  trump jr  also took the opportunity to stroke his daddy s ego during this weekend s fundraiser   i m watching more take place in two months than i saw in two terms before   he said featured image via jeff vinnick getty images
