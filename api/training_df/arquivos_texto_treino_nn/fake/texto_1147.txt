as the divisions in the nation bubble over  it seems that one person has snapped  and done the unthinkable  opened fire on a baseball practice full of congressional republicans in alexandria  virginia  reports are steadily coming in  and it has been confirmed that house majority whip steve scalise has been shot  he is currently en route to a nearby hospital and is said to be in stable condition  there are also reports that capitol hill police officers and possibly congressional aides have been injured as well  there is currently no reporting available on their condition  reports suggest that the shooter was either taken down by capitol hill police or taken into custody the really sad thing about this incident is that this practice was in preparation for a bipartisan baseball game that is supposed to promote unity between the two parties  further  things would have been much worse if rep  scalise had not been there because capitol police would not have been present without a member of leadership in attendance this is seriously the work of someone truly sick  no one should be killing anyone  for any reason  but certainly  this targeting of lawmakers at a baseball practice that was designed to help the nation take a break from ugly partisan politics is truly beyond the pale  political violence is never acceptable  period if this isn t proof that we really need to turn down the temperature when it comes to the rhetoric and divisions in this nation posthaste  i don t know what is this is a developing story  stay tuned to addicting info for continued updates here is the live feed monitoring this tragedy  via cnn featured image via alex wong getty images
