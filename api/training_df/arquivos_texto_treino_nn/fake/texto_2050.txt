donald trump s white house mouthpiece just gave melissa mccarthy more material to work with on saturday night live as we all know  fbi director james comey revealed during testimony under oath that trump is being investigated for colluding with russia during the  election and has been under investigation for months  comey also confirmed that trump s wiretapping accusation against president obama is bullshit these revelations have given the white house press corps a lot of questions to ask  and sean spicer is not happy about it in particular  spicer has had to deal with questions surrounding former trump campaign manager paul manafort  who has been attempting to spread pro putin propaganda on behalf of russian oligarch oleg deripaska for over a decade again  spicer does not like having to answer questions about trump s ties to russia  he would like the media to ignore them and become propaganda outlets for trump instead  but spicer is not getting his way during wednesday s press briefing  axios reporter jonathan swan asked spicer about manafort s connection to russia and wanted to know if trump knew about it  h was not aware of paul s client in the last decade   spicer claimed before getting snippy   what else is coming out  what else don t we know  where he went to school  who he went to grade school with  who he played with in the sandbox  of course  spicer s credibility imploded on his first day on the job so reporters have no reason to believe him when he claims trump doesn t know something anyway  another reporter attempted to ask a follow up question and that led to yet another testy exchange  which morphed into yet another spicer temper tantrum spicer   i m answering a question  here  reporter   i m asking a question  spicer   no  you re not  the answer to your question is to talk about someone having a client ten years ago that had a consulting company with clients around the world  i don t know what he got paid to do  he was a consultant  he had clients around the world  there was no suggestion he did anything improper but to suggest that the president knew who his clients were from a decade ago is a bit insane  he wasn t a government employee  he did not fill out any paperwork attesting to something  there was nothing he did to suggest at this point that anything was nefarious  he was hired to do a job  he did it plain and simple  here s the video via youtube  sean spicer is seriously terrible at his job  his credibility is shot all to hell and he constantly shoots himself in the foot by getting into confrontations with reporters because they ask certain questions that spicer and trump would rather not have to answer instead of attacking the media  spicer would be better off just answering the questions  because the more defensive he gets  the more it looks like trump has something to hide  and that means spicer will have to answer even more questions featured image via mark wilson getty images
