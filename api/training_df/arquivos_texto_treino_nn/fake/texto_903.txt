canadian prime minister justin trudeau has  like the rest of the world  seen the outrage that is donald trump occupying the american presidency over the last six months  he likely also has the same disgusted opinion of the job trump is doing  not to mention his vulgarity  his lies and conspiracy theories  and his all around unfitness for the office he holds  that sort of thing just might be why prime minister trudeau has shown he has no f cks left to give when it comes to trump  and has decided that  instead of talking to trump  he will instead speak to more competent american government officials instead  to that end  trudeau will become the first canadian prime minister in history to speak to the national governor s association  he says of the move  no countries share a closer bond than canada and the united states  each day  hundreds of thousands of people cross the border to work  travel or visit loved ones  ever more integrated supply chains draw our economies closer together  bringing jobs and prosperity to canadians and americans alike  i will continue to work with all orders of the u s  government to create good  middle class jobs on both sides of the border  and to find solutions to the challenges we face together  while trudeau has  as any dignified leader would   remained civil with trump  it is clear that the two will not be close at all  trudeau sees trump for the buffoon that he is  and has criticized him for his promotion of crude nationalism  his views on climate change  and other topics this is a clear signal that trudeau has no use for trump  he simply has to tolerate the orange one until he is either removed from office or his term expires  until then  it seems trudeau will simply go around trump and deal with other  read  sane and qualified  united states government officials  personally  i think it s a wise move  because dealing with trump would be nothing short of maddening  and it certainly would not serve the interests of people in canada or anywhere else in the world featured image via drew angerer getty images
