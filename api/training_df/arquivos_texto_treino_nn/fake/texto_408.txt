fox news has a problem with sexual predators in its ranks  their gross corporate rape culture is costing them television personalities left and right  first  it was the now deceased mastermind behind the network  roger ailes  then it was bill o reilly  who was  by all accounts  their main star  who had to be canned to save the network s brand after millions were paid to his victims  now  it is happening again   only this time it is eric bolling bolling had his own program  called the specialists  which was relatively new  but he had been with the network for a decade  fox news released a curt statement that read  fox news channel is canceling the specialists  and eric bolling and fox have agreed to part ways amicably  we thank eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck  there was no mention of the sexual harassment charges  but that was clearly the reason  bolling has been accused of sending lewd photos of penises to female fox news employees  bolling  for his part  is  of course  denying the allegations  his lawyer released a statement that reads  mr  bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications  does not believe he sent any such communications  and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made  this all comes on the heels of bolling being suspended after yashar ali of the huffington post came out with an explosive report regarding bolling s conduct in the workplace  bolling is filing a   million lawsuit against yashar for character defamation  it likely won t go anywhere as no one in their right mind would write such a story without concrete evidence that network of right wing propaganda needs to go down the toilet with the rest of the sewage  they are misogynistic  racist  and all around bigoted to their core  they are also pathological liars who should not be allowed to call themselves  news  so long  bolling  hopefully the rest of that vile network follows featured image via logopedia
