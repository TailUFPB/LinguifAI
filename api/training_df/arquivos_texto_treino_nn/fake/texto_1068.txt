like father  like son  donald trump jr  twitter account is getting him into a lot of trouble the morning after republican karen handel won the georgia special election to fill in a vacant seat in the u s  house of representatives  don jr  was giddy and eager to brag about the win  sidestepping the fact that handel had to spend   million  two and a half times her opponent   to win a nailbitter in a district republicans won by over  points just  months ago  don jr  chose to focus on the  historic  nature of the win  karen is a woman karen handel becomes  woman rep ga has sent to congress  still waiting for the glass ceiling stories  or do conservatives not get them   donald trump jr    donaldjtrumpjr  june    for don jr   his tweet shows the dangers of getting all your information from right wing media  it s completely wrong handel is not the first woman representative georgia has sent to congress  democrats have been electing women in georgia for years  and democrats elected the state s first congresswoman cynthia mckinney in   the  glass ceiling  was shattered in georgia long ago   and by democrats unintentionally  don jr gave america an opportunity to look at just how backwards the republican party is  as the hill notes  the gop is pathetically behind on gender equality for their elected officials handel will become just the  gop female lawmaker in the  member house  not including nonvoting delegates  overall  there are  women in the house in the senate  there are  women  including five republicans georgia has sent a handful of democratic women to congress  most recently rep  cynthia mckinney  who served one term from  to  nine other states appear to have never sent a republican woman to congress  arkansas  delaware  louisiana  mississippi  north dakota  oregon  south carolina  vermont and wisconsin republicans have yet to send a single woman to congress in nine states  that s just sad  and waiting until  to finally start to catch up shouldn t allow republicans to get any  glass ceiling  points  this year they are particularly guilty  republicans chose to stand by a man who had repeatedly sexually harassed women around him  bragged about it on tape  and later used sexist attacks against both his critics in the media and his opponent  they elected him president and continue to support him don jr   having been humiliated for passing along the false information  decided to lie about it rather than just admit his mistake and move on  in a bit of shameless dishonesty his own father might blush at  he claimed the  rep  in his tweet   universally understood to be short for  representative    really meant  republican  how do we know it s a lie  because his original tweet makes absolutely no sense if we replace  representative  with  republican   as the above tweet illustrates  mckinney broke the glass ceiling   for all women in georgia  a decade ago  republicans don t get to shatter the already shattered glass ceiling  years too late  much less celebrate it as a huge step forward in women s rights nice try  don  glad to see you re becoming your father s son featured image via david becker getty images
