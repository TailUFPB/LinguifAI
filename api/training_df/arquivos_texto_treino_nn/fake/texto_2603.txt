donald trump has turned yet another meeting in which he should have been focusing on being america s president and getting sh t done into an absolute circus and embarrassment during a meeting with airline executives  trump decided that he was bored and could no longer focus  so he went on a completely incoherent rant about things his personal pilot had told him  as you can imagine  everyone in the room was shocked as trump continued to hijack the meeting and went on babbling  making it impossible to actually get anything accomplished until he was finished according to the white house pool report  trump commended airlines for succeeding  despite the bad equipment that the airport gives you  in many cases   then he started complaining about the equipment  stating that he had  a pilot who s a real expert  who once told him that airlines are often given  the wrong stuff   trump continued  let s order the right equipment  probably the wrong equipment cost more  here are some more gems from his rant  we want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service and with an absolute minimum of delays  we spent six trillion dollars in the middle east  we got nothing  and we have an obsolete plane system  we have obsolete airports  as you can imagine  most of this rant made zero sense  this has become a pattern for trump   he continues to meet with industry ceos  but he doesn t actually accomplish anything  he doesn t tackle policy  and he spends most of his time talking about himself or complaining  this shouldn t be too surprising  considering that we elected a former reality television star who knows nothing about policy  so he s obviously doing whatever he can to pass the time in these meetings you can watch trump go completely off track in the meeting below read more featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
