donald trump topped off his disastrous press conference on thursday by calling the press  the enemy of the american people  on friday  and is thankfully getting all the criticism and backlash he deserves one of trump s harshest and most outspoken critics  author j k  rowling  slammed trump s comments about the press without even using any of her own words  brilliantly quoting former president theodore roosevelt  rowling tweeted to educate trump on just how the free press worked  in case dictator trump and the gop forgot  in the tweet  rowling pointed out that roosevelt had written  to announce that there must be no criticism of the president  or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is morally treasonable to the american public  rowling even used the trending  nottheenemy hashtag to show her support for the press  check out the full tweet below exactly  the free press is protected by the u s  constitution  a document that trump desperately needs to read before he does or says something else that will make him look foolish  in his attacks on the media  it s clear that trump wants  unquestioned   unchecked and unlimited power   and doesn t care if it interferes with the very values that this country was built on  trump wants to operate as if his word is law and that his alternative facts are the only truth americans should be digesting without a second thought trump seems to be oblivious to the real responsibilities of the job he signed up for  as well as the fact the he actually works for the american people   not the other way around  what rowling did perfectly put trump in his place and reminded the undeserving potus just exactly how a democracy is supposed to work featured image via ben a  pruchnie and mario tama   getty images
