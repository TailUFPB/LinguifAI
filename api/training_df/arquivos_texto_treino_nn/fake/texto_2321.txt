trump likes to pretend he was handed  a mess  when he took office  unfortunately  that s just not true  by the numbers  consumer confidence is the highest in a decade  unemployment is under five percent  and the country has been adding jobs for  straight months let s compare that to what president obama inherited   the november before he took office    jobs were lost  and up to three quarters of a million jobs were being lost per month during the crisis  that s over half a million jobs lost in a single month  the united states was in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the great depression  obviously voters have short memories  or they d never have given control over the economy back to republicans after the last fiasco  hell  even trump says the economy does better under democrats from bloomberg obama took office during the worst recession since the great depression  when the economy was losing   jobs a month and already had lost a record  percent of gdp  he completed his two terms with the largest annual gain in the value of the dollar  the biggest annual decrease in household debt as a percentage of disposable income  and the largest annual increases in car sales and hourly wages  his presidency coincided with the second highest annual gain in home equity and trailed only the clinton period in deficit reduction as a percentage of gdp facts matter for all their talk of  balanced budgets   republicans are really  really bad at balancing budgets  that s probably because they re more concerned with tax breaks for the rich and big business than they are with actually staying grounded in reality it s well known that president clinton is the only modern president to ever balance the budget  and president obama did the best after him as a percentage of gdp   and that s including the massive stimulus he used to fix our broken economy  the last republican president  president george w  bush  increased the nation s debt over  percent and left us with the financial crisis in trump s world of alternative facts  half the country is unemployed and begging for a savior  that doesn t match up with reality  though  the latest jobs report from the department of labor shows the truth   a   percent unemployment rate  and nearly sixteen million jobs added over the last eight years  i ll remind you again   the economy was losing hundreds of thousands of jobs per month when president obama assumed office  he saved us the united states is poised to save   billion in healthcare spending over the next decade thanks to obamacare  studies have shown  meanwhile  republicans want to repeal obamacare for strictly political purposes  likely replacing it with a similar plan   it was a conservative plan to start with  as most progressives favor medicare for all or another form of universal healthcare   which is estimated to cost hundreds of billions  not to mention leaving the american people high and dry when it comes to seeking medical care you can also thank president obama for the fact that the united states is still competitive in the automotive industry  his stimulus single handedly saved american cars  in fact  hundreds of thousands of jobs were added thanks to him  and gm  ford  and chrysler all saw significant profit increases thanks to the obama task force  the bush administration gets a tiny bit of credit for short term loans that prevented bankruptcy until obama assumed office  but that s giving credit holding off slightly on a disaster bush was initially responsible for  then president obama stepped in and fixed it featured image via pool getty
