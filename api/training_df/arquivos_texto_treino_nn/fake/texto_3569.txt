trump  once again  may be losing his biggest cheerleader   okay  second biggest cheerleader after rudy giuliani   ann coulter coulter  author of new york times bestselling  in trump we must  recently took to twitter to already denounce donald trump  who he feels is about to initiate the biggest sell out in politics over immigration after conservative writer mickey kraus expressed worry over mike pence and paul ryan s  pledge  to tackle immigration head on  coulter tweeted sounds like the big sell out is coming  oh well  the voters did what we could  if trump sells out  it s not our fault  https   t co tdmpaudari  ann coulter   anncoulter  december    ann  it is your fault  you and all the voters  even though trump lost the popular vote by over   million  put a notorious  serial liar in office for the next four years  someone who flip flopped on every issue imaginable  and then lied about flip flopping  is going to be president of th united states  so don t act all shocked when it turns out he was   surprise   a major sell out to the  people  the exchange that seemed to put kaus and coulter on edge was an interview mike pence gave with scott pelley pelley  just since the election  president elect trump has reversed himself on prosecuting hillary clinton and on deporting  million illegal immigrants in this country  did he just say those things to get elected  did he never intend to do them pence  i think what the american people know they have in president elect donald trump is someone who speaks straight from his mind and straight from his heart  and on the issue of illegal immigration  i promise you  as we were meeting yesterday on capitol hill with leaders of the house and senate  we re going to go straight to work after this congress convenes and this administration takes office  and we re going to pass policies that will end illegal immigration in this country doesn t seem like anything bad  and on the surface it looks like something every conservative should want  but when one factors in that republicans are seeking to repeal obamacare  deregulate wall street  and begin confirmation hearings for the next scotus pick  immigration reform happening  right away  may seem like a distant hope for xenophobes like kaus and coulter it looks like trump is losing support from coulter and he s not even president yet  it wouldn t be the first time coulter seemed to back off of supporting trump  it certainly won t be the last time either featured image alberto e  rodriguez getty images
