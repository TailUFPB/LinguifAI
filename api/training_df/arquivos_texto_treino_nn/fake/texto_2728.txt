alleged president donald trump has literally mocked every group of u s  citizens during his godawful campaign and it s payback time  karma is a thing and house democrats are making sure that the fake president will have to face the very people he mocked in   trump s first speech to congress will be very uncomfortable for him because democrats have launched a plot to invite guests they say will suffer under new white house policies democrats are inviting a crowd which includes ethnic minorities  lgbt people  undocumented immigrants  the disabled and others when he addresses a joint session on feb    according to the hill this time  democrats are not going to boycott trump s speech as they did his inauguration  but instead  they will force the man baby potus to face off with the very people who feel alienated and targeted by his controversial executive orders a letter which is circulating on capitol hill urges fellow democrats to bring guests who have made  a positive impact  on the community  despite discrimination or marginalization  it is our hope that their presence in the house gallery will remind president trump that he is not the arbiter of patriotism   the letter reads   this country belongs to all of us  and his rhetoric of intolerance will not stand  the authors of the letter are as diverse as the crowd they re seeking to assemble they include reps  jim langevin  r i    who was shot accidentally as a teen and became the first quadriplegic to serve in congress  michelle lujan grisham  n m    head of the congressional hispanic caucus  cedric richmond  la    chairman of the congressional black caucus  judy chu  calif    head of the congressional asian pacific american caucus  and david cicilline  r i   and jared polis  colo    the co chairman of the lgbt equality caucus  we want to send a strong message to the  that he cannot push these communities aside  and he cannot change the fabric of this country   the authors wrote  instead of celebrating the very diversity that makes our country a beacon of inclusion and equality  he has chosen to vilify  bully and alienate women  immigrants  people of color  people with disabilities  and people of differing faiths   the democrats stated in the letter  his rhetoric emboldens those who seek a scapegoat for the challenges this country faces   the democrats added resistance is not futile photo by alex wong getty images
