the white house has warned donald trump not to turn his attacks to michelle obama  or things could get quite rough for him  i can t think of a bolder way for donald trump to lose even more standing than he already has than by engaging the first lady of the united states   principal deputy white house press secretary eric schultz told reporters aboard air force one  to date  the donald has largely stayed away from attacking the first lady  with his one reference to her   a blatantly false claim that she attacked clinton in political ads   only serving to embarrass him  i ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials i ve ever seen of michelle obama talking about you  hillary   trump said at the debate  earning him a collective eyeroll from america and a  false  from politifact  in reality  obama has campaigned hard for clinton schultz is right  if trump begins attacking the first lady  a woman who is admired by people on both sides of the political aisle and who  for the most part  avoids engaging in politics  it will show that he truly has no shame   if the wall  a proposed muslim ban  grabbing women  by the pussy   courting white supremacists  and a f cking child rape case had not managed to make that clear already schultz s warning is a good one  there is nothing the donald can do strip what little legitimacy his campaign has ever had than to attack a woman whose primary concern for the last eight years has been making sure children are educated and fed  the blowback would be something even trump could not handle of course  trump will likely view this as a challenge   but even if he doesn t go on the attack  his  deplorables have had him covered in that area for years on thursday  michelle obama didn t attack trump  but she very poignantly pointed out exactly how awful he is  watch that below featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla ty wright
