donald trump s choice for treasury secretary is a real life ebeneezer scrooge trump s pick of steven mnuchin to run the treasury department is literally letting the fox guard the hen house  it s also hypocritical and dangerous mnuchin was a partner at goldman sachs  a big wall street bank trump often crucified hillary clinton for being cozy with  for  years  furthermore  mnuchin took advantage of the financial crisis in  just like trump did and made millions of dollars foreclosing on families  homes through his establishment of onewest bank during the collapse and one foreclosure  in particular  makes it clear that ordinary americans should not trust mnuchin because he ll only serve himself instead of serving the people according to politico two years ago  onewest filed foreclosure papers on the lakeland  florida  home of ossie lofton  who had taken a reverse mortgage  a loan that supplies cash to elderly homeowners and doesn t require monthly payments after confusion over insurance coverage  a onewest subsidiary sent lofton a bill for     she sent a check for    the bank sent another bill  for  cents  lofton    sent a check for  cents  in november   the bank foreclosed in october  lawyers at the nonprofit florida rural legal services contested onewest s foreclosure and asked the polk county circuit court for a jury trial  i don t know that they re the worst  but i certainly think it s criminal the way these servicers are treating elderly homeowners   said lynn drysdale  an attorney representing lofton seriously   this vulture literally tried to take an elderly person s home away from them over  cents  this is a guy who literally accrued an estimated net worth of   million at goldman sachs  yet he greedily refused to forgive  cents  mnuchin could have just pulled a quarter and two pennies out of his pocket to cover the extra amount himself and he wouldn t have missed it at all  targeting an elderly woman like that is just evil and that s not the only evil thing mnuchin has done to other people to line his own pockets onewest bank withheld     from sandy hook victims when they needed the money the most to rebuild their homes and businesses  and after his bank merged with another to become cit bank  it was accused of discriminating against black and latino customers in short  donald trump is letting a vulture capitalist take the reigns of the treasury department and is doubling down on conservative economic policies that caused the great recession in the first place  so get ready for another crash over the next four years and don t expect the government to help anyone but themselves this time around featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
