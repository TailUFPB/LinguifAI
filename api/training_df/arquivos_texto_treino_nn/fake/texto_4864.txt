on sunday  scottie nell hughes joined a panel discussion on cnn s reliable sources where the trump campaign surrogate defended donald trump s characterization of his democratic challenger hillary clinton as a  bigot   the justification for the label  clinton is prejudiced against the racist faction of trump s base most of the conversation surrounded the trump campaigns hiring of steve bannon as his campaign ceo  bannon is officially on a  temporary leave  from his position as the executive chairman for the reactionary  often dubbed as the  alt right   right wing media site  breitbart  the site caters to an audience that would probably consider fox news to be a liberal propaganda network mtv news host  jamil smith said during the panel discussion that he considers breitbart to support white supremacy and racism  i would say that  part of the white supremacist machine  they are trying to make sure these views become mainstream  and i think  through trump  they are finding a way to do that  trump has faced waves of criticism for the move to hire bannon from clinton  the left  and even some members of the right  to which trump referred to clinton as a bigot for doing so  here s hughes justification for the use of the term  bigotry  if you look at the definition  it s about someone who s small minded and sits there and directs hate towards a certain group  hillary clinton s speech was all about hate towards a group that  while my fellow counterpart might consider them to be very racist  it s the exact opposite  at that point  hughes dives hot head first into one of her just this side of unhinged rants  claiming that just because a section of breitbart s readers are white supremacists  doesn t mean they all are smith  apparently noticing that hughes doesn t understand what he said at all clarifies his position  what they present is the view of the white supremacist mentality through their coverage  it s not necessarily saying   well  everyone who works there is a white supremacist   i don t know that   smith continues  finalizing his thoughts   the point is to say  what kind of viewpoint did they reflect  and it s undeniable that they reflect a white supremacist view if you looked over their coverage over the last several years  i would consider being called a bigot against white supremacists and those who promote it a badge of honor  as i m sure most people would  in the mind of a trump campaign surrogate  that s a valid line of attack you can watch the segment below featured image from video screenshot
