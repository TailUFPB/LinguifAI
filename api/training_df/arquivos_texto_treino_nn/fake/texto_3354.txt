if sarah palin really cares about children with disabilities she ll stand up for them in texas because texas republicans just initiated a major   million cut in medicaid funding that federal agencies warn will particularly hurt children with autism and other disabilities according to the herald democrat the u s  department of education told u s  rep  lloyd doggett  d austin  in a dec   letter that up to  of the  providers in the state s early childhood intervention program could stop offering services because of financial uncertainty  texas health officials originally told the federal government about the number of providers at risk on dec    according to the letter  which was obtained by the texas tribune on thursday texas republicans slashed the medicaid funding last year but the cuts were blocked by a lawsuit that has been dismissed  paving the way for the cuts to take effect now as the christmas season goes into full swing  and because of the cuts  thousands of children could be denied healthcare because many childcare groups could be forced to shutter their programs that are covered by medicaid  if these groups do pull out of the program  it will be devastating for kids with autism  speech delays  down syndrome  and other disabilities and delays   child advocate stephanie rubin said   we know that these groups want to keep serving children and we know staff at  is working hard on this  but the legislature needs to make sure the funding is in place  the lack of compassion for children after they are born is right out of the texas republican playbook  they crusade to ban abortion but don t give a damn about the child once it is out of the womb what s truly hypocritical is that sarah palin isn t in texas giving republicans a public thrashing  after all  she s often bragging about being an advocate for children with disabilities  especially kids with down syndrome because her youngest son struggles with the disability every day so far  palin has not uttered a word in opposition to the medicaid cuts that would affect disabled children the most  but she was more than happy to raise hell over a coffee mug walmart was selling online that said  got retard   on them instead of focusing her efforts on a cup  perhaps sarah palin could go to texas and take her own party to task for doing something truly despicable to children with healthcare needs  because while bitching about a cup won t do much to help disabled kids  crusading for their right to get the healthcare they need and deserve would actually help tremendously featured image  aaron p  bernstein getty images
