donald trump s treatment of journalists is so bad that the reuters news agency is now advising reporters to treat trump like they would treat a foreign dictator on tuesday  trump and his team announced that they will no longer send surrogates to appear on cnn  an escalation of the war trump has been waging against the news network  which he calls  fake news  because they won t promote his agenda trump has even praised fox new s biased reporting as something cnn should copy furthermore  trump and his team have repeatedly threatened and tried to intimidate journalists for doing their jobs just because they aren t writing puff pieces that kiss trump s ass well  reuters is doing something about it for  years  reuters has been bringing us news from around the world  they ve been in the most peaceful and democratic places  but they ve also been in war zones and reported on the most dangerous and tyrannical regimes in world history in a message to staff on tuesday  reuters editor in chief steve adler advised his reporters to start dealing with trump the way they have dealt with brutal dictators in the past  it s not every day that a u s  president calls journalists  among the most dishonest human beings on earth  or that his chief strategist dubs the media  the opposition party   adler wrote   it s hardly surprising that the air is thick with questions and theories about how to cover the new administration  adler then revealed his solution for how reporters should handle trump so what is the reuters answer  to oppose the administration  to appease it  to boycott its briefings  to use our platform to rally support for the media  all these ideas are out there  and they may be right for some news operations  but they don t make sense for reuters  we already know what to do because we do it every day  and we do it all over the world to state the obvious  reuters is a global news organization that reports independently and fairly in more than  countries  including many in which the media is unwelcome and frequently under attack  i am perpetually proud of our work in places such as turkey  the philippines  egypt  iraq  yemen  thailand  china  zimbabwe  and russia  nations in which we sometimes encounter some combination of censorship  legal prosecution  visa denials  and even physical threats to our journalists  we respond to all of these by doing our best to protect our journalists  by recommitting ourselves to reporting fairly and honestly  by doggedly gathering hard to get information   and by remaining impartial  we write very rarely about ourselves and our troubles and very often about the issues that will make a difference in the businesses and lives of our readers and viewers we don t know yet how sharp the trump administration s attacks will be over time or to what extent those attacks will be accompanied by legal restrictions on our news gathering  but we do know that we must follow the same rules that govern our work anywhere if donald trump thinks his relationship with the media is going to get better because he attacks them  he should think again  reuters is coming for him and he should be scared  especially if other news organizations follow their example featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
