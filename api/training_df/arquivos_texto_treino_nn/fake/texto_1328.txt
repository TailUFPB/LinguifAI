congress may not be quite ready to impeach trump  but many small towns and cities are doing their part to move the entire process along and make his impeachment a reality curren  ly there are  local governments that have passed resolutions calling for impeachment  with brookline  mass   becoming the latest on thursday and most likely not the last  four other massachusetts districts have also made the move  cambridge  amherst  pelham and leverett  with newton also having a proposal up for consideration  but massachusetts isn t the only state trump should be wary of  california is another hot spot when it comes to local councils calling for his head  with los angeles  richmond  alameda and berkeley overwhelmingly passing resolutions asking for the impeachment process to begin but what  if any  effect does passing these measures actually have  while local councils have zero authority in the whole process  the goal is to get the ball rolling by convincing congress that at least launching an investigation into trump to determine if impeachment charges are warranted is something that desperately needs to happen  if successful  that will be the first step necessary in getting articles of impeachment drafted and voted on by the house  from there  a majority vote from the house will result in the articles then being sent to the senate and a trial will be held  requiring a two thirds agreement to convict the movement of getting local councils to take a stand and be heard was initially organized by a group from amherst  mass   called free speech for the people  the liberal organization operates under the belief that trump violated the foreign emoluments clause in the constitution by not fully removing himself from his private business interests before being sworn in as president of the united states of america without even running much of a real advertising campaign  digital or otherwise  free speech for the people has already garnered over a million signatures in support of trump s impeachment through their website  impeachdonaldtrumpnow org  the only way a president can be held accountable for abusing the public trust is via the impeachment process   says john bonifaz  a constitutional lawyer who heads the group   it is at this point unclear on the law whether a sitting president can be indicted  many trump supporters believe that talk of having the president impeached within five months of being sworn into office is just pure politics and sour grapes on behalf of the democrats  but bonifaz has news for them  referencing the recent failure of liberal stronghold chicago s to vote in the resolution to call for impeachment  if decisions are getting made that this isn t politically the right way to go  then we re putting party over country here   bonifaz said   frankly  history will judge us in this moment on how we act   i would hope that the chicago city council takes up this again and votes on what is at stake   that no one is above the law   even the president of the united states  featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
