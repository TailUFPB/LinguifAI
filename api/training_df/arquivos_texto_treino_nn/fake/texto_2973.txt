just when you thought republicans couldn t be bigger pricks toward rep  john lewis  one governor is demanding that lewis thank today s gop for ending slavery in  rep  john lewis is a civil rights hero who risked his life fighting for voting rights with martin luther king during the civil rights movement in the   he was at the lincoln memorial as king delivered his  i have a dream  speech  so he knows full well what president abraham lincoln and the early republican party did to free the slaves and advance civil rights but that republican party has changed significantly over the last  years  and is now controlled by white supremacists and racists and spends most of its time trying to suppress voting rights and deny civil rights to people of color more than it does defending the legacy lincoln built maine s tea party governor paul lepage  however  still thinks republicans like himself deserve praise for something the party did over a century and a half ago during an interview with wvom  lepage criticized lewis for calling trump illegitimate and demanded that lewis thank white republicans for freeing the slave  john lewis ought to look at history   lepage said   it was abraham lincoln who freed the slaves  it was rutherford b  hayes and ulysses s  grant who fought against jim crow laws  a simple thank you would suffice  except that hayes sold out the fight for civil rights in exchange for the presidency  as the bangor daily news pointed out  hayes struck  an informal deal after a contested election that gave him the white house in exchange for promising to pull northern troops out of the south  pulling out those troops marked the premature end of reconstruction and the beginning of jim crow laws in the south that would remain intact for a century until king and lewis spearheaded a renewed fight for equality it should be pointed out that democrats were the ones who passed the civil rights act and voting rights act into law while republicans began pandering to racist southerners and have turned their backs on their liberal past ever since but now republicans like lepage think that they are owed praise for ending slavery even though republican today would like to bring slavery back according to alternet not content to merely support an insurrection against the duly elected government of the united states   percent of the republicans surveyed by cnn also expressed admiration for the leaders of the south a cabal whose allegiance to white supremacy was most tellingly summed up by the vice president of the confederacy s sentiment that its   foundations are laid  its cornerstone rests  upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man  that slavery  subordination to the superior race  is his natural and normal condition  this  our new government  is the first  in the history of the world  based on this great physical  philosophical and moral truth  in fact   percent of donald trump supporters think freeing the slaves was a bad idea  seriously so the idea that john lewis owes thanks to republicans like lepage is absolutely laughable  especially since lepage has called for  people of color  to be shot if the only civil rights accomplishment republicans can point to is the freeing of the slaves  years ago  their r sum  is in severe need of an update  of course  that will never happen because republicans are controlled by racists  abraham lincoln is surely rolling in his grave featured image via flickr
