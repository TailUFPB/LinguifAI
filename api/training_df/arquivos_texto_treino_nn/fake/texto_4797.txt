following the mass exodus of hispanic surrogates from trump s campaign  eric trump is pretty confused  after all  his dad has been very  very consistent about his plans on immigration  so why would they do this to the saintly candidate  eric seems to think that  since nothing has changed  there s no reason for hispanic advocates to be upset he really doesn t get it  in an appearance on fox   friends  he actually said   is actually pretty amazing considering the speech was actually very consistent and he has been very  very consistent with his plan  it s really interesting  what s interesting is not that hispanics are now fleeing trump   it s that eric thinks his consistency should resonate with them trump went to mexico to meet with president enrique pe a nieto after appearing to soften his position on undocumented immigrants  so is it really any wonder that this return to his angry  heartless  racist stance that hispanics are the enemy to  real  americans feels like a betrayal one particular surrogate who has worked very hard to convince latinos to vote for trump  jacob monty  resigned after trump s speech on wednesday night  he laid it all out in his explanation for leaving  i was a strong supporter of donald trump when i believed he was going to address the immigration problem realistically and compassionately  what i heard today was not realistic and not compassionate  ramiro pena  a church pastor in texas  likewise yanked his support  saying  i am so sorry but i believe mr  trump lost the election tonight  the  national hispanic advisory council  seems to be simply for optics and i do not have the time or energy for a scam  everything trump does for minority outreach is just for show  his visit to a black church in detroit is nothing but a show  too  he s performing for an audience because that s all he knows how to do  being serious about this is an alien concept to him  republicans know it and are actually trying to figure out how to reach more white people because they ve given up on trump ever reaching minorities  his  outreach  is too little  too late  and a total lie eric here is wearing his blinders a little too tightly  he hopes that clarifying trump s message to these guys will turn them around  and he actually voiced the following clueless words  it s very important to us  if you look at the hispanic community and the latino community  they ve largely been left behind in this country  but his father talking about splitting up families and wasting ungodly amounts of money on a wall and on deportation isn t going to leave these communities further back in the dust  har de har har  don t make us laugh too hard  it hurts eric trump should at least have an idea that a consistent message targeting and alienating a group is just going to consistently piss them off  eventually  people get tired of hoping someone will change  and they just walk away featured image by joe raedle getty images
