presidents are supposed to serve the american people  but trump has made it clear that everyone works for him and he is not to be questioned or investigated or placed under scrutiny  ever  even when it comes to russia  even when it comes to his severe lack of ethics and his constitutional violations  we know about many of his conflicts of interest  which very well may break the law  and one would expect them to improve as time goes by  however  they re getting worse  not better historically  presidents do not go into office with the number of business interests trump has  previous presidents have placed what interests they do have into blind trusts  which means the president separates himself from them entirely  he has no influence  he gets no information  trump  not so much  sure  his businesses are in a trust  but his sons manage it and they give him updates regularly even if they didn t  they re helping their father corrupt the office of the president with his business  trump s sons have pitched an idea for budget hotels called  american idea   and have gone so far as to sign letters of intent to build said hotels in economically depressed areas in red states that isn t an  america first   initiative so much as it s a way for trump to expand his brand and boost his popularity among the plebes he otherwise ignores  we all have a million dollars that says those hotels will hire foreign workers for cheap  as mar a lago in florida just did  trump s presence at his golf clubs serves as promotion  and some of them  like mar a lago  are raking in the dough from increased membership fees and people willing to pay them in order to say they ve rubbed shoulders with him and other world leaders  his decision to roll back an environmental policy ensuring clean drinking water directly benefits his golf courses  which means he brings in even more money the trump international hotel in d c   situated in the historic old post office building  isn t supposed to belong to any government officials  the reason trump can have such an interest in it is supposedly because his business is in a trust  so he technically doesn t have an interest  or something  regardless  the hotel is supposed to be donating profits from foreign officials who stay there to the u s  treasury  but trump said that asking foreign officials to identify themselves as such would  diminish the guest experience  so he s directly profiting from foreign officials who stay there  either to curry favor with him or because they think it d be rude to stay with a competitor  it s probably both trump was obviously corrupt before before he was even elected   he s known this whole time how to milk campaigns and how to milk his office for all its worth  so that when he leaves he s richer than ever  during his campaign  he made heavy use of his own properties  that might make sense  but the law reveals just how he lined his pockets with campaign donations federal election law requires a campaign to pay fair market value for goods and services bought from a candidate s own businesses  most candidates with their own business interests wind up spending one to three percent of their total spending on their businesses  trump s spending was above  percent  there s no way that was an accident trump is corrupt  he knows it  we all know it  that s why he says that the president isn t subject to ethics laws   he s trying to build the case that he can do what he wants because he s the president and we re not featured image via alex wong getty images
