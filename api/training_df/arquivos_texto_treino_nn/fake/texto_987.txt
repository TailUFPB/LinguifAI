the republicans are at it again   this time by passing a bill that will allow public schools in kentucky to teach the bible wdrb reports that the man responsible for this is gov  matt bevin  it was publicly signed at the capitol on tuesday  the bill  which easily passed the house and senate  gives local school boards the option of developing a bible literacy class as part of their social studies curriculum  the course is also meant to be an elective and not required the bill s sponsor said students need to understand the role the bible played in american history  it really did set the foundation that our founding fathers used to develop documents like the declaration of independence  the constitution  the bill of rights   said rep  d j  johnson  r owensboro    all of those came from principles from the bible  is actually examining the bible truly necessary to look at american history  will it even be an examination of the bible  what about other religious texts  it smells more like a guise to teach the bible as if it s sunday school in public schools i m not the only one that thinks so  either  the aclu of kentucky said it s concerned about how the law might be used in schools  a bible literacy bill that  on its face  may not appear to be unconstitutional  could in fact become unconstitutional in its implementation   said advocacy director kate miller   we want to make sure that teachers can teach and make sure that they don t go in to preach   miller said miller told wdrb news the aclu will monitor the law closely honestly  if religion is that important to you  stick your child in private school  if you think you can t  find a way  the idea that we would not want this to be an option for people in school  that would be crazy  i don t know why every state would not embrace this  why we as a nation would not embrace this   bevin told the crowd well  the answer should be obvious  because public schools are not meant to be held to any one particular religion  though people like to say this nation was founded on christianity  it was actually founded on freedom of religion  people wanted to practice their beliefs freely without the beliefs of others shoved down their throats unfortunately  all we can do is watch  wait  and hope that this bill will be in the trash before long featured image via cheriss may nurphoto via getty images
