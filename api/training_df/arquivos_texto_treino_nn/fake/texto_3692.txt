morning joe is on msnbc  which is supposedly the left wing political news and opinion network  its host  joe scarborough styles himself as a moderate conservative willing to criticize the nutjob faction of his own party  and in many instances he is  he dresses this up by having left leaning co hosts like mika brzezinski and willie geist  along with frequent guests who are also democrats  like former democratic congressman harold ford  jr  however  scarborough never lets us forget that he is still a republican  and still holds  at least on some level  some of the gop s most despicable and bigoted views  this was definitely on display wednesday morning  when the talk turned to president obama s legacy and his overall presidency in comparison to supposedly improving approval numbers for our newly elected orange buffoon  donald trump  that s when scarborough made this shockingly racist statement  obama came in as black jesus  i don t want to come in as redneck jesus if i m a president of the united states  you want to come in where people   like ronald reagan   actually underestimate you  and the media  once again  has done donald trump a great favor  what have they told us over the past week  he s a white supremacist  he s a nazi  he s bringing nazis back to america  scarborough ended his tirade by calling his colleagues in the press  fools  in their attempts to derail and bludgeon trump  in the wrong way  they set the bar so low  donald trump says there s a bar  i m going to walk over it  for one thing  joe scarborough  that is about as racist as it gets  of course there were high expectations for president obama  he is the first african american man to be elected not once  but twice  and in record numbers  no matter what one thinks of the man himself or of his policy prescriptions  that fact alone makes his presidency an historic one  and puts an amazing amount of pressure upon him secondly  his presidency is far from a failure  despite the fact that gop senate leader mitch mcconnell and the rest of the obstructionists in your party had one goal and one goal only in mind   to make sure obama failed and lasted just one term   he still got plenty done  he cleaned up the economic mess george w  bush left the nation and world in  got record numbers of americans health insurance  made the military a safer place for lgbtq people  got rid of the bigoted defense of marriage act  and secured marriage equality for all  this and so much more happened on president obama s watch  with your party of obstructionists blocking him all the way as for donald trump  no one called trump himself a nazi  however  there is no denying that he has spent his entire ugly  repugnant campaign playing footsie with neo nazis  klan members  and other assorted racist bigots  hell  he s done such a good job of that he actually has the gall to put a literal white supremacist steps from the oval office  and nominate a man who was deemed to racist to be a federal judge to run the entire justice department  no  there s no denying which direction trump swings when it comes to race so  in other words  check your racism  joe scarborough  you re dead wrong on this one  you re just one more piece of proof that even so called  reasonable  republicans are still as racist as they come watch the full exchange here featured image via video screen capture
