republicans are great at creating controversy where there is none  they shut down the get out the vote organization  acorn  because they fraudulently made people believe that acorn was a criminal front  because  you know  black people   they ve also tried to strangle the life out of planned parenthood  again  for fraudulent reasons one persistent non problem that republicans are manufacturing is voter fraud  which is virtually non existent  this is actually pretty big deal  according to a poll released this week  more than half of respondents felt that voter fraud was real  and most of those were republicans trump himself has been beating the drum about voter fraud when he proactively claims that the only way he d lose is if the election is rigged  well  maybe trump should look right under his nose  it appears that there is voter fraud  but it s coming from trump s own newly hired campaign ceo  steve bannon  bannon is registered in the swing state of florida  but records show that no one actually lives at the address to which he s registered  in fact  it s set to be torn down  that makes him a criminal  at least according to florida law according to a report in the guardian  bannon has never lived in the house he claims as his residence  his ex wife  diane clohesy once lived there  she moved out earlier in the year  the two divorced seven years ago if you think that s just some sort of inadvertent paperwork error  well  it happened twice bannon previously rented another house for clohesy in miami from  to  and assigned his voter registration to the property during that period  but a source with direct knowledge of the rental agreement for this house said bannon did not live there either  and that bannon and clohesy were not in a relationship bannon  clohesy and trump s campaign repeatedly declined to answer detailed questions about bannon s voting arrangements  jason miller  a trump campaign spokesman  eventually said in an email   mr bannon moved to another location in florida   miller declined to answer further questions according to neighbors  bannon has been to the first house  which he paid    a month for   but only a few times and he certainly didn t live there  the neighbors at the second house say they ve never seen bannon bannon does set up shop in what he calls  breitbart embassy   which is a    million townhouse right next to the supreme court building  bannon lives upstairs while his staff works in the basement  that  however  is owned by mostafa el gindy  who s an egyptian businessman this may be less about voter fraud than tax fraud  florida has no income tax  so people often try to set up florida addresses to escape taxes  attorneys typically recommend that they also attach a voter registration address as some sort of evidence of residency  there is no record bannon has voted from that address if bannon is found guilty of submitting false information on a florida registration form  it s a third degree felony and punishable by up to five years in prison  of course  the odds of him actually being prosecuted are pretty damned slim  but it does put a big wrench in the trump campaign s claims of voter fraud featured image via cnn video screen capture
