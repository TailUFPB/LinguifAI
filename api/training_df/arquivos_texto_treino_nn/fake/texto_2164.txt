not many people can get under donald trump s skin like billionaire and shark tank investor mark cuban  not only did cuban become a massively outspoken supporter of hillary clinton during her presidential campaign  but he s blasted trump more times than we can count  on sunday  cuban was back at it again as he called trump the  zoolander president  and made an announcement that s going to have trump s little hands shaking in an appearance at the south by southwest festival in austin  texas  cuban admitted that he d originally liked trump   that is  until he got to know him   then  cuban likened the undeserving potus to the incompetent  self centered movie character zoolander  cuban also made fun of trump s complete lack of intelligence as he joked  just think how efficient he could be if he learned how to use a search engine  i love the guy because he s the only human being who trolls himself and doesn t know it  here s a video of cuban s comments this recent attack follows a long history of others  each one carrying a sting strong enough to make trump retaliate and embarrass himself  last year  cuban challenged trump to a four hour interview about policy  and even offered to donate   million to whatever charity trump wanted   and trump obviously didn t have the courage to take him up on that  instead  trump went on twitter and said cuban wasn t  smart enough to understand what s going on   just last month  trump tweeted that cuban wasn t  smart enough to run for president  given the fact that cuban supports policies that are much more grounded in reality  many of us would disagree  cuban believes in climate change and environmental responsibility  and he is against trump s immigration policies and thinks all americans should have health care cuban also took another jab at trump  stating that in the next election  we will need someone who can  look forward   instead of  acting like it s    cuban was asked if he would run for president in the future  and he said something that will truly terrify trump  i ve got a lot of time to decide and we ll see what happens  trump  who is delusional enough to think he ll actually serve eight years like former president barack obama  is not going to be happy about that  featured image via mike windle and drew angerer   getty images
