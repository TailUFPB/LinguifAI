democrats who are offering to work with donald trump should cease and desist right now because he has no interest in compromise throughout his campaign  trump launched petty insults and divisive rhetoric  in fact  that s all he did for a year and a half  now he all of a sudden claims that he wants unity well  that s bullshit and top trump cheerleader newt gingrich admitted as much during an appearance with trump chief propagandist sean hannity after congratulating each other for successfully screwing over america  gingrich insulted republicans who refused to blindly support trump  the little  whiny  sniveling negative cowards who were  never trumpers  are beneath our paying attention to them  let them drift off into the ashbin of history while we go ahead and work with donald trump and with the house and senate republicans to create a dramatically new future  yeah  a future where oppression  hate  racism  and sexism reign but gingrich also blasted any semblance that trump actually gives a damn about unity by promising hannity that democrats are going to be disappointed if they actually think trump will be a reasonable man to work with  their technique will be to say  oh  be reasonable  don t push too hard  don t force the issue  find a compromise with democrats  maybe he shouldn t name one of the justices who are conservative who s on his list  maybe he should find a nice moderate acceptable to the democrats  down that road is a disaster  and so we have to be aware that the danger is not that they re going to actively fight  the danger is that they re going to opt for honeyed words of subversion that undermines the entire movement to make america great again  here s the video via youtube in other words  trump and his republican supporters intend to jam through whatever policies they want whether americans like it or not frankly  democrats should treat donald trump the same way republicans treats president obama over the last eight years  republicans should not get to sabotage a democratic presidency and then expect democrats to play ball when one of their own gets in the white house gingrich went on to say that trump could offer an infrastructure program that could get democratic support  which is funny considering president obama offered the same kind of program and republicans ruthlessly opposed it  being reasonable did not help democrats in this election and it won t help them two and four years from now when new elections occur  there needs to be consequences for the way republicans have behaved the last eight years  that means giving them more than a taste of their own medicine featured image via screencapture
