if republicans were even moderately literate  they would know that the message of shakespeare s  julius caesar  is that assassinating leaders you don t like is just bad juju all around  everyone ends up unhappy in the end  enter donald trump jr  stage far right shortly after the guy who shot gop rep  steve scalise and four other people at baseball practice was revealed to be a green party person who voted for jill stein  regularly bashed hillary clinton  and who happened to volunteer for bernie sanders  campaign  donald trump jr  hopped on twitter to blame a bunch of actors  events like today are exactly why we took issue with ny elites glorifying the assassination of our president   the tweet reads  it is  of course  referencing the  shakespeare in the park  production of  julius caesar  traditionally  the play has featured various world leaders  including abraham lincoln  in the role of  caesar   in   for example  the very same play with the very same script featured a man who looked strikingly similar to barack obama  he was murdered  because the play s plot largely hinges on the historical fact that julius caesar was murdered  here is a photo of the  caesar conservatives said nothing at the time because it was barack obama  but when donald trump   the current president    was  caesar   all hell broke loose because republicans  as a group  are f cking morons fortunately  the fine folks on twitter were kind enough to let him know that he s too stupid to know he s stupid the point of the play is that political violence is wrong that s like saying we shouldn t watch saving private ryan or it ll lead to war   mikel jollett   mikeljollett  june     i missed this controversy  is donald trump jr  complaining about new york elites   rod johnson   hauterodjohnson  june    fairness to fox  it s probably safe to assume shakespeare would have detested trump   rod johnson   hauterodjohnson  june    m afraid they are too ignorant of the plays meaning to see the correlation to modern times  they only see the trump cesar being stabbed  ellen      june    when sarah palin  joked  about having gabby giffords in her crosshairs  literally  then she was shot   grifterivanka     june    when sarah palin  joked  about having gabby giffords in her crosshairs  literally  then she was shot   grifterivanka     june    didn t see anyone speaking up  years ago when the play was about assassinating obama  impeach trump     june    moral of the play is that violence is wrong  did you never read julius caesar  why are you politicizing the shooting in va   alexandria  janice fredericks     june    re both so fucking stupid  it s shakespeare  you inbred cum stain  where were you when they  assassinated  obama for  years   cx   cxcope  june    these people shot by a piece of art or a gun  you fucking idiot   sean hartofilis   beachpillows  june    jr  your father on live tv actually rallied for his supporters to exercise their  amendment rights against hilary clinton  hypocrite   darlakay   darlaforestal  june    twitter com   donald j  trump   akadonaldtrump  june    can t be serious   raspyvoicedchick     june    peep from you when they did the same to obama   camisheffield   camianns  june    basically  if you haven t noticed  the gop is effectively fictional detective frank drebin lately  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    this scene has never been funnier posted by john prager on monday  june    we could not reasonably expect anyone from the trump family aside from barron to present a reasonable response to anything   the kid was the only person who showed any sign of dismay when one of trump s supporters shouted out that obama should be killed at his father s inauguration  after all   it is still disappointing that don jr   like all republicans  refuses to address the fact that nothing was done to prevent him from getting a gun featured image via getty images  win mcnamee  screengrab
