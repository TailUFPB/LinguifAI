the congressional budget office released their report on the senate s version of the republican  health care  bill on monday  and it was not good news  according to their analysis  a whopping  million americans will lose their insurance coverage if the bill becomes law  but that is not the extent of the cruelty in this legislation the cbo report revealed that much like the house version  the senate bill is especially callous when it comes to the lives of those who are sick  disabled  or elderly   you know  the people that need health care the most if the bill were to pass  older americans would see their premiums skyrocket  under obamacare  the average cost of insurance coverage for a  year old with an income of    is    annually  but under the senate bill  dubbed the better care reconciliation act  that same  year old would see their premiums rise to    per year  that means  percent of grandma s income will be going to insurance premiums  which does not include the costs of co pays  deductibles  etc cbo analysis bcra premiums  via twitterthe big brag of this bill is that it will lower premiums for the young and middle aged  a little bit   assuming they are healthy  of course  but here s the thing  no one stays young and healthy forever  some might argue that the whole point of having health care is so you have the opportunity to get old in the first place unless you die a tragic death before your time  probably from gun violence if you are in the u s   but i digress   you are going to get old  that much is a guarantee  it s an either or thing  not a maybe  and the chances are pretty good that sooner or later  you are going to get sick  which  once again  is the whole point of having health insurance to begin with  but under the gop bill  getting sick means you now have one of those nifty pre existing condition things so no matter how you look at it  the only way to avoid paying sky high premiums under the bcra is to die  this bill may be a lot of things  but it sure as hell isn t  health care  featured image via win mcnamee getty images
