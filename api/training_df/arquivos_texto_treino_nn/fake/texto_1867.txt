a former saturday night live cast member has just spilled the beans about one of donald trump s secrets taran killam  who left snl in   completely destroyed trump in an interview published in brooklyn magazine  putting to rest the massive amount of speculation about whether or not trump actually knows how to read  apparently  trump cannot  according to killam  trump  struggled  to read even the simple jokes the writers had given him trump made an appearance on the show in december   right after he announced he was entering the presidential race  killam said that particular episode was  not fun  and  most of the cast and writers were not excited to have him there  however  having trump there taught the cast something interesting about him  during the  table read  prior to the rehearsal  the host of the week is supposed to read through the jokes they re given  killam said trump struggled to read at the table read  which did not give many of us great confidence  didn t get the jokes  really  he s just a man who seems to be powered by bluster  i didn t get the feeling that he was excited to be there  when killam was asked if trump was  unpleasant  to work with on the show  killam said  he was  everything you see  what you see is what you get with him  really  i mean  there was no big reveal  there have been rumors circulating about trump s inability to read before  and now this confirms it  from trump s refusal to read through documents in front of people to his tendency to ditch his teleprompter during his speeches  trump s erratic behavior raised suspicions that he was hiding something  and when you look at a video like the one below  it certainly confirms killam s confession that trump is challenged when it comes to literacy featured image via pool   getty images
