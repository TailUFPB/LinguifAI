it s no secret that donald trump got a lot of help from the russian government this election  from the wildfire of fake news spread across the internet to leaks on hillary clinton  russia and its dear leader vladimir putin were in the bag for the new president elect but there s proof that the kremlin and its band of thugs may have acted in a more nefarious  intricate way   and democrats want to expose that house democrats  led by ranking member adam schiff  california  of the committee on intelligence  are set to introduce legislation that calls for a federal probe into whether or not   and to what extent   the russian government played in the u s  election via hacking   to take action on evidence of foreign interference in the  u s  elections   california rep  eric swalwell and maryland rep  elijah cummings will introduce the bill in the lame duck sessionin a letter to the white house  schiff asked that president obama share with members of congress a classified report that details russia s potential role in swaying the outcome of the election   and that it very well could have given us president trump we are deeply concerned by russian efforts to undermine  interfere with and even influence the outcome of our recent election  by eroding americans  and foreigners  trust in us institutions  russia both weakens our country and sows global instability and uncertainty the letter  signed by all six democrats on the committee  comes days after senate democrats sent the white house a similar letter urging transparency on russia in time magazine  donald trump told interviewers that he does not believe russia had instigated a hack  or any other meddling  and that the concern of such was politically motivated by the democrats  i don t believe it  i don t believe they interfered   trump said in an interview with time magazine  which named him person of the year when asked by time if the conclusion reached by u s  officials was motivated by politics  trump responded   i think so  while it s unclear how much of an impact the intrusions had on the election outcome  the revelations proved embarrassing for the democratic party and cost dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz her job at the top of the committee instead  trump famously blamed any hacking and counter election offenses by a  pound guy in a basement somewhere in the united states  without providing evidence  while trump peddles conspiracy theories  democrats seek to legitimize the electoral process of the united states featured image via winn mcnamee getty images
