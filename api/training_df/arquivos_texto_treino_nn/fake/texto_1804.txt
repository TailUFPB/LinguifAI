sen  bernie sanders says that he doesn t think it s likely that donald trump will be reelected to a second term now that the american people have had a chance to see what he s really about  speaking in new york  the vermont senator said he thinks that trump will be a one term president  in terms of the first three months in office  donald trump is the least popular president in the history of polling   sanders said  i do not believe that if trump continues these policies that he s going to be reelected  nor do i think that the republicans are going to do well in   sanders explained that a wave of progressivism has taken hold and is sweeping across the country  this  he added  does not bode well for conservatives  the momentum right now is with the progressive movement in this country   sanders said   and i think the republicans are on the defensive and will be on the defensive increasingly  the senator offered up tuesday s special election in kansas to replace now cia director mike pompeo as an example of this trend  although it was a deep red district that trump won hands down in the presidential election  republican candidate ron estes just barely managed to scrape by with a narrow win over civil rights attorney james thompson  d   the republicans had to spend money like crazy at the end to beat him   sanders said   i think that s a very good omen for the future  judging by the way the beginning of trump s presidency has gone  you have to wonder if trump will even get the chance to run for reelection  the fbi and both houses of congress are investigating the probability that he colluded with russia to steal the election  if he is found to have committed treason  he will most likely end up impeached and may have to worry more about a prison term than a second term featured image via scott eisen getty images
