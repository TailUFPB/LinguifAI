as you know  donald trump put aside his disdain for intelligence  intelligence briefings  and basically anything associated with the  i word   after all  he does love  the poorly educated  to attend a briefing on vladimir putin s hack of our election on friday  though the meeting was intended to drive the point home that    russia did indeed hack our election     the hack was meant to get donald trump elected  and wikileaks was definitely used to disseminate the hacked documents  the donald somehow managed to leave the meeting more sure than ever that he is right friday night  he went straight to his favorite pastime  victim blaming   gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take place   trump said   the republican national committee had strong defense  gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take place the republican national committee had strong defense   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    reality  as was made public some time ago  the republican national c ommitteewas also hacked  but putin chose not to release the information because he was trying to install his big orange puppet in the white house  but trump  like nearly every republican ever  has never been known to let facts get in the way of his beliefs apparently  having not  gotten it all out  yet  trump woke up and tweeted another barrage of stupidity before you even had your morning cup of coffee   intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results   he wrote in his morning dose of stupidity   voting machines not touched  intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results  voting machines not touched   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     there is strong evidence that the hacking affected the election results  though no one at any point has claimed that voting machines were altered in any way   something he would have known before that meeting if he cared at all about fact checking before he unleashes on twitter   had he listened in his meeting  he would know that the report did not actually look into whether the hack impacted the election results we did not make an assessment of the impact that russian activities had on the outcome of the  election  the us intelligence community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions  capabilities  and actions of foreign actors  it does not analyze us political processes or us public opinion but what this all comes down to is ego  according to trump  he doesn t mean his  of course  but he feels that democrats  fragile little egos were crushed because  the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed  only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    course  trump actually lost the popular vote by nearly three million and he managed one of the most humiliating  wins  even by the standards of the electoral college  a system that was put in place solely to benefit slave owners by making rural voters  ballots count more than many other americans   in fact  only  elections since  have seen winners with fewer delegate votes than trump received  if anyone s ego is causing anyone to lash out like a madman  one only needs to look at trump s twitter feed to see whom that is naturally  he got thrashed by the denizens of twitter  realdonaldtrump you lost by over  million popular votes  you won the election but slow down on the  big  win   tony posnanski   tonyposnanski  january    realdonaldtrump you won electoral votes  but lost the popular vote by the biggest margin ever  america knows a loser when it sees one  you   omeed   omeed  january    realdonaldtrump so when are you going public about being putin s ride or die chick  pic twitter com   kristina wong   mskristinawong  january    realdonaldtrump go fuck yourself   noah kalina   noahkalina  january     realdonaldtrump gop was also hacked  relevant question  extent of your knowledge regarding russia  putin s efforts to win election for you   jeffrey guterman   jeffreyguterman  january     realdonaldtrump you literally lost by  million votes even though the russians hacked and interfered on your behalf   shannon watts   shannonrwatts  january    realdonaldtrump this may be hard to understand  but we would like our future elections to not have a sprinkling of russian involvement   matthewdicks   matthewdicks  january    realdonaldtrump their embarrassment over losing to the likes of you doesn t mitigate or negate the attack on our nation s election process   matthewdicks   matthewdicks  january    realdonaldtrump you might want to delete this tweet  it s sort of designed for ridicule  like the largest softball in all of human history   matthewdicks   matthewdicks  january    realdonaldtrump this is a false equivalence yes  they are embarrassed to lose to a bigot yes  putin undermined our election process   matthewdicks   matthewdicks  january    flanaganaj    steveclarkuk  realdonaldtrump it was the  largest electoral win  so even by that standard it wasn t  huge    jeff fecke   jkfecke  january    report trump ignored states that the  election interference dwarfs anything russia has done in the past russian efforts to influence the  us presidential election represent the most recent expression of moscow s longstanding desire to undermine the us led liberal democratic order  but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness  level of activity  and scope of effort compared to previous operations ultimately  no matter what trump says  these are the facts we assess russian president vladimir putin ordered an influence campaign in  aimed at the us presidential election  russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the us democratic process  denigrate secretary clinton  and harm her electability and potential presidency  we further assess putin and the russian government developed a clear preference for president elect trump  we have high confidence in these judgments we also assess putin and the russian government aspired to help president elect trump s election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him  all three agencies agree with this judgment  cia and fbi have high confidence in this judgment  nsa has moderate confidence moscow s approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on russia s understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates  when it appeared to moscow that secretary clinton was likely to win the election  the russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency trump has once again proven himself to be an imbecile who isn t qualified to run a banana stand let alone the country  he s right about one thing  though  democrats are  totally embarrassed    not because of a  bigly  loss  but because our country somehow kinda sorta elected someone who stands for everything it does not featured image via getty images  mark wilson  screengrab
