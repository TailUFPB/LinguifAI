following covfefe gate  in which trump made an absolute fool of himself and spicer managed to make an even bigger fool of the whole white house  trump decided to get back down to business by taking aim at a truly pressing issue   hillary clinton  because of course he did  she gave an interview in which she discussed her electoral college loss  and because trump can t do anything but attack his imaginary enemies  he took to twitter to call her  crooked hillary  once again however  hillary appears to have been ready for that  covfefe apparently isn t going away anytime soon  and she used it to hit him back on his sheer hypocrisy  saying   people in covfefe houses shouldn t throw covfefe  it s not the content of her tweet that s remarkable  though  what she did was outshine trump on twitter by nearly  to  on retweets  and  to  on likes  take a look below if trump s popularity is of such concern to him  this will have him livid if he sees it  she owned him right after he tried to tell all of europe that he s the most important person on the planet  and the popularity of her tweet plays right into trump s ongoing insecurity about the legitimacy of his presidency  since she won the popular vote by nearly  million it s actually shocking that he didn t pass out electoral maps in europe to prove how beloved he is here  but then again  he doesn t know what that map actually shows   all he sees is all the red and assumes that means everyone in america  with a few isolated exceptions  is behind him hillary is by no means perfect  and she wouldn t have been the perfect president  but she also wouldn t be humiliating us repeatedly the way that trump does  trump is making a mockery of the u s image of hillary by astrid stawiarz getty images for the foundation for women  image of trump by sean gallup getty images
