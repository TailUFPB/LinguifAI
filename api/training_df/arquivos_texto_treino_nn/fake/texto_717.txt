donald trump s white house has been going through a lot of insane changes lately  and it is certainly looking like a sign of an inevitable implosion it was just a few days ago that white house press secretary sean spicer resigned over trump s hiring of anthony scaramucci as his new communications director  now  another key player in trump s administration is out thanks to  the mooch    white house chief of staff reince priebus  trump announced this shocking change in staff over twitter  remarking that retired four star general and secretary of homeland security john f  kennedy would be taking priebus  place we might have seen this coming   yesterday  scaramucci told the new yorker that priebus was a  f cking paranoid schizophrenic  and made several other vulgar comments about the former republican national committee president while this story is still developing  these rapid changes in staff show an administration that is clearly in trouble and struggling to keep its head above water as it self destructs  trump s staff is being turned over at an unprecedented rate  and the amount of in fighting between even the top staffers is like nothing we ve ever seen before  but what else can you expect when you appoint the most vile  corrupt individuals to help you run a country if the leaks coming from the white house weren t concerning enough  the recent changes in staff serve as a telling sign that things are falling apart on a daily basis and trump is desperate to save his failing presidency  already  trump s new communication director anthony scaramucci has become one of the most hated  abrasive characters in trump s administration and is causing trouble with other staffers  we can only imagine what this administration will look like in the weeks to come   and it s probably safe to say that recovery will be impossible featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
