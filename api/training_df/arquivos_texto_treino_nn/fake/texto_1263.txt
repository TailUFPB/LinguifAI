donald trump may have been guilty in intentionally scheduled his first overseas trip to temporarily escape his russia scandal just as things started really heating up  unfortunately for trump  now that he is back in the states  the investigation is once again catching up to him one thing trump will regret during this whole russia investigation is his volatile  tense relationship with the press  thanks to his own abrasive personality  trump has made many enemies with major networks  one of the main ones being cnn  earlier today  cnn sent a pretty direct message to trump  one that should scare him for the remainder of the investigation while cnn was covering trump s live white house event  where the potus was speaking about the  air traffic control reform initiative   cnn found the perfect opportunity to troll trump  using an on air chyron  cnn promoted the explosive testimony of former fbi director james comey  which is only three days away  this graphic appeared throughout trump s announcement  as a reminder that trump s troubles are just beginning  you can see the chyron below cnn likely had a ball thinking of ways the network could troll trump before settling on this  the comey investigation was a perfect choice  though   without a doubt  trump is practically sh tting his pants over this  judging by the pattern of erratic tweets that have recently been sent out  as they always are whenever poor donnie is stressed out about something it won t be long before trump finds out what cnn did during his event and lashes out in response  but no matter how much he attacks cnn and the media as a whole  it won t help him in the russia investigation  or make comey s testimony go away  trump will finally have to face the music  and most of us cannot wait featured image via mark wilson   getty images
