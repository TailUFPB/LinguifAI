donald trump fell on his face repeatedly during sunday night s debate  perhaps he was too busy thinking about what president obama said about him only hours earlier the republican nominee is under tremendous fire and his campaign is imploding after some lewd comments about groping women dropped like a bombshell on friday  trump and his team have been scrambling ever since while republicans have been running as far away as they can from the blast radius during an event in chicago in support of rep  tammy duckworth s senate bid  president obama finally chimed in on the disgusting remarks  which was perfect timing considering the second presidential debate between hillary and trump was only a few hours away from commencing in st  louis  one of the most disturbing things about this election is just the unbelievable rhetoric coming at the top of the republican ticket   obama said of the remarks   i don t need to repeat it  there are children in the room  president obama was clearly referencing trump s  remarks  which included a declaration that he is so famous that he just walks up to women and  grabs them by the p ssy  demeaning women  degrading women  but also minorities  immigrants  people of other faiths  mocking the disabled  insulting our troops  insulting our veterans  that tells you a couple things   obama continued   it tells you that he s insecure enough that he pumps himself up by putting other people down not a character trait that i would advise for somebody in the oval office  it tells you that he doesn t care much about the basic values that we try to impart to our kids  it tells you he d be careless with the civility and the respect that a real  vibrant democracy requires  here s the video via cnn so maybe donald trump had a hard time during the debate last night partly because he was seething from being burned by president obama  regardless of why trump got his ass handed to him on the debate stage again  the fact remains that he is unfit to be president and president obama perfectly made it clear that insulting a great majority of americans is the biggest reason to keep trump out of the white house america needs a president who respects all of the people  not someone who has disrespected more than half of them featured image  screenshot
