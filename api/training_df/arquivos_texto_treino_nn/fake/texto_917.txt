on wednesday  senator pat toomey  r pa  gave a shockingly honest response to why the senate s long awaited health care plan is being held back for so long as republicans are definitely feeling the pressure to release a superior health care plan to obamacare  especially because they whined about how horrible the affordable care act was for years   they continue to come up empty handed and america is wondering what the hell is taking them so long to prepare what they should have been thinking about the entire time obama was in office toomey gave an interesting reason for the delay at a town hall  practically blaming it on the fact that no one in the republican party actually had any faith that trump would win  and therefore didn t bother taking their obamacare replacement seriously  in a confession that would make mitch mcconnell and paul ryan go into hiding  toomey admitted  i didn t expect donald trump to win  i think most of my colleagues didn t  so we didn t expect to be in this situation  trump himself hasn t made this easy for the gop  as he continues to change his mind about the bill  not long after he praised the house s version of the bill during a ceremony  he called the plan mean  toomey also spent time during the town hall criticizing trump for his attacks on the media  particularly msnbc s morning joe hosts  toomey said  every president has had tension with the press  i think it s best to ignore it  toomey made it perfectly clear that he s not really a fan of trump s  and it might have been wishful thinking on his part that trump wouldn t get elected and we would instead be calling hillary clinton  potus   after watching trump s performance for the last six months  toomey could only give trump a grade of incomplete  toomey said  my assessment is it s mixed  something tells us a lot of republicans would agree featured image via pool getty images
