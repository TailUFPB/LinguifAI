trump supporters are furious after a member of the choir took a courageous stand donald trump and his team have been desperately searching for talent to perform at his inauguration on january  with very little success  so far  they have a former america s got talent contestant to sing the national anthem and the mormon tabernacle choir of course  mormons voted for trump despite claiming that they opposed him throughout the campaign  even bill maher applauded the mormon church as the only religious organization that seemed to not want to vote for someone hypocritical to their faith  but they did anyway as utah went for trump on election day the rockettes are being forced to dance at the inauguration as well  which set off a firestorm among the members because trump is a creepy pervert and sexual predator and for one member of the mormon tabernacle choir  looking at herself in the mirror every morning was getting more and more difficult  so after much thought and prayer  she announced that she is resigning rather than sing for a tyrant in a facebook post  jan chamberlin courageously explained why she had to quit the choir she loves after five years since  the announcement   i have spent several sleepless nights and days in turmoil and agony  i have reflected carefully on both sides of the issue  prayed a lot  talked with family and friends  and searched my soul  i ve tried to tell myself that by not going to the inauguration  that i would be able to stay in choir for all the other good reasons  i have highly valued the mission of the choir to be good  will ambassadors for christ  to share beautiful music and to give hope  inspiration  and comfort to others  i ve tried to tell myself that it will be alright and that i can continue in good conscience before god and man  but it s no use  i simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events  i could never look myself in the mirror again with self respect  i also know  looking from the outside in  it will appear that choir is endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man   she continued and choir s wonderful image and networking will be severely damaged and that many good people throughout this land and throughout the world already do and will continue to feel betrayed  i believe hereafter our message will not be believed by many that have loved us and adored what we have stood for  i know that i too feel betrayed  tyranny is now on our doorstep  it has been sneaking its way into our lives through stealth  now it will burst into our homes through storm  i hope that we and many others will work together with greater dilligence and awareness to calmly and bravely work together to defend our freedoms and our rights for our families  our friends  and our fellow citizens chamberlin went on to note that her father was  distraught  over the holocaust and that her parents despised tyranny  she sees history repeating itself and warned that we need to educate ourselves and fight back before it s too late i only know i could never  throw roses to hitler   and i certainly could never sing for him  much love to you all  i wish you all blessings and happiness  my heart is shattered and broken   but my conscience is clear  and that  really is all that matters predictably  trump supporters lashed out at chamberlin i bet all of these bullies hated president obama for the last eight years and cheered on the republican obstructionism and utter disrespect they showed him  yet  they have the gall to accuse chamberlin of not being a true christian  sad the other  members of the choir should follow this brave woman s lead featured image via screenshot
