critics are calling former fox news host  megyn kelly s upcoming interview with the conspiracy theorist and noted lunatic  alex jones on her new home at nbc an act of irresponsibility to the public  or  as the panel of media critics on cnn s reliable sources put it  jones is a virus and kelly is giving him the opportunity to create a viral outbreak of bullshit political positions  maureen ryan  variety s chief television critic  argued that the context of the interview was a major factor in determining the quality of the programming  she asserts that jones is certainly worth educating people about but feels the format is all wrong  ryan explains  i just think the context in which this coverage takes place is really important  if you were telling me that nbc was doing an hour long documentary on the rise of this kind of disinformation media empires  i would say that s great  this is important to take into consideration  both as a media critique and as a talking point to those who wish to decry the media s admonishment of kelly and nbc as simply being part of a conspiracy to shut out so called  truth tellers  like jones   a talking point that is both in vogue with the alt right and quite lazy  if i am being honest    i don t think giving alex jones  or  minutes to simply spin his views and to spin his media image is the way in which to attack this   ryan went on to add   megyn kelly has not proven herself to be the kind of dogged interviewer that would be able to make a meal of this  kelly s entire career could be used as a citation for this claim  though kelly s recent pathetic interview with russian president vladimir putin does a great job of summarizing her consistent failings as a news celebrity  i m incapable of referring to her as a journalist at this point   the show s host  brian stelter  mentions one defense of nbc s airing of the interview that came from nbc  the defense  according to stelter  is that   terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television  it s actually quite sad to hear such vapid analysis from a major broadcasting company like nbc  if not surprising  obviously  there is a defense between the likes of jones and the rest of the scary cadre of deplorable individuals that are mentioned  those types of people are almost always automatically viewed as illegitimate by audiences  it s hard to imagine jones on the other hand  as stacking up to these types of criminals  as nutty as jones is  he sounds sane  if not by much from a left wing perspective  when compared to a terrorist spokesperson  stelter goes on to speculate on whether the current political climate is playing a part in people s anger towards kelly and nbc   alex jones is a virus  there s maybe a fear of spreading that virus more fully on a big network  if it bleeds it ledes   goes the journalist cliche  while an interview with jones likely won t lead to blood spilling  it will get people to tune in to view the verbal carnage  this interview is going to be very profitable to nbc  it should be remembered by all  that nbc is a corporation and their obligations are to turn a profit  which even in dark times we are in still appears to trump their obligations as a member of the fourth estate you can watch the segment below featured image from video screenshot
