this is a clear case of election rigging south dakota secretary of state shantel krebs is running for congress in   but rather than win the votes of the people fair and square  krebs is using her current position to stack the odds in her favor the dakota free press pointed out that krebs has purged thousands of voters from the rolls in the last threes months the september     south dakota voter registration tally shows   voters    of the august  total removed from active status and   newly inactive voters  this one month purge restocks the inactive pool  which the secretary of state has whittled down over the last  months from a march  peak of   to an august  low of    inactives now total   thus  in three months  the secretary of state managed to scrub    of the names on the voter rolls considering how close elections can be in this country  three percent is a big deal and could easily be enough to guarantee a victory for krebs in november  in fact  democratic voters were targeted most by krebs  which makes it all the more clear that she is rigging the election to help herself  in all    percent of democratic voters were purged from the rolls  if democratic voters are kept from voting  her opponent doesn t stand a chance against her and that s probably the whole point this is voter suppression in its ugliest form  no candidate for office should have unfettered access to the voter rolls  as secretary of state  krebs is supposed to make sure elections are fair  but because she is going to be a congressional candidate in   it appears she has thrown fairness out the window because winning is more important to her  when she pulls up the list of voters whom the state hasn t heard from for a while  it wouldn t be hard to sort that list by party and start with the democrats first   the dakota free press noted that means krebs has a conflict of interest and she should be forced to resign featured image via mark wilson getty images
