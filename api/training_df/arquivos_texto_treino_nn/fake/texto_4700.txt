donald trump is continuing his campaign of fear mongering  this time insisting that the  election will be the last actual election unless americans put him in the white house  appearing for an interview on the christian broadcasting network  trump told host david brody that republicans will never have a chance at the white house again because you re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they re going to be legalized and they re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it  so  in other words  trump is once again blaming immigrants for all of the republican party s problems  the thing is  though  the gop s issues are of their own making  they are on the wrong side of history on issues of race  women s issues  their fervent bigotry against the lgbtq community  their denial of science  and any other number of issues  in other words  until they stop being the party of bigotry  they will never appeal to anyone but bigots  and there just aren t enough of them left in the general electorate for a majority to want to put an obvious racist in the white house  here is the transcript of that exchange  via right wing watch trump  i think it s going to be the last election that the republicans can win  if we don t win this election  you ll never see another republican and you ll have a whole different church structure  you re going to have a whole different supreme court structure  that has to do a lot with what we re doing because the supreme court  as you know with justice scalia gone  i think you could probably have four to five judges picked by the next president  probably a record number  david  probably a record number of judges  if they pick the super liberals  probably to a certain extent  people that would make bernie sanders happy  you will never have a supreme court  we re going to end up with another venezuela  large scale version  it would be a disaster for the country brody  just so i understand  when you say last election are you referring to what michele bachmann was talking about with citizenship because hillary is talking about potentially providing citizenship for many of these illegals  florida and texas could be gone trump  i think this will be the last election if i don t win  i think this will be the last election that the republicans have a chance of winning because you re going to have people flowing across the borders  you re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they re going to be legalized and they re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it  i guarantee you  you re not going to have one republican vote  and it s already a very hard number  already the path is much more difficult for the republicans  you just have to look at the maps and the path is much more difficult and here is the video the thing is  republicans have no one to thank for the mass defection from their party but themselves  they ve trafficked in hate  conspiracy theories  science denial  and theocratic bigotry for decades  donald trump is the natural result of cultivating those sorts of uninformed  ignorant voters   the voters that make up their base that they have to pander to  but  of course  they ll never admit it  and their hateful  archaic party will go into the ash heap of history and into irrelevancy at the national level where it belongs featured image via joe raedle getty images
