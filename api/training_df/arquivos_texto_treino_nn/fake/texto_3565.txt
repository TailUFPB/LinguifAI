throughout his campaign  donald trump repeatedly attacked the press and went as far as to point to msnbc nbc reporter katy tur at a rally in which she later had to be escorted out by the secret service  trump is playing a dangerous game by villainizing journalists  trump supporters agree with everything he says and when he attacks reporters  they are happy to attack them  too  they are literally attacking the constitution because freedom of the press is protected by the first amendment  to dumb it down for trump supporters  it s the amendment before the second amendment former vice president dick cheney is apparently a fan of donald trump s  he suggested recently that the president elect s social media usage means that american citizens no longer needed the news media with dick cheney in his corner  that should be a wake up call to his supporters at the reagan national defense forum  cnn s barbara starr asked the former vice president if trump s casual tone on twitter was dangerous  i do think you need to be careful   cheney said   but he ll learn as he goes along  i think he is putting some brains and good people with him  i am a big fan of  mike pence  i think one of the reasons people get so concerned about the tweets is it s sort of a way around the press   dick said   it s modern era  modern technology  he s at the point where we don t need you guys anymore  i apologize   cheney added watch at around the  minute mark apology not accepted  dick oh sure  just what we need  a president who has to  learn as he goes along   trump supporters wanted a man in the white house with zero political experience  it s like giving the keys to your bentley to a guy who doesn t have a driver s license the establishment sure is backing the supposed anti establishment president elect photo by mark wilson via getty
