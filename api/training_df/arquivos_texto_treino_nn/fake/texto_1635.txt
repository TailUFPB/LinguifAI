donald trump isn t enjoying his time as president  in a series of interviews marking the first  days of his presidency  he s done an awful lot of whining and complaining  including saying that the job is much harder than he thought one of the reasons the job is so hard for him is that he s not a dictator  as much as he d like to be one  his powers are limited by a document called the constitution and that frustrates the hell out of him  even though he has an entirely republican federal government in an interview with fox news on friday  trump appeared to have learned a new word  and he used it four times in reference to the constitution  that word was  archaic   and in his context  it was particularly disconcerting because it signaled his desire to completely do away with the constraints of the constitution and with our system of checks and balances remember when white nationalist house stooge and millennial most likely to be punched steven miller said that  that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned   a collective chill went up the spines of thinking americans  be prepared to feel that chill again  here s what trump said on friday in an interview with fox news to mark the  day mark  he declared himself  disappointed  with congressional republicans  despite his many  great relationships  with them he blamed the constitutional checks and balances built in to us governance   it s a very rough system   he said   it s an archaic system   it s really a bad thing for the country  here s the video mostly  trump wants to get rid of the filibuster  he has no authority whatsoever over the rules of the senate  and while the senate leadership could change the rules  in theory  it would be quite short sighted because it would mean that the next time democrats have even a slim majority  republicans would be powerless to get anything accomplished or to stop a democratic agenda when president obama wasn t able to get past the filibuster  donald trump called him weak and ineffectual  now that the loafer is on trump s foot  it s the constitution s fault  do you have chills yet featured image via getty images pool
