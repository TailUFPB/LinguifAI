donald trump thought he could get away with using military veterans as props to push his political agenda  he was wrong marine staff sgt  john jones lost both of his legs in combat in iraq over ten years ago  in   he sat down for a photograph showing him with the prosthetic legs that allow him to stand and walk jones was back in the news this past weekend after trump shared the photo on twitter to attack nfl players who kneel during the national anthem i wonder what this brave american would give to stand on his own two legs just once more for our  anthem   maga  nfl pic twitter com   donna warren        september    of now  the retweet remains on trump s twitter feed trump literally exploited a wounded veteran to attack the nfl over protests that have nothing to do with the flag or america s men and women in uniform  the fact is that the nfl players are protesting racial injustice and police brutality  trump  however  is trying to divide the nation by accusing them of disrespecting the military and the flag but by using an image of a wounded veteran to push his agenda  trump opened himself up to being humiliated by those veterans because jones is very much still alive and able to speak up for himself and he does not appreciate being used as a political prop to oppose the right to free speech according to buzzfeed jones says he is sick of military veterans being used as props  to push a political agenda  in the renewed controversy over whether athletes  protests  which they say draw attention to racial discrimination and police brutality  disrespect the military  if you really want to honor the troops  listen to them  he says  just stop with this sycophantic bullshit and actually do something to support us   said jones  who works for workshops for warriors  a san diego nonprofit that has trained more than  veterans for skilled manufacturing jobs   i would want trump to tweet about that  instead of fueling the fire with the people making  million to score a freaking touchdown  and for people  seeing the photo  to say   look  he s still standing for this country  and getting veterans good jobs  jones then went on to defend the nfl players  i ve got my own views about this  but that s why i put the uniform on  so people can do whatever they want in a lawful  peaceful manner  i m sorry  but if you want to know what the real issues are   go to iraq  or syria  or afghanistan  go to places that don t have the freedoms that we have and see how far you get  protesting during the national anthem is not illegal  in fact  it s protested as free speech and expression by our constitution  and silently kneeling in protest is peaceful even john mccain condemned trump this week by pointing out that nfl players have the right as citizens to kneel during the national anthem by using wounded veterans as political props  trump is the one who is truly disrespecting the military and our nation featured image  mark wilson getty images
