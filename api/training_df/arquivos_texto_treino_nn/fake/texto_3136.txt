on friday  donald trump decided to distract from revelations that intelligence agencies had identified the individual russians who delivered hacked documents to wikileaks on behalf of the donald s  best friend  vladimir putin by proving to the world that what he lacks in his desire to attend intelligence briefings he makes up for in his adherence to the principle that  ratings aree everything  wow  the ratings are in and arnold schwarzenegger got  swamped   or destroyed  by comparison to the ratings machine  djt  so much for    trump tweeted  nine minutes later  he added   being a movie star and that was season  compared to season   now compare him to my season   but who cares  he supported kasich   hillary  wow  the ratings are in and arnold schwarzenegger got  swamped   or

comparison to the ratings machine  djt  so much for    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    it is true that celebrity apprentice debuted with low numbers    percent down from the last year trump hosted  this probably has more to do with the fact that the president elect is still listed as executive producer for the show than any other factor  after all  more than half the country wants nothing to do with him   as president  or as part of a television show that has been steadily dropping in ratings for years  executive producer donald j  trump  pic twitter com   steve kopack

with the intelligence briefing  after all  he has maintained for months that he had secret information that proves vladimir putin s gang didn t hack his political enemies for him  he has repeatedly attacked our intelligence agencies for bringing it to light  as abc reports  the proof that trump was lying to the american people is quite strong overnight   just hours after president barack obama received the report   new details emerged of just what is contained in the secret document a senior official briefed on the intelligence sources  methods and assessments in the report that trump will receive this morning told abc news that the findings are clear  the evidence points directly to the kremlin and to russian president vladimir putin in what one official described as  multiple streams and types of intelligence collection  not just forensic examinations of the hacked systems   those various streams of information gathered by u s  spy agencies include signals intelligence such as intercepts of communications between russian officials in which they implicated the kremlin s own espionage  as abc news reported last month the washington post reported late on thursday that the eavesdropping caught senior russian officials actually cheering trump s surprise victory in november as a success of the kremlin s intelligence program and vice president joe biden   who was privy to the classified briefing that trump will receive today   told the pbs newshour that   there s overwhelming consensus in the community and overwhelming evidence supplied by the community that russia did engage in an effort to impact on the elections  there is clear evidence that they in fact were engaged in activities designed to try and impact in the outcome of the election   biden said  while noting there was  no evidence that they actually tampered with voting booths or tampered with voting rolls  referring to parts of the report which will be made public next week  biden said   it will state clearly that the russians did as a matter of policy  attempt to  discredit the us electoral process  and  attempt to hurt mrs  clinton  contrary to trump s public bloviations director of national intelligence  james clapper  says that the attacks were approved at the highest level of government in russia    and by that  he means that  the highest is president putin  recently  barack obama expelled more than  suspected russian intelligence operatives from the country  vladimir putin responded by saying he would wait to respond until his puppet   sorry  trump   was officially
