two florida republican lawmakers voted against a   billion hurricane relief bill just as irma churned toward the state  congressmen matt gaetz  r fl  and ted yoho  r fl  claim they have concerns about other provisions of the measure  irma is now a category  storm with maximum sustained winds of  mph but forecasters expect the storm to strengthen  presently  the florida keys is facing a potentially catastrophic force that could threaten to drown entire islands but  it s obviously more important for gaetz and yoho to exercise their conservative bonafides the relief package sailed through the senate and the house and was signed by donald trump on friday  the package boosts funding for the federal emergency management agency  fema   a necessary move at this time following the destruction left by hurricane harvey and much more expected after florida feels irma s force and fury  also  fema is running out of money so the funds are needed the package will also raise the debt ceiling for three months and includes a short term budget that would keep the government running until december  the deal struck between trump and democratic leaders sen  charles e  schumer  n y   and rep  nancy pelosi  calif   sent republicans into a panic while disregarding that lives are at stake after the deadly storm obliterated houston  texas the washington post reports that latter was a problem for gop reps  matt gaetz and ted yoho  who stuck to their principles of fiscal conservatism despite calls from fellow florida lawmakers to support the bill  the two  who are among the  house republicans who voted against the bill  do not represent parts of the state that are likely to feel irma s immediate impact as the massive storm makes landfall on mainland united states this weekend  snaking in a debt ceiling increase with funding for victims and communities affected is immoral and reflective of broken leadership in washington   yoho said after the vote friday   i do not think it wise to extend our borrowing limit without mandatory spending reforms       if this was a clean measure that focused on those affected by hurricane harvey  i would have proudly voted for it  gaetz  whose district includes coastal areas along the gulf of mexico  said the debt limit should be raised only if it includes cuts in entitlement programs  which is really heartless since many victims of the hurricanes will need a hand up after losing everything they owned in the world  i have a pretty strident view that i will only vote to raise the debt limit if that vote is accompanied by reductions in entitlement spending   gaetz said   if conservatives don t start voting no against debt limit increases  all the fema in the world won t save us from our most unfortunate destiny  u s  sen  ted cruz  r texas  was against federal aid for victims of hurricane sandy  then a natural disaster struck his state with deadly force  suddenly  he s cool with aid being provided to his state  funny how that works  but the other two republicans just don t want to help anyone  even their own constituents photo  andrew harrer bloomberg via getty images
