a quick look at the statistics shows that six of the  deadliest mass shootings on record in the us have occurred in the last decade  the top two less than  months apart  yet republicans have generally been opposed to almost any form of gun control  however  that appears to be changing in the aftermath of yet another tragedy democrats  spearheaded by california senator dianne feinstein  the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee  have proposed a ban on an accessory known as a  bump stock   which uses the recoil of a semi automatic firearm to fire several hundred shots per minute without compromising on accuracy  something that really isn t necessary for even the most avid outdoorsman  and a device that few lawmakers had even heard of before monday the most surprising part of this proposal is that it is gaining support from republicans across the board and it s the first time republicans have even considered discussing any form of gun control since   when  year old adam lanza shot and killed  children aged between six and seven years old  as well as six adult staff members  at sandy hook elementary school in newtown  connecticut republican support for the proposal  however  is a small victory along the long and bumpy road to becoming legislation  not only will the measure need to be approved by republicans on capitol hill  it will also need the backing of president trump  whose campaign last year was heavily endorsed by the infinitely powerful national rifle association  nra  all the same  it is an excellent start when a congressman from texas is the first republican to support the ban on bump stocks  that congressman is bill flores  i think they should be banned  there s no reason for a typical gun owner to own anything that converts a semi automatic to something that behaves like an automatic   flores  a gun owner  said in an interview just off the house floor  based on the videos i heard and saw  and now that i ve studied up on what a bump stock is   i didn t know there was such a thing   there s no reason for it   he added  i have no problem from banning myself from owning it  other house republican moderates that agree with flores include charlie dent and ryan costello from pennsylvania  leonard lance of new jersey and pete king from new york  i m ready to say that they should not be in public use  i think they are a problem  i support a ban on bump stocks  i don t see any purpose for them   dent said  the law is clear to me that automatic weapons are banned in this country  as they should be  featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
