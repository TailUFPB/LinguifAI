three students at a florida high school are suspended for wearing kkk costumes to school for homecoming  the students from wiregrass ranch high school in pasco county no doubt thought they were being funny or cute  or maybe they thought they were making some kind of a statement  regardless  they upset many of their fellow students with the costumes  which they initially claimed were ghost costumes the theme for the day was  characters   and most students who chose to dress up dressed as superheroes or television characters  these three chose to emulate one of the most racist hate groups ever to exist in the u s   but for what reason  nobody seems to know  a fourth student was wearing a confederate flag  but that student took it off after being asked to  and doesn t face any disciplinary action the outfits consisted of white sheets and pointy white hoods  very  very reminiscent of the kkk  not ghosts  they posted a photo of themselves in the costumes on social media with the caption   bruhhhhhhh  on it  pasco county district superintendent kurt browning said  usually ghosts don t have pointed hoods  no  they don t  a senior at the school believes that these three had to have known what they were doing   ghost costumes look very different from kkk outfits and everyone who grew up in the u s  knows it  we all see ghosts everywhere at halloween  and we all see images of the kkk in our history books and media furthermore  with all the protests against police brutality toward the black community going on  there s a lot of racial tension  black people are being killed in the streets by police  and white people don t want to acknowledge that the root of that problem is systemic racism  so the problem just continues  white people also insist on trying to dictate when  where and how the black community can protest  which just makes the black community angrier  and rightfully so because of all of that  kkk outfits  no matter the context  are especially inflammatory two of the students were hispanic  and one was arabic  none of them were black or white  there s a possibility they thought they were making some kind of a statement about the white nationalism that trump has uncorked and normalized here they might have specifically intended to harass black students and faculty there they might have just thought they were being funny and cute  and they may have even thought they wouldn t get in any trouble because they aren t white there is just no way they didn t know what they were doing  though  browning touched on that when he went on to say  the last thing we need is to have any student regardless of race dressed up in that type of costume  the students received a two day suspension  so hopefully they learned differently  the kkk no matter who you are is a hate symbol  whatever the students  motives were  there is zero excuse watch a report on this incident below  from wfts featured image via screen capture from embedded video
