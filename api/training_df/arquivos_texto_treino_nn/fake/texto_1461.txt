ivanka trump really should stop talking about these issues if she is going to continue to be complicit in her daddy s administration despite the fact that her dad s policies hurt women and children  ivanka posted a mother s day message on twitter focusing on pay inequality today  on mother s day  we must confront that motherhood is now a greater determinant of pay inequality than gender  https   t co   ivanka trump   ivankatrump  may    inequality is a major problem in this country  women currently make around  cents for every dollar a man makes for the same job and amount of work  at the same time  women also have to deal with the fact that maternity leave is often not a benefit offered by employers  nor is childcare  so it becomes even harder for women to make enough money to take care of their families but while ivanka may really care abut these issues  the problem is that she has mostly been a bystander whenever her dad signs legislation or an executive order that hurts women for example  the trumpcare bill would take healthcare away from millions of women  just being a woman would be considered a pre existing condition  so would sexual assault and pregnancy  not only would a lot of moms suffer under this bill  their children would suffer as well that s why ivanka has been repeatedly accused of being complicit she s a complete hypocrite who pretends to a be a feminist icon but she s not  and women had no problem calling her out on twitter for it  ivankatrump you care nothing about women  you blindly support your father who is a misogynistic sexist bully  and you do nothing   impeachtrumpnow  rena sofer   renasofer  may    ivankatrump pic twitter com tubyztykhs  cmerry   cmerry  may    ivankatrump did you know your father   the gop want to make c sections   sexual assault pre existing conditions  i don t think they  like women too much       may      ivankatrump her father has provided preexisting conditions to  women       wendy    resist   nstywmnwendy  may    ivankatrump where were you when it came to speaking out and defending women when healthcare was on the table   go home ivanka  you re drunk    maren     may    ivankatrump but not for u  right ivanka  your father doesn t support moms and he also thinks  troubled girls such as lindsey lohan  are better in bed    michelle jackino   djackino  may    ivankatrump have you met your father  apparently the man you speak highly of isn t  potus  help us remove this imposter   save our country from travesty  lisap     may    ivankatrump  fleurdelisazure but you don t want to cover pregnancy for women  you words are empty   traitor  brayz   brayleegirlk  may    ivankatrump far from what the statistics show  if your going to be a role model get your facts straight    michelle   mmbarricelli  may    ivankatrump ivanka  stop talking  if u cared anything abt women  u d have stepped away from daddy long ago   bonnie rand   musicalwhisper  may    ivankatrump you condone your father s  locker room  talk  his desire for incest among other atrocities against women  you  lady  have no credibility   paulaann     may    should also be pointed out that ivanka trump pays chinese workers pennies to manufacture her shitty products and clothing line  yet she still claims to care about pay inequality here in america if she really cared about women she would try to convince her dad to do something that helps them for once in his pathetic life featured image via sean gallup getty images
