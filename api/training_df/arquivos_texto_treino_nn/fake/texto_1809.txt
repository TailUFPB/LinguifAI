if you haven t heard  former trump advisor carter page was the subject of a successfully executed fisa warrant because of his dealings with russia  former fbi agent asha rangappa notes that the bar to obtain a warrant is extremely high and that the process of obtaining one  includes too many layers of approval to be granted without strong evidence   nevertheless  trump and his associates continue to complain that members of his campaign and administration became the subject of investigations because of their illegal activity on tuesday  the washington post reported that page became the focus of an investigation because a foreign intelligence surveillance court judge was thoroughly convinced that there was  probable cause to believe page was acting as an agent of a foreign power  in this case russia  appearing on cnn  braindead trump lemming kayleigh mcenany worked hard to dispel any idea that page colluding with russia is evidence that members of the campaign colluding with russia  i don t think it s evidence of the trump campaign colluding with russia at all   she said   he was a brief adviser on the campaign  and the campaign  trying to distance themselves from him   in reality  page was one of the first foreign policy advisors trump named  but look  i don t think we have any evidence to suggest that president trump knew that this guy was a foreign agent  and he wanted him on his campaign because he wanted to collude with russia   he said   that is another step that you have to make  and i don t think there are facts there to show that  here s the thing  whether or not trump knew is a nonissue  when trump was warned about michael flynn s shady dealing with russia  he brushed it off and kept the disgraced general on as national security advisor  he even fired the person who warned him  it would not have mattered to trump if he knew about page  because for some reason it s cool to work with russia under president  trump watch the interview below featured image via screengrab
