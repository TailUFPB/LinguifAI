if you thought no one in washington d c  was feeling the same way about donald trump as you are  think again  several people within the halls of congress think he s as illegitimate as you do in fact  one congressman  rep  ted lieu  d ca  has gone so far as to create a  cloud of illegitimacy clock  in honor of trump if you visit lieu s media center portion of his official congressional website  this is what you ll see lieu house govhere s lieu s statement regarding trump s violation of article   section  of the united states constitution  the second after donald trump took the oath of office  he violated the constitution and continues to do so  the framers wrote article   section  of the constitution to prevent foreign influence over our elected officials  it mandates that no person holding office  shall  without the consent of the congress  accept any present  emolument  office  or title  of any kind whatever from any king  prince  or foreign state   while holding office  mr  trump will receive by virtue of his continued interest in the vast and global trump organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents  this is illegal trump can stop his illegal behavior by divesting his global business interests or putting them into blind trusts  he refuses to do so  not only is he violating the law  he is explicitly putting his financial interests and those of his family above the interests of america  trump is not making america first  he is making america second as a member of the house judiciary committee  i will do everything i can to hold trump accountable  my first action is the creation of a cloud of illegitimacy clock that keeps track of the seconds  minutes  hours  and days that trump is operating outside of the law  at some point  the clock is going to catch up to trump  for now  trump appears to be taking the position of former president richard nixon that  when the president does it  that means it is not illegal   how did that work out  what trump is doing is illegal and action must be taken to stop it  either he needs to cut all financial ties completely or he should be forced to resign or impeached and brought to justice as the crook that he so apparently seems to be good on rep  lieu for taking the first steps in holding trump accountable  you can t do anything without calling him out on his illegal activity first  well done featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
