the moment donald trump is sworn in as president  congress could begin impeachment proceedings and they could win  it could easily happen  and as much as we can t stand trump  that would be horrible before you shake your head and dismiss this as just another conspiracy theory  here are some facts from a utah law professor  christopher lewis peterson  who wrote a  page article telling us how and why congress can and should impeach trump  clearly  we won t reprint all of the  pages  but here s the abstract  which by itself is pretty compelling in the final weeks of the  presidential campaign donald j  trump faces three lawsuits accusing him of fraud and racketeering  these ongoing cases focus on a series of wealth seminars called  trump university  which collected over   million from consumers seeking to learn trump s real estate investing strategies  although these consumer protection cases are civil proceedings  the underlying legal elements in several counts that plaintiffs seek to prove run parallel to the legal elements of serious crimes under both state and federal law  this essay provides a legal analysis of whether trump s alleged behavior would  if proven  rise to the level of impeachable offenses under the presidential impeachment clause of the united states constitution  this essay begins with a summary of the evidence assembled in the three pending trump university civil lawsuits  next  it describes the legal claims involved in each matter  then  this essay summarizes the applicable law of presidential impeachment under the united states constitution and analyzes whether trump s actions in connection with trump university are impeachable offenses  finally  i offer concluding thoughts  considering in particular the policy implications of a major presidential campaign with simultaneously pending legal complaints of fraud and racketeering now  why would a republican congress impeach a republican president  well  as you recall  the vast majority of the gop wing of congress only reluctantly supported trump speaker of the house  paul ryan  was perhaps the most vocal reluctant supporter  saying that he was  sickened  by trump s rhetoric  but would support him anyway most thought ryan was sticking with trump as a matter of political expediency  after all  they share the exact same voter base  but perhaps ryan  who s not stupid  had something up his sleeve  trump s vp pick  mike pence  is tailor made to help elevate paul ryan s agenda  he s  ber conservative and  ber christian  while trump is a wildcard  pence is someone who ryan can trust  pence won t squawk while ryan strips senior citizens of social security or the poor of food  trump might not squawk  but he s not predictable  either while both ryan and pence  and most republicans in congress  are social conservatives who want to set back rights for lgbt people and women  again  trump is a wildcard  trump used to be pro choice and despite the fact that his campaign was built on hate  he said very little about lgbt people  it s highly doubtful that trump will defend the rights of gay people or abortion rights  but that s not a chance ryan or republicans in congress want to take the trump university lawsuit is set to start at the end of the month  it s a civil suit  but it will highlight that voters elected a con man  it will certainly be enough to make the most anti trump members of congress talk and it could give us a president pence  yes  that s frightening featured image via mark wilson getty images
