bill maher laid into red state voters on friday night for sacrificing whatever humanity they had left to continue supporting donald trump the republican nominee s comments about groping women  the multiple allegations of sexual assault  and the new revelations that trump hit on teen girls and even walked in on miss teen usa contestants while they were naked are still not enough to convince his supporters to dump him but even if republicans get rid of trump  maher wondered if they can ever rid their party of trumpism writer rebecca traister said  no  because the gop is  built on it   she then explained that trump s voters represent the kind of people who have been working to oppress women and minorities for over a century and that the republican party has allowed trump s deplorables to gain a major foothold on the party  the fact is  republican voters who knew they were going to be facing hillary clinton  who hate barack obama  who object to the people who vote for democrats  people of color and women  selected a candidate who embodies the racism and sexism that are the very forces that kept people of color and women disenfranchised for centuries and away from the white house until now  they picked him  indeed  they chose trump to be their leader and now republicans leaders are kicking themselves for doing it because they are losing control of their party to the base  which is bad if the gop ever wants to win a general election again former nebraska senator bob kerrey said that we need to appeal to trump supporters to call out trump s behavior and comments toward women  saying that there are good people who are voting for trump  but maher doubted that trump s voters have any humanity left to give damn  when i look at the electoral map  i see states that trump apparently cannot possibly lose   maher pointed out  the pink are likely republican and the red are  like he said   i could shoot somebody in the middle of  avenue and they wouldn t leave me   the people of idaho  wyoming  arkansas  oklahoma  west virginia  kentucky   i know they re republican mostly  but they re human  right  these are human beings  what the f ck does it take  in this country  to have being a human being supersede being a republican  here s the video via youtube at this point  if red state voters haven t seen the error of their ways they aren t going to do so by election day  they will vote for trump  thus proving that they are nothing more than hateful uneducated sexist racist assholes who care more about watching the country burn than they do about making sure our great nation continues to strive on towards a better future  they don t care about america  they are not patriots  they are selfish people who surrendered their humanity a long time ago  they have turned into mere drones for the republican party  even if the party had nominated hitler for president these people would stand in line to shake his hand and then vote for him no matter the horrible things he has done  that s because even though these people claim to be  christians   the truth is that they sold their souls to the devil and the devil is apparently collecting on november   which means it s up to the rest of us to make sure he loses featured image via screenshot
