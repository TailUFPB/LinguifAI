many of us have been ready to impeach donald trump since election night  however  the downside to this scenario was the prospect of vice president mike pence taking his place  well  thanks to the testimony of former fbi director james comey  we may not have to worry about ending up with president pence when we finally manage to get rid of trump on thursday  comey testified about how trump had pressured him to drop his investigation into mike flynn s shady russian ties and tried to back him into a loyalty pledge  buried in his testimony  which contained one bombshell after another  was this little tidbit  pence  who was the head of trump s transition team  knew damn well that flynn was compromised by not one but two foreign governments   and he allowed him to be named national security adviser anyway  in a moment that went largely unnoticed  sen  ron wyden  d or  asked comey if pence was aware of flynn s connections to russia  the former head of the fbi said that yes  pence knew  he apparently just didn t care  my understanding is that he was   comey replied  adding that he got this information from then acting attorney general sally yates  who also ended up fired after angering trump this statement may become very important in coming months as we move closer and closer towards impeaching trump  if pence was in on all of this then he is just as dirty as trump and the rest of his crooked cronies  if there was anybody who still thought that maybe pence is just too oblivious to what s going on around him to notice all the shady sh t  comey just cleared that up with his testimony  pence knew  he knew and still allowed flynn to have access to our country s most sensitive information  and now  the american people know too watch comey shoot down pence s hopes of ever becoming president here  featured image via drew angerer getty images
