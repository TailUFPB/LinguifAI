when a fox news host tried to whine about the way the media has been covering donald trump  mark cuban dropped a truth bomb on him throughout this campaign  the republican nominee has said increasingly more bombastic statements  in fact  trump s rhetoric and behavior are totally unprecedented  which is why the media is covering him the way they do but trump has repeatedly complained about the media covering the things he has said and done  which is why he has been blaming them for his low poll numbers and is accusing them of rigging the election against him and fox host howard kurtz tried to push the trump line on sunday  only to be derailed by real billionaire mark cuban  the media coverage of trump in the last couple of months has been overwhelmingly negative   kurtz whined  but cuban was quick to point out that donald trump only has himself to blame for the way the media covers him  well  that s of his own making  isn t it  if you re going to say the things that he says  and if you re going to make the flippant comments that he makes  you re going to get covered  i mean  all he had to do was shut up nine out of ten times and the coverage would be distinctly different  that s just not something he s capable of doing  cuban is exactly right  donald trump did this to himself by simply opening his mouth and saying and doing things that he shouldn t  he just doesn t want to take responsibility for his words and behavior so he is making the media his scapegoat and his supporters believe him when kurtz complained that the media is hostile towards trump  cuban once again informed the fox host trump knew what he was getting into when he threw his hat into the presidential arena  look  on the way up  he was happy to ride the train  right  he bragged about media coverage  he was excited about it  he loved the live coverage of the primaries and early on the presidential race  it s a two edged sword  you know that  so if you re going to love it on the way up  you got to learn to deal with it  here s the video via youtube once again  mark cuban is spot on  donald trump has seen a lot of presidential elections in his lifetime so he should know that media coverage of presidential candidates is intense  and howard kurtz should know that the primary job of the media is to cover the candidates because that s what journalism is all about  it s not that the media s coverage of trump is negative  it s that trump has made himself and his campaign negative from the start and he has made no effort to tone it down so if trump wants the media to start covering him differently  he ll have to change first  and that probably won t happen any time soon featured image  screenshot
