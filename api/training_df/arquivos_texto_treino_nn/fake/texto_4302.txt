only a few days ago  it seemed as if donald trump could not make a gaffe big enough to end his campaign  then on friday  audio of trump from  was released in which trump makes violently misogynistic remarks regarding groping women  it s set his campaign into a tailspin and even his running mate  mike pence  is now calling out trump pence made his remarks in a statement saturday where he wrote   as a husband and father  i was offended by the words and actions described by donald trump in the eleven year old video released yesterday  i do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them  i am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the american people  we pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night  the beginning of pence s statement is reminiscent of a viral video post made by republican senator mike lee made after hearing the audio  except for the fact that lee went a step further and pleaded with trump to drop out of the race  two other republican senators have called for trump to drop out after hearing the audio  while the statement from pence is written in a manner that positions trump along the lines as a sinner who might still be capable of redemption  the word from insiders is that pence is absolutely furious with trump  wapo national political correspondent  philip rucker  recently tweeted that a source close to trump said that pence is  absolutely apoplectic  about trump s groping comments  a source close to trump camp told me pence and his team are  absolutely apoplectic    melting down  and  inconsolable   philip rucker   philiprucker  october    statement from pence provides more evidence that trump s campaign is in crisis  pence s position as trump s wing man is clear  pence is supposed to and has been making the case for trump to socially conservative christian republicans  an unfortunate position to be in at the present moment  there is no way to make a man who caused the entire nation to hear the word  pussy  on repeat in the news cycle be palatable to the moderate christian right wing  featured image from chip somodevilla getty images
