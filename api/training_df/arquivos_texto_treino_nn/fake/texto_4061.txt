these kinds of slaps on the wrist should get judges fired  period wesley dylan marshall is probably only going to serve  percent of a ridiculous  day jail sentence for what he did to a  year old woman this past july during a stay at the church hill motel with the woman and another man  marshall became angry and assaulted the woman by literally throwing her off the side of a balcony two stories high because she consented to having sex with the other man and not him in celebration of her birthday according to the kingsport times news aside from the jail time and anger management classes  marshall was sentenced to  months and  days of probation  ordered to serve  hours of community service  issued fines and fees totaling    and ordered to have no contact with the victim it all adds up to yet another light sentence for a white guy who committed violence against a woman  proving once again that the judicial system and the law does not go far enough to protect women from assholes like marshall judges across the country have disgraced themselves by sentencing rapists and abusers to light sentences in june  judge aaron persky sentenced rapist brock turner to only six months in jail  igniting a firestorm of criticism in august  colorado judge patrick butler gave a rapist zero prison time a massachusetts judge did the same thing during the same month and even gave the perpetrator permission to serve his probation in another state so he can attend college and a montana judge is facing impeachment for sentencing a man to just  days in jail for raping his own daughter this latest sentencing in tennessee is just adding to the pattern clearly  there are far too many judges in this country who have a frat boy attitude about the way white guys treat women and it s only getting worse featured image  raw story
