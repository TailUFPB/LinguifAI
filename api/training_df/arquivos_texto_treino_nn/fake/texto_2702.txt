fox news insulted president obama one last time by crediting donald trump for the good january jobs report every time a positive jobs report was released during president obama s eight years in office  fox news found something to criticize and even claimed that the numbers were being faked they desperately claimed that the economy was terrible under obama and refused to acknowledge that jobs were being created in this country at a record breaking pace never seen in this country before but on friday  fox news lavished praise upon trump and giddily discussed the january jobs report released this week that shows   new jobs were added to the economy last month fox   friends host heather nauert hailed the report as  the first jobs report under president trump  and called it  fantastic news  great news on the jobs front this morning   she added before letting everyone know that this is something trump can brag about here s the video via media matters this is absolutely hypocritical of fox news  prior to this report  president obama oversaw a record  consecutive months of job growth in the united states and fox refused to give obama credit for this incredible economic achievement  but they are perfectly willing to give trump all the credit in the world for a single jobs report and that jobs report is not trump s achievement  it s president obama s not only is fox news being hypocritical propagandists as usual  they are totally wrong about it according to media matters university of chicago economist austan goolsbee  a former chairman of president obama s council of economic advisors  pointed out that the  reference week  for the latest jobs data ran through january   meaning the entire report predates the trump administration by over a week  washington post reporter glenn kessler  who runs the paper s fact checking research  also noted that the report  still reflects the obama administration   fox also neglected to mention that the report marks  consecutive months of job growth   the longest on record   for obama in short  this jobs report should be credited to president obama  which means his streak of consecutive job growth now stands at  months media matters also pointed out that fox news whined about an even better jobs report in february  that showed   jobs were added  much better than the report issued this week  but fox chose to nitpick by complaining that unemployment had increased by   percent  which just so happens to be the same percentage increase in this january jobs report fox is praising as an economic victory for trump and that s not all in october of that year  fox   friends stumbled through a news alert in which a host claimed the economy created  only   jobs   last month  even though that report  like the data released today  also beat expectations  last january  fox s spin was to claim that   new jobs was  modest by historical standards   though it was well over this month s    and in april  the network parsed the jobs data to conclude that a report showing   new jobs was unimpressive because   of those were allegedly low quality retail positions   yet nauert made no such comment about the   retail jobs included in today s report  as election day drew near  fox   friends falsely claimed that steady jobs data for october  were  underwhelming  and spun the news as a boon for trump s presidential candidacy so fox news is literally changing the way they cover jobs reports  thus proving that they are trump s and the republican party s propaganda machine  this is what fake news actually looks like for  months  fox news trashed every positive jobs report to make it look like president obama was overseeing a weak economy  the fact is  however  that president obama is one of the strongest economic presidents in our nation s history featured image via myside s spew
