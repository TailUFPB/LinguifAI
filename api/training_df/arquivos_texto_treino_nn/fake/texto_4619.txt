if donald trump thought he was going to get away with calling the pastor of the black church he visited in flint  michigan a  nervous mess   he was dead wrong  pastor faith green timmons is a strong woman and rock in her community  she didn t let trump get away with trying to use her church as a platform to attack democratic nominee hillary clinton  and  as he always done when he feels embarrassed or attacked  trump went on fox news and trashed pastor green timmons  that isn t all  either   trump flat out lied about what happened while he was at the church and how his visit was received well  this pastor was the wrong one for trump to decide to start another one of his personal feuds with  refusing to sink to trump s pattern of low road insults when there is any sort of conflict whatsoever  pastor green timmons had this to say regarding trump s remarks and her interruption of his statements in her church  they had plans to make it a little more than they originally said  and i said   no  you re going to stick to the original plan  and so when he asked to come in to make a statement and the statement began to go beyond what he originally said  i asked him to stick to what he said  you came here to welcome our workers and thank them for what they have done and that s what he stuck to  so  in other words  trump wanted to do things his way  and he got shut down by a strong black lady pastor and he can t stand it  pastor green timmons continued  when i heard from the trump camp that they wanted to come by and see that we give out water  we give out foods that help mitigate lead and asked if he could come   all are welcome  it s a public event  then  pastor green timmons turned her attentions to some of trump s more bigoted and insulting statements regarding african americans and others  still  despite the horrible things trump has said  this lady continued to show class  i wanted him to see the best of flint in the sense that we re an educated congregation  some of the statements that i ve heard him make about african americans  mexicans and others were degrading  i wanted him to see intelligent people  loving people  caring people  who have done well with the resources that they had  exactly  trump speaks about minority communities in some of the most bigoted  ignorant  and insulting language imaginable  and this pastor just wanted to give him a chance to see some educated  thriving black people who are not out joining gangs and getting shot on every street corner  the thing is  though  trump will continue to hold on to his racist opinions  for he is incapable of changing them  it s too bad this pastor wasted her wisdom  time  and space on such a disgraceful person watch pastor green timmons speak below flint pastor rev  faith green timmons explains why she interrupted  realdonaldtrump speech  trumpinflint pic twitter com   cameron ridle   cameronridle  september    image via video screen capture
