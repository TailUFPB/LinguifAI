ivanka trump just proved that she doesn t support pay equality  and the internet damned her to hell for her hypocrisy during his presidency  president obama issued a set of rules designed to help end pay discrimination on the basis of gender and race the rules would have required employers to give pay data to the equal employment opportunity commission  such data would have been used as evidence of pay discrimination which could then be used to shape policies to end such practices but donald trump killed those rules this week and excused his action by claiming that they violate the paperwork reduction act  in short  trump used a bullshit excuse to hurt women and minorities  and gave employers the power to discriminate at will one would think that ivanka trump would be pissed about this  considering that she frequently claims to be a champion for equal pay  but  no in fact  daddy s little girl actually backed her dad s decision  ultimately  while i believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important  the proposed policy would not yield the intended results   ivanka said   we look forward to continuing to work with eeoc  omb  congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap  killing evidence gathering rules actually kills the very transparency trump claims is  important  once again  ivanka trump proves that when it comes right down to it  she is a hypocrite and is complicit ivanka s betrayal of women and minorities drew a sharp rebuke from twitter users  ivankatrump you re a sell out  so much for your bs about fighting for pay  gender  and racial equality  daddy s girl through and through   jenboudreau   jenboudreau  august    ivankatrump  ivankahq way to influence  realdonaldtrump on pay equality   complicit  unqualified  resign https   t co   angry dem     august    ivankatrump siding w racist sexist father on scrapping pay equality measures  shameful grifter  no end to their deceit  brian   brianandrewd  august        ivankatrump   wth  i thought you were leading the change for pay equality for women  do you have no sway with your father  https   t co   catenigma   catenigma  august    ivanka trump  at the risk of making her feel even less comfy in dc  lady  overturning wage transparency rules won t fix the pay gap  cate gormley   categee  august     hypocrite    liar  ivankatrump backs dad s plan  scrap rules preventing pay discrim n https   t co  for the resistance pic twitter com   proudly liberal   liberalproudly  august    much for your promises in your father helping women  thanks  ivankatrump https   t co   zach filzer   zacharyfilzer  august    them eat cake  ivanka backs trump administration s plan to scrap obama rules preventing pay discrimination https   t co   herbert   hhooversghost  august    she really cared about achieving pay equality  ivanka trump would have supported these rules  instead  she demonstrated that she is nothing more than a collaborator in her dad s sexist and racist administration featured image  sean gallup getty images
