by now  everyone has seen the monstrosity that is the gop senate s so called healthcare bill  at its core  it really is just a huge tax cut for the rich at the expense of the healthcare of poor  elderly  sick  and disabled americans  we have all watched how disabled members of adapt  a decades old disability rights organization that is largely responsible for the modern day americans with disabilities act  were dragged bodily from their wheelchairs and other medical devices from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell s  r ky  office  all for exercising their first amendment rights to protest the inhumane stripping of their life saving care we ve been talking about the political price of all of this for years  the gop is in power  and they are determined to do what they have been wanting to do for the last seven years  which is take the healthcare president barack obama gave the nation away  they want to repeal the affordable care act  also known as obamacare  however  what we haven t been talking about is the real effects of all of this on real people mike phillips appeared on msnbc s the last word with lawrence o donnell  with ari melber sitting in for lawrence  on friday night  mike had a pre typed statement  you see  he cannot move or speak  but he can move his fingers long enough to communicate via a computer  it takes a very long time  though  and thus his statement was pre written  his mother  karen  takes care of him full time  he also has a personal caregiver  many of these services are provided through medicaid  which the cruel gop massive tax cut for rich people healthcare bill cuts if this bill becomes law  mike and those like him and others living with all kinds of disabilities will be relegated to substandard nursing homes or institutions  mike s mother explained that there is no facility in florida  where they live  that is equipped to deal with mike s needs  therefore  not only would mike be ripped from his home and loved ones  he d have to be shipped away to some institution for people with severe disabilities in another state  where his family would either have to relocate  or he d be surrounded by strangers  completely helpless and unable to speak out if he is being neglected or mistreated one might ask the same question  karen  mike s mother asks in the video you are about to watch   how could this country treat its citizens this way  how could they harm and drag people from wheelchairs for standing up for their rights  how can they take healthcare from the most vulnerable among us i ll tell you how  it s because paul ryan and mitch mcconnell exist and they are in charge  that s how  paul ryan admitted that he has been dreaming of ripping medicaid to shreds since he was at college keggers  despite the fact that he used social security to get through college after his father died  he might have a pathological hatred of social programs now  but he wouldn t be where he is today without them  mitch mcconnell had polio as a child and grew up dirt poor  while he didn t get government care  he still recovered due to the kindness of strangers at a facility built by franklin delano roosevelt  in other words  without help  mcconnell would be poor  disabled  and likely in some kind of facility  however  thanks to this outside help  he somehow  made it   and has spent his entire career outrunning his past as a poor kid with a disability  he s still running  as his number one mission in life is to deny the type of kind  compassionate care he received in his hour of need to those in similar situations today  these two men don t care who they hurt along the way   they just want to prove that who they are now has nothing to do with how they grew up in other words  the two most powerful men in america are also the most dangerous to the most vulnerable americans  they are out to prove that folks who didn t or couldn t  pull themselves up by their bootstraps   or those who they believe are not properly contributing don t deserve to live and eat like the rest of us think the gop isn t heartless  watch the video below for your proof  thank you  mike and karen  for sharing your story  without further ado  here you are featured image via video screen capture
