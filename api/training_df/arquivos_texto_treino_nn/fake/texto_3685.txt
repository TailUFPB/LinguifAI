donald trump is a threat to the continuing survival of our nation and democracy  and the only thing that can stop him is the electoral college that s why harvard law professor lawrence lessig is openly calling upon the electoral college to save us from this abomination that has made a mockery of our constitution without even setting one foot inside the white house yet most americans would agree that the electoral college is an outdated part of our election that should be removed  but in this instance  it the last hope america has to keep trump and his racist minions from destroying our country in an op ed for the washington post  lessig points out that the founding fathers adopted the electoral college as an additional check on our elections to make sure that demagogues and con artists like donald trump don t get to be president hillary clinton currently has more than a  million vote lead over trump in the popular vote  which means the will of the american people has been trampled by an electoral system that republicans may very well have rigged this year  which is why jill stein has raised enough money to trigger a recount in three battleground states on december   the electors will meet to cast their votes for president and vice president  and when they do  they have a chance to put the rightful winner of the  election in the white house according to lessig  the electoral college  is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people  it is meant to be a circuit breaker   just in case the people go crazy  in this election  the people did not go crazy  the winner  by far  of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation  like her or not  no elector could have a good faith reason to vote against her because of her qualifications  choosing her is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the people  the framers left the electors free to choose  they should exercise that choice by leaving the election as the people decided it  in clinton s favor in short  electors need to do the right and moral thing and vote for hillary clinton  even if it means being fined for voting their conscience over  million americans have already signed a petition asking the electoral college to vote for clinton  fell free to sign it by clicking here these electors have a responsibility to keep our country from burning down to the ground  trump has already proven that he isn t taking the presidency seriously and that he intends put our government into the hands of people who want to destroy it lessig is right to ask the electors to switch their votes to clinton and the rest of us need to ask them to do it  too  we need to support them and tell them we have their back  sure  conservatives will bitch about it  but at this point  who really gives a shit about them anyway  they voted for a tyrant  therefore  their opinions no longer matter featured image  zach gibson getty images
