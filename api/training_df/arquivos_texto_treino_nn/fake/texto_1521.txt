just when you think you re starting to figure out what happened with james comey getting fired from the fbi  another tidbit of information comes out and turns the whole thing on its head once again in a new twist  donald trump knew that comey reported directly to attorney general jeff sessions and deputy attorney general rod j  rosenstein  so  in an effort to move things along with comey  he had them come to the white house according to the washington post  the president already had decided to fire comey  according to this person  but in the meeting  several white house officials said trump gave sessions and rosenstein a directive  to explain in writing the case against comey  and we all know what happened next  the memos were written by all parties and made public pretty fast  faster than comey could even become aware he was fired here s the thing  though  deputy ag rosenstein is pissed he s basically become the fall guy for trump wapo reports  rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the white house on tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire comey and that the president acted only on his recommendation  said the person close to the white house  who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter  you see  the narrative came out that comey went to the justice department only days before he was fired requesting  more prosecutors and other personnel to accelerate the bureau s investigation into russia s interference in the presidential election   and this request was made to rosenstein   whose memo was used to justify mr  comey s abrupt dismissal on tuesday  now that rosenstein is pissed  it s looking more and more likely that trump may have planned it this way and made rosenstein the fall guy for comey s removal the plot in this story of mayhem is definitely getting thicker and it will be interesting to see how things progress in the coming weeks and months featured photo by getty images
