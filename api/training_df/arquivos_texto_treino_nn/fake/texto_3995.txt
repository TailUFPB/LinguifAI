robert reich is one of the most respected voices in politics  he also has many friends who are current and former elected officials  he recently posted a most disturbing conversation he had with a friend who just happens to be a former gop congressman on facebook  and it exposes just how crazy the donald trump phenomenon is  and how much control trump and his crazy supporters have over the republican party  here is the transcript of that post yesterday i spoke with a former republican member of congress whom i ve known for years me  what do you think of your party s nominee for president he  trump is a maniac  he s a clear and present danger to america me  have you said publicly that you won t vote for him he  sheepishly   no me  why not he  i m a coward me  what do you mean he  i live in a state with a lot of trump voters  most republican officials do me  but you re a former official  you re not running for congress again  what are you afraid of he  i hate to admit it  but i m afraid of them  some of those trumpistas are out of their fu king minds me  you mean you re afraid for your own physical safety he  all it takes is one of them  you know me  wait a minute  isn t this how dictators and fascists have come to power in other nations  respected leaders don t dare take a stand he  at least i m no giuliani or gingrich or pence  i m not a trump enabler me  i ll give you that he  let me tell you something  most current and former republican members of congress are exactly like me  i talk with them  they think trump is deplorable  and they think giuliani and gingrich are almost as bad  but they re not gonna speak out  some don t want to end their political careers  most don t want to risk their lives  the trump crowd is just too dangerous  trump has whipped them up into a g ddamn frenzy and here is the embed this is what has happened to one of america s two major political parties  they have propped up a literal fascist and are currently doing all they can to put him in the oval office and give him control of the most dangerous nuclear arsenal in the world  that is frighteningly  chillingly irresponsible  if we all die  you know who to thank these people are cowards  and you cannot be a leader and a coward at the same time  they have no leadership skills  part of being a good leader is doing the right thing when it counts  and it s clear that the current gop leadership is incapable of doing that all i can hope is that the entire gop is just like reich s friend   and when they enter the privacy of the voting booth  they vote to save the world from that lunatic that somehow rose to the top of the gop presidential ticket  rather than voting to save their own political hides featured image via joe raedle getty images
