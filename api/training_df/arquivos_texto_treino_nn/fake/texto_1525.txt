democrats are taking action to keep donald trump away from documents related to the investigation of his possible collusion with russia to steal the presidential election  following the firing of fbi director james comey  top ranking members of the judiciary committee sent a letter to the justice department urging the fbi to retain all russia investigation documents and not share them with the trump administration  it was brazen  one of the most staggering  stunning acts of a president compromising an investigation   sen  richard blumenthal  said trump s decision to fire comey  the person who just happened to be investigating him  is being compared to richard nixon s saturday night massacre and democrats have called his actions  nixonian    mind boggling  and  a cover up  if there was any question about the need for a special prosecutor  there is none now   blumenthal said  they fired sally yates  they fired preet bharara  and now they fired director comey  the very man leading the investigation  this does not seem to be a coincidence  minority leader chuck schumer said  comey was scheduled to testify on thursday but what will happen now that he is no longer heading up the fbi remains to be seen  i doubt if he ll attend on thursday but it is still my strong desire to have now former director comey to come and testify before the committee   sen  mark warner said comey has indeed been invited to testify as a private citizen  although he has not yet accepted the offer  if he were to do so  and it was a closed door hearing  he would be free to provide much more information now that he is not the director of the fbi  and this could prove disastrous for trump hopefully  the fbi and the doj do as the democrats are asking and keep these vital documents pertaining to the russia investigation safe from not only the white house but attorney general jeff sessions as well  trump and his crooked cronies certainly aren t afraid of trying to make the evidence of their collusion disappear  they are in so deep that they will stop at nothing to escape the inevitable consequences that are coming featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
