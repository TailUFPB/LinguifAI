seriously  this actually just happened prior to a round table ass kissing contest  donald trump told a room full of reporters and his cabinet members that he has passed more legislation than any other president except franklin d  roosevelt  i will say that never has there been a president   with few exceptions  in the case of fdr he had a major depression to handle   who s passed more legislation  who s done more things than what we ve done   trump bragged   we ve achieved tremendous success  i think we ve been about as active as you can possibly be at a just about record setting pace  here s the video via politico unfortunately for trump  most of what he has signed is insignificant stuff that republicans have been easily able to get passed to make it seem like trump is getting things done  in reality  he s not as politico points out many of the bills trump has signed  such as designating buildings and appointing board members to the smithsonian  do not have a major  direct impact on americans  and trump s ambitious legislative agenda on tax reform and infrastructure is largely stalled nbc news further points out that one bill trump signed was a war memorial  and another encouraged americans to display the flag on a certain day none of these pieces of legislation actually do anything to help americans or improve our country  in short  it s not worth bragging about  the only reason trump is bragging about it is because he has nothing else to brag about and he wants to convince americans that he is succeeding  of course  trump won t mention that all of bills he has signed are insignificant trump s major legislative agenda has been a complete failure while past presidents have major legislative accomplishments on their records through the first  days trump also whined about democrats and accused them of being  obstructionists  here s the video via nbc the problem with this charge is that it s hypocritical and pathetic republicans control both the senate and the house  so blaming democrats for his own party s inability to get things passed in congress is nothing more than an excuse  and a bad one at that it s also hypocritical because republicans obstructed president obama for eight years  to expect democrats to all of a sudden play ball  especially when such a destructive and incompetent person is in charge of the white house  is ridiculous trump claimed that democrats would not even vote for the greatest healthcare bill in the world  he should put his money where his mouth is  just introduce a universal healthcare bill in congress and watch how fast democrats vote in favor of it  the problem is that trump s current healthcare bill is nowhere near the greatest  it strips healthcare from millions of people while giving massive tax breaks to wealthy people such as himself  it also raises the cost of healthcare and gives insurance companies the power to drop customers for a variety of reasons  including if a woman was raped this cabinet meeting was nothing more than blatant propaganda designed to stroke trump s ego and fool the american people into thinking he s great  it s disgraceful and the american people should be outraged featured image  screenshot
