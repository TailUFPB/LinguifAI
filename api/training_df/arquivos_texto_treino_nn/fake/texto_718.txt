donald trump s pick for communications director took an already vulgar administration down another notch or   in an interview with the new yorker  it sounded more like the ramblings of a low level mob hitman than of a harvard law grad who s been tapped to manage the message of the supposed leader of the free world  here are a few snippets  not suitable for most children  or for most adults  on chief of staff reince priebus  reince priebus   if you want to leak something   he ll be asked to resign very shortly  and reince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic  a paranoiac let me leak the fucking thing and see if i can cock block these people the way i cock blocked scaramucci for six months   on leakers  what i want to do is i want to fucking kill all the leakers and i want to get the president s agenda on track so we can succeed for the american people  on steve  whatever his job is  bannon  i m not steve bannon  i m not trying to suck my own cock  the interview  which would have made richard nixon blush  was potentially more than just obscene  it may have been a felony  in talking about leaks  he wants to  kill  all the leakers   one quote got the attention of the fbi  this is going to get cleaned up very shortly  o k    scaramucci said   because i nailed these guys  i ve got digital fingerprints on everything they ve done through the f b i  and the fucking department of justice  source  daily beastthere s just one problem  scaramucci doesn t actually work for the white house yet  he has no security clearance  he isn t supposed to have any digital fingerprints or any information from the fbi or the  fucking department of justice   if he does have that information  he s potentially in a lot of trouble  if an fbi agent turned over digital evidence demonstrating who did particular leaks  that would be wildly inappropriate   said ken white  a former federal prosecutor who now practices criminal defense and first amendment litigation   it could be illegal  it could be a felony depending on the nature of the evidence and how it was acquired  it would certainly be a flagrant breach of fbi protocol  of course  scaramucci is a trumpster  which means that as with any trump marriage  he and truth likely sleep in separate bedrooms  or  as white says  scaramucci s claim is just  dumbass popped collar chest bumping   which describes pretty much the entire trump fiasco of an administration featured image via mark wilson getty images
