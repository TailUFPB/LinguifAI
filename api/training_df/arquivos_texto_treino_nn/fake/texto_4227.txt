nobody with any brains has ever accused rush limbaugh of understanding pretty much anything at all  but his latest bout with doltishness just went way over the line  even for him  while whining up a storm about decaying sexual morality in this country  he tried to paint the left as hypocrites because we tolerate anything sexual as long as there s consent  when there s no consent  we send out the rape police  and apparently  this is a problem have you ever heard anything so completely asinine in your life  what people do in their bedrooms is their business  but all bets are off when there s no consent  sex must be consensual or it s rape  end of story  however  limbaugh actually sees that as evidence of major hypocrisy when it comes to trump s damning  hot mic  moment  where he admitted to sexually assaulting women  he said  you know what the magic word  the only thing that matters in american sexual mores today is  one thing  you can do anything  the left will promote and understand and tolerate anything  as long as there is one element  do you know what it is  consent  if there is consent on both or all three or all four  however many are involved in the sex act  it s perfectly fine  whatever it is  but if the left ever senses and smells that there s no consent in part of the equation then here come the rape police  but consent is the magic key to the left  listen to this vile  pathetic  diseased beer turd of a man below  because holy shit of course  this is also the man that said we would legalize rape if we could because we d just call it the civil rights act of   that s kind of odd  though  considering limbaugh is now jumping on us for sending out  the rape police  whenever we see instances of rape when he brought this up  he was discussing bathroom bills intended to keep transgender people out of the bathrooms that correspond with their identities  now  is being expanded  civil rights  gay marriage  civil rights  transgender bathroom rights  civil rights  whatever the left wants  except over here  rape has become a safety issue  sexual assault is a safety issue  but only when we re talking about people that limbaugh and his loyal fans hate  it s  just words  when donald trump brags about actually doing it put another way  these people are terrified of sexual predators posing as transgender people and invading women s public restrooms  despite the fact that there s no evidence this happens  however  their lord and savior  donald trump  can brag about actually assaulting women and he s  just saying words   no concern for the safety of women who encounter him at all hypocrisy  nobody s being hypocritical except the trump supporting right  and if limbaugh can t understand what consent is  and how lack of consent literally means sexual assault and rape  then it s going to take an iron crowbar to beat it into his brain featured image via bill pugliano getty images
