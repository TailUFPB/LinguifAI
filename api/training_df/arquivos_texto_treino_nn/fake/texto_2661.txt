just like donald trump  white house mouthpiece sean spicer can t handle being satirized on saturday night live melissa mccarthy delivered a devastatingly brilliant performance as spicer  who has embarrassed himself himself repeatedly during press briefings by attacking the media for accurately covering trump and his administration most infamously  spicer was sent out to lecture and shame the press the day after the inauguration about the accurate assessment of trump s crowd size on inauguration day  spicer claimed that the crowd at trump s ceremony was the largest in history and people around the world laughed because all the evidence shows that trump s crowd size was clearly one of the smallest spicer has also feuded with cnn during the briefings mccarthy did a fantastic job portraying spicer during a press briefing here s the video via youtube well  spicer was at the super bowl in houston on sunday and he was asked about the skit and let s just say that spicer is a snowflake who thinks saturday night live is being  mean  according to extra explaining that he d first heard about the sketch while leaving church sunday morning  spicer said his texts had been blowing up so much he thought there must be a national emergency spicer told  extra  exclusively he felt the impression was a little exaggerated  his advice was that mccarthy  needs to slow down on the gum chewing  way too many pieces in there   though he thought it was a really  funny  show  he felt that mccarthy  could dial back  a bit last night  alec baldwin was back as president trump as well  as for what he thought of alec s portrayal of the president  spicer had the same feelings as the leader of the free world  calling it  mean   spicer said   alec has gone from funny to mean  and that s unfortunate   snl  used to be really funny  there s a streak of meanness now that they ve crossed over to mean  seriously  trump and his team need to grow a thicker skin if they hope to make it through the next four years without ending up with high blood pressure spicer apparently doesn t realize that a little exaggeration mixed with truth is what makes great satire work  as for his claim that saturday night live is  mean   i don t remember spicer ever complaining about snl making fun of president obama  in fact  i don t recall him ever complaining about the many truly awful things republicans said about president obama over the last eight years in real life saturday night live is a comedy show  if trump and spicer can t handle being mocked  they should both resign because if they can t deal with comedians how are they going to handle it when world leaders criticize them  judging by their reaction to snl  not very well featured image via screenshot
