on wednesday  senator john mccain responded to white house press secretary s claim that the massively failed raid in yemen that left  civilians and a navy seal dead  didn t achieve its primary objective  and managed to recover copies of three videos that have been on youtube for about a decade  a  huge success  according to spicer  any criticism of the raid   which trump authorized over dinner without adequate planning  preparation  or backup after his staffers goaded him with claims that obama would not have the cajones to do it   is a  disservice  to the dead  the life of chief ryan owens was done in service to his country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information we received during that raid   spicer said   any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions he took  full stop   mccain disagrees  sen  mccain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media  only emboldens the enemy   trump tweeted  he s been losing so long he doesn t know how to win anymore  just look at the mess our country is in   bogged down in conflict all over the place  sen  mccain should not be talking about the

ryan died on a winning mission   according to general mattis   not a  failure    trump concluded triumphantly   time for the u s  to get smart and start winning again  it is probably past time for us to  get smart  and  start winning again   but it seems that we will need to wait four years for that  the raid killed about double the number of civilians as it did militants  the important  game changing intelligence recovered turned out to be decade old youtube videos  he missed his primary target  and yemen revoked our permission to conduct anti terrorism operations within their borders if this is  winning  in trump s america  it is time for all of us to be frightened  fortunately  the internet is here to let trump know what they think of his new  great america where losing is winning
