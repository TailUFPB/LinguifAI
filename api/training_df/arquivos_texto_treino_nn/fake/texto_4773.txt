republican national committee chairman reince priebus keeps trying to put lipstick on his pig of a presidential nominee  however  he is quickly learning that it just isn t working  reportedly  priebus had planned to use the rnc s twitter account to heap praise upon trump following his immigration speech  however  as we all know by now  the speech turned out to be a disaster it was full of nativist  hateful  anti immigrant rhetoric and renewed talk of so called  deportation forces   as well as language that re enforced the idea that immigrants are taking over the country and killing americans  in other words  it was nothing but piece after piece of red meat for his racist  ignorant  hateful base of already won white supporters  hell  he even had surrogates whose children had been killed by undocumented immigrants making the rounds in the news media the next day however  the speech backfired  so much  in fact that half of trump s hispanic outreach advisory board is either reconsidering or outright withdrawing their support  well  at least the ones who aren t afraid of  taco trucks on every corner    to that end  priebus was unable to do as he had planned and try and make trump s immigration speech look good and presidential to the american people when will reince priebus  paul ryan  and all the rest of the gop leadership learn  trump might have won that nomination fair and square  but that doesn t mean he is qualified for the job of president of the united states  donald trump is like a toddler that priebus and ryan and all the rest are trying to potty train   he ll do well and poop in his training pot here and there  but for the most part  he still takes his biggest dumps in his pull ups  and they have to clean it up well  there s no cleaning this one up  boys  trump s a racist demagogue  a charlatan who is unfit to hold the office he seeks  and nothing you tell the american people  nothing he reads from any teleprompter  can change that featured image via aaron p  bernstein getty images
