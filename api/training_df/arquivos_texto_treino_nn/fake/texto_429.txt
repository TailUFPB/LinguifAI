it s certainly no secret that jefferson beauregard sessions iii  a man named after both the president of the confederacy and the guy who actually started the civil war  is an unholy racist  like  he s so racist that the wife of dr  martin luther king  jr   actually delivered a letter to congress pleading with them not to confirm him as a u s  attorney  years ago so it s no surprise to find out that sessions was the driving force behind convincing donald trump to end daca  the temporary deferment program for undocumented immigrants that protects them from deportation if they came here as children  sessions sees no difference between an  illegal alien  who steals a car and one who may sit next to one of his  grandchildren in school one day so imbued with the essence of jeff sessions was the trump decision to boot nearly a million kids out of the country in less than a year s time that it was the ag himself who delivered the speech announcing it  and it was during that speech on tuesday that the former senator from alabama revealed the truth behind the decision to end daca  that despite the fact that even many republicans favor the basic protections that daca affords  it is racism that serves as the foundation for undoing it  from the speech  the effect of this unilateral executive amnesty  among other things  contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences  it also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens  this is a direct appeal to the racist tendencies of the americans who put donald trump in office number one  the  surge of unaccompanied minors  that sessions refers to began well before daca was implemented  to suggest otherwise is a dog whistle to right wing voters  a bbc report from  showed that the number of unaccompanied minors who were apprehended near the border increased from october  to march  by   over the same period in the previous year  daca was not implemented until june of   besides that  any who came after daca was announced wouldn t have qualified in the first place  you had to have been in the united states at the time of implementation to benefit from the executive order number two  sessions brings up the myth of the job stealing immigrant  the theory  again an appeal to racists  is ridiculous from the start  immigrants don t even look for the same jobs as native citizens  there is no evidence to support the claim that daca has had any effect on jobs   other than as a boost to our economy  in fact  with the job losses that will come as daca expires   something to the tune of   workers a month   employers stand to lose billions in training new employees  and the federal government will lose tens of billions in lost revenue and gdp but those facts don t jibe with the sessions narrative don t let the mini quarrel that trump and sessions got into earlier this year fool you  they both have a racist agenda  and this is the first major step in implementing it featured image via alex wong getty images
