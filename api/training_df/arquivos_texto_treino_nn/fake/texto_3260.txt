if this becomes a republican strategy across the country  the american people will suffer greatly maine voters approved state minimum wage increase to   an hour earlier this year by a  point margin  that s means the state government must honor the will of the people and punish any employer that doesn t comply with the law but governor paul lepage is opening the door for employers to openly ignore and defy the law  which sets a dangerous precedent that republicans will likely employ around the nation in order to get around the minimum wage laws they hate the strategy is simple  just don t enforce the law and let employers treat employees like slaves and that s what lepage is toying with as he tests his strategy out for the next month according to an announcement by the tea party governor from jan      when the new minimum wage law is scheduled to go into effect  and until jan      the department will not bring enforcement actions against any employer who fails to comply with the change in the tip credit or the minimum salary requirement for overtime exempt workers  employers are expected to follow the law and pay the minimum hourly wage of   in short  when the law takes effect on january   employers can ignore it at least until january   that is  unless lepage decides to extend the length of the time period  which he could do since he s an asshole and this could end up becoming a strategy used by other republicans in other states and even at the federal level since donald trump and the gop control the government  including the justice department and the labor department mainers for fair wages campaign manager amy halsted blasted lepage for defying the voters and every hardworking person who desperately needs the wage increase  governor lepage has now gone beyond ignoring the will of maine voters and is flat out encouraging employers to commit wage theft   she said   refusing to enforce the minimum wage law  and especially the increase in the base wage for tipped workers from    to   an hour  is a slap in the face to tens of thousands of mainers who are working hard and too often struggling to afford heat  food and medicine  but lepage doesn t care  in fact  he accused supporters of the minimum wage increase of  attempted murder  and said they should be put in prison  to me  when you go out and kill somebody  you go to jail   he said   well  this is attempted murder in my mind because it is pushing people to the brink of survival  you know what really pushes people to the brink of survival  not paying them enough to provide themselves with basic human needs like food  clothes  healthcare  and shelter  if anyone should be behind bars it s politicians like lepage and the greedy rich people who oppose raising the minimum wage at some point  you can only trod over the masses for so long before they snap  anger and desperation will boil over and the bottom line is that the working poor outnumber the wealthy few so they would be wise to take care of the people who work long hours for far less pay to help make them rich featured image  flickr
