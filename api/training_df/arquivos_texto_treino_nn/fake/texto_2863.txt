although most of america did not want donald trump to be the country s next president  many of us were holding on to hope that we might see an improved version of what we witnessed during the former reality tv star s presidential campaign  unfortunately  trump and his team are proving to be worse than we thought  and they re only churning out more fear mongering and lies during his first week in office new white house press secretary sean spicer has continuously been backing up trump s voter fraud claims since starting his new position  trump has been trying to convince america that millions of illegal immigrants voted in the  election  and spicer has doubled down on those comments recently  fortunately  the media has been on top of it  obviously frustrated at the lack of transparency from the new president  as spicer lied his ass off on national television  msnbc s katy tur fact checked him in real time  and it was pretty amazing  despite having zero actual evidence that voter fraud occurred  spicer said  i think there s been studies that came from pew in  that showed fourteen percent of people who voted were not citizens  there are other studies that have been presented to him  it s a belief he maintains the president does believe that  i think he s stated that before  and stated his concern of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence people have brought to him  here s what tur said as she fact checked spicer on air  we want to do a little bit of fact checking on that statement because the white house now is referring to the same research that the campaign had referred to  and the transition had referred to  one was a washington post commissioned study which the washington post itself debunked  and the other one was a pew study from   which is actually from   which said that approximately  million   one in every eight people are on voter registrations in the united states that no longer valid   and they are significantly inaccurate  listing people who had died in the past  obviously  on the voter rolls  it doesn t mention anything about undocumented immigrants  so their basis of evidence isn t quite correct at all  you can watch that brilliant moment below here s  katyturnbc with an instant fact check after spicer said trump believes millions voted illegally  based on studies and evidence  pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  january    is far from the only network to prove trump wrong  cnn  the media outlet that trump has dubbed  fake news   ran a headline that said  trump believes millions voted illegally  wh says   but provides no proof  hopefully  we re going to see more real time fact checking from the media  because trump and his team are the most dishonest administration we ve ever seen featured image by joe raedle via getty images
