donald trump and his administration have proven time and time again that they are incapable of performing even the most simple  basic tasks that only require basic human decency and manners  the latest gaffe in the white house demonstrates that even as trump s  day approaches  they still can t get their sh t together according to a white house aide and court spokeswoman  trump did not extend a formal invitation to the supreme court to have dinner at the white house on thursday  an initial report that was released early sunday stated that a dinner would take place  that evening  the president will have dinner with the justices of the supreme court  including his successfully confirmed nominee justice neil gorsuch  however  this changed just hours later  on sunday night  the dinner with the supreme court justices was taken off the agenda  the white house aide confirmed  an invitation was never extended  when white house press secretary sean spicer was questioned about the nixed dinner plans  spicer said trump s staffers  moved some things around  and perhaps the dinner might happen at a later time  spicer said  i think having a relationship and meeting with the supreme court at some point would be a great idea and something that we hope to have on the schedule at some point soon  trump s rude  disorganized cancellation is hardly the only issue with these tentative dinner plans  while former presidents have had dinner with supreme court justices before  trump s corrupt administration definitely raised some eyebrows when they first announced these dinner plans  democratic sen  brian schatz said it best  why would the supreme court agree to do this  i can think of no legitimate reason to dine with a litigant  no matter what trump does  he can t help but raise ethical concerns as his scandals and conflict of interests only mount up  trump s administration is not only the most incompetent  lazy  and disorganized  but it is the most corrupt and must be watched closely featured image via tom pennington   getty images
