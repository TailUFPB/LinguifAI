since donald trump won the electoral college vote  and even months before that   democrats have been focused on the fact that  intelligence agencies are all in agreement that russia interfered with our election through propaganda and through hacking of the democratic national committee server  that can t be true   say republicans   there s no evidence that russia tampered with the voting machines  as if that s the only form of election manipulation    say republicans  now there is evidence of exactly that  while we don t yet know that any votes were flipped during the election  the evidence now says that they were hacking voting machines a few months before the election according to an nsa document acquired by the intercept  russian military intelligence cyber attacked a u s  voting software supplier  using information gained in that attack to  launch a voter registration themed spear phishing campaign targeting u s  local government organizations  russian general staff main intelligence directorate actors   executed cyber espionage operations against a named u s  company in august   evidently to obtain information on elections related software and hardware solutions   the document states  the operation gave the hackers  persistent access  to the targeted computers  allowing them to  survey the victims for items of interest  source  newsweekthis happened in august  so at this time  the nsa says they don t know if russians actually interfered at the ballot boxes  but  according to a watchdog group called verified voting  russians very well could have prevented some people from voting  if someone has access to a state voter database  they can take malicious action by modifying or removing information   pamela smith  president of verified voting  told the intercept   this could affect whether someone has the ability to cast a regular ballot or be required to cast a  provisional  ballot   which would mean it has to be checked for their eligibility before it is included in the vote  and it may mean the voter has to jump through certain hoops such as proving their information to the election official before their eligibility is affirmed  not only are things not looking good for trump as subpoenas and possible criminal indictments are looming over an increasing number of people close to him  but this brings the legitimacy of the election back into focus  right now  it s unclear what will happen if it s proven that hillary clinton would have won the election  but it s becoming increasingly clear that trump does not belong there featured image via adam berry getty images
