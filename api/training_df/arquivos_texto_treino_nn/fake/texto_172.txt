hillary clinton is not shutting up and going away as some would like her to  now that she is a private citizen who has zero intention of running for office ever again  the former first lady  senator  secretary of state  and  democratic presidential nominee can speak her mind  and she did so in spectacular fashion at a dinner on saturday night for the human rights campaign  while speaking to the nation s largest lgbtqia rights organization  hillary turned her attentions to fox news  the network that seems obsessed with her  even though she is a private citizen  and their criminal orange poster boy is the one who is currently squatting in the white house  hillary said of fox  it does strike me that in the last few days at least  fox news seems to think that s where i live  in the white house  because they spend a disproportionate amount of their time talking about impeaching me  so  look  if they want to make a trade  i d be more than willing  i would have much preferred to have come to the dinner tonight from a slightly closer residence  that s a trade i d be all for   and millions of other americans feel the same way  the deeper issue here  though  is that fox  like the rest of the world  knows that an indictment is coming from special counsel robert mueller on monday  and they have no way to spin their way out of this one  so  what do they do instead  tell their brainwashed viewers that hillary clinton is the real criminal here  and that donald trump is being witch hunted by the  fake media   they whip those right wing nuts up into a frenzy  all so that they can keep them just the way they like them  angry  ignorant  and frightening of boogie men on the left who don t exist give  em hell  hillary  you ve earned that right watch the video below featured image via darren mccollester getty images
