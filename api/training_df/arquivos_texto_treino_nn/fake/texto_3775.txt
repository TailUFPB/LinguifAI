a teacher in maryland is apparently gunning for a chance to be donald trump s pick for secretary of education  on wednesday  the parent of a student at harlem park elementary school in baltimore posted a chilling video showing her son s instructor throwing a racist tantrum in the middle of class after the woman s son misbehaved in class   something that is common among children of all races   the pasty white teacher decided that the boy and his african american classmates were acting like a bunch of  n ggers  the teacher can be seen putting her hands on the woman s son as she ejects him from class   but it s what happened after that that has people up in arms  after the student leaves the room  the teacher does not stop screaming  as the she began to melt down  the students in the class started to laugh  this  of course did not go over well with their teacher  who informed them that they are  all getting zeroes for doing nothing   then she dropped the n bomb  you re idiots  do you wanna be a punk ass n gger who s going to get shot  you re stupid  learn something  be a man  the student who filmed the altercation ended the video at that point  but the classroom seems to have dissolved into chaos donald trump s kinda sorta election has done nothing but embolden racists like this  recently  a teacher made headlines for telling hispanic students trump would deport them  another informed black students they would be sent  back to africa  we can not let this become the new normal  unfortunately  we have a man who appoints white nationalists to high level positions assuming office in january  it s up to us to do something about this   because you can bet he and his administration won t  watch it happen below featured image via screengrab
