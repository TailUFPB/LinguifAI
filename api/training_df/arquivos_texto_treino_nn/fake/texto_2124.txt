programs that have kept hungry americans fed for decades are being slashed so donald trump can spend more money on the bloated military budget since   the united states has funded meals on wheels  a program that supports   community based senior nutrition organizations across the nation  over   million hungry americans  years of age and older directly benefit from the program and getting a meal in their bellies is not the only benefit meals on wheels provides according to a research study  the meals on wheels program improved mental health  specifically decreases in depression and anxietyimproved physical healthreduced likelihood of fallsreduced feelings of isolation and lonelinessless worry about being able to remain living at homeincreased feelings of safetya higher likelihood of eating healthybasically  meals on wheels volunteers serve as a check on the health and well being of vulnerable senior citizens  they ve literally saved lives but if trump has his way  millions of seniors are going to starve and lose all of the other benefits associated with meals on wheels trump is planning to gut the   billion community development block grant program  which includes meals on wheels as part of his heartless plan to increase defense spending  as we should all know  the united states spends more on defense than anyone else in the world and could cut spending in half and still be number one that defense spending includes   billion a year for israel  so while senior citizens are starving in america  israel will continue ripping off american taxpayers in their bid to commit genocide against muslims trump is also taking aim at the food for peace program  which is  a state department program that distributes food assistance in emergencies such as famine and natural disaster  and does some non emergency food relief  this particular program plays a critical role in american diplomacy because our humanitarian efforts help build american prestige and respect throughout the world by eliminating these programs  trump is clearly sending a message to everyone inside and outside our borders that he does not care whether you starve to death or not and that includes people who voted for trump  since trump won the vote of those  an older eight points in   looks like trump voters are getting screwed again meals on wheels is already struggling as it is to provide meals for the   million people they currently serve  but as meal on wheels explains  the senior citizen population is exploding and hunger is going to get worse the reality is  more than  million seniors in america struggle with hunger    million live in isolation and   million live in or near poverty  and  this problem will only become more serious as the senior population is projected to double by   families are spread out and elders are left behind  often as they struggle to remain able to take care of themselves that means trump is only making hunger in america worse by cutting this program  he should be ashamed of himself  and republicans should be ashamed as well  because they can t seriously call themselves  christians  and not support programs that feed the hungry featured image  spencer platt getty images
