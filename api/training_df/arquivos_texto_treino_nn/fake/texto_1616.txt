from the moment trump won the election  he was already bragging about how he was going to run again in   and win in a move that shows just how delusional trump truly is  the undeserving potus ignored the fact that his approval rating has reached a historic low by launching his first ad for his  bid  and in true trump fashion  the ad was one big embarrassing fail  as trump was forced to pull the ad over an obvious violation   it violated the ban that prevents active duty military members in uniform from participating in political stunts the washington post wrote  the initial version of the ad released by the campaign included a shot of trump shaking hands at his mar a lago estate with h r  mcmaster  his national security adviser  an updated version dropped the shot of mcmaster  who remains an active duty member of the army  and replaced it with trump visiting a business  campaign law expert larry noble also pointed this out it should be noted that trump pathetically celebrated inauguration day by filing for re election  probably to soothe himself after seeing those tiny crowds  this ad is the perfect embodiment of trump s sloppy administration   these people have no idea how to run the country  which trickles down to the most simple tasks from what we ve seen from trump himself  his white house doesn t really pay attention to detail or do their research first before going all in  trump s team has had to repeatedly correct themselves  and not even a simple campaign ad can go off without a hitch not even halfway through his first term  trump has already made his bid for re election a joke and displayed just how incompetent his entire team is  it s no wonder the majority of americans can t wait until this clown and the rest of his circus are out of the white house featured image via pool   getty images
