it seems like a lifetime since march     but thanks to a pretty significant bill signed that day  at least there are no lifetime caps on your health insurance anymore  in fact  there were so many rules and regulations inside obamacare that benefited consumers instead of insurers that the gop went absolutely insane trying to undo them  that s no small wonder  insurance companies gave republican candidates and conservative groups nearly  million dollars in the last election cycle of   alone but the one thing obamacare didn t do  couldn t do   was clamp down on premiums  not without changing the way the entire industry is regulated  the fact is  premiums have been skyrocketing for a long time  and for a simple reason  insurance companies know you need them more than they need you  in other words  because they can  but an interesting thing happened after the aca was signed  the rising cost of premiums slowed to less than half the growth rate they were undergoing during the bush years  why  because more people were getting insured republicans point to raw numbers and call it an increase that happened under obama  but the premium increase from  to  was much  much smaller than it would have been without the changes to the system that obamacare wrought  what will they point to now that premiums are on a fast track again  they won t point to republican policy or donald trump  but i will the kaiser family foundation  a non partisan  non profit health care think tank  has been studying premium growth for nearly  years  in fact  if you ve ever read stats on health care   who s insured  median cost  what might happen if various bills were passed   you were likely looking at kff data  and according to their latest study  there s a definitive reason that premiums are going up at the rate they re back to  because donald trump is sabotaging the aca trump s constant description of obamacare as  failing  is already unhelpful  but his threats to stop cost sharing subsidy payments are worse  and even worse than that  his persistent badgering of the gop congress to repeal obamacare entirely   even without a replacement plan   has insurance companies scrambling to figure out how to stay in business  if donald trump got his way  after all  the number of people without health insurance in america would double in a very short time  and if you don t have insurance  they don t have a customer so what s the effect of trump s sabotage  premiums are about to go through the roof  just by threatening to stop enforcing the individual mandate   the mechanism that makes obamacare even work   trump has caused insurers to request rate increases from regulators anywhere from   percent to  percent  and his threats to stop cost sharing payments bumps that startling figure up to  percent for years  republicans liked to point to any increase in premiums as the fault of obamacare  but premium growth slowed as america got used to the idea of a larger risk pool  and it hasn t started under obama in the first place  now we can point directly to the actions of donald trump as the reason premiums are once again on the rise featured image via joe raedle getty images
