cnn host anderson cooper s reactions to kellyanne conway throughout this interview are priceless after firing fbi director james comey on tuesday  the wicked witch of the white house made her return to the cable news circuit to spout more bullshit in defense of her mentally defective boss conway was repeatedly reminded that trump loved comey during the  campaign  but she repeatedly made an ass of herself by pretending that candidate trump no longer exists  as a candidate  donald trump praised james comey   cooper said   donald trump talked about this on the campaign all the time  all of sudden the white house is concerned about james comey s handling of hillary clinton s email  i think you re looking at the wrong set of facts here  anderson   conway bewilderingly replied   in other words you re going back to the campaign  this is the president of the united states  he acted decisively today  he acted at the direction of his deputy attorney general  he makes complete sense because he has lost confidence in the fbi director and he took the recommendation of rob rosenstein  the deputy attorney general who has been on the job for two weeks  cooper then proceeded to grill conway  that makes no sense   he fired back   he said one thing as candidate and now he s concerned as president  clearly  this white house is under investigation  the people around the president are under investigation  you would agree with that  yes  in defiance of the facts  conway disagreed and whined about people who are  obsessed  with russia  then she argued that since she s around trump and not under investigation that others cannot be  i m around the president   conway said   i m not under investigation  so that person doesn t exist anymore   cooper asked   candidate donald trump  that s a fictional character we are no longer allowed to refer to  we can only refer to the donald trump who exists today  conway accused cooper of being mean and claimed that trump fired comey because he  needs confidence in his fbi director and he doesn t have it  throughout the interview  cooper can be seen reacting to conway s most inane responses with facial expressions  at one point  he even rolled his eyes because of how ridiculous her answers were here s the video via youtube clearly  cnn wasted their time and ours by inviting conway on to spread trump s propaganda  the only thing saving this interview is copper s reactions to being gaslighted the only reason why trump fired comey is because the fbi is investigating his russia scandal  trump just impeded that investigation and obstructed justice by firing the man in charge of it  now trump will likely put someone in charge who will drop the investigation  this is exactly the kid of shady shit that richard nixon did in order to cover up his involvement in watergate  he resigned rather than face impeachment  trump should not only face impeachment  he should actually be impeached and put in prison featured image  screenshot
