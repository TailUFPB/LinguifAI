donald trump s allies would very much like the rnc to cover the legal costs of retaining attorneys amid the inquiries into whether the campaign colluded with the russian government during the  election  it appears  though  that the alleged president s reelection campaign has already paid a legal firm    and that was just two weeks before donald trump jr  s email scandal broke trump s reelection campaign  that s kind of funny considering that it s hard to determine if the former reality show star will last even a year in office at this point  paid    to the law offices of alan futerfas on june   according to a new filing with the federal election commission the daily beast reports on july   the new york times revealed the contents of a june  email exchange in which trump jr   through an associate  solicited damaging information about  election rival hillary clinton just a day earlier  he had enlisted the services of futerfas  who is best known for representing four of new york s major italian mob families  the announcement of the hire came not from the trump campaign but from the president s company  where trump jr  remains a trustee perhaps this is why the amateur president holds so many rallies even though he just got into office  donations pour in from his gullible supporters and now  his own fans are paying the legal fees   presumably for his son s scandal drip  drip  drip the trump campaign s fec filing shows significant expenditures on legal representation as it wades through scrutiny involving alleged russian meddling in the  election  as part of that investigation  the fbi is examining whether the trump campaign guided russian disinformation efforts aimed at key voting precincts the consulting firm owned by brad parscale  the former trump campaign digital director at the center of that controversy  received more than   million in payments from the campaign in the second quarter the name of the committee  donald j  trump for president  inc the trump campaign began paying don jr s lawyer about two weeks before the email story broke  per new fec filing pic twitter com   lachlan markay   lachlan  july    campaign is also paying the trump corp  for legal consulting  a new category of campaign to trump company payments as best i can tell pic twitter com   lachlan markay   lachlan  july    filing also shows that the campaign settled on a new vendor for legal consulting services  the trump corporation  so  it appears that trump is profiting from his own scandal  according to the filing  the campaign paid the company nearly    three days after its payment to futerfas trump claims to know nothing about the meeting his son took with a kremlin connected lawyer  that meeting was set up to get dirt on hillary clinton  jared kushner  trump s son in law  and his former campaign manager  paul manafort  attended the meeting at trump tower   others attended  including russians  junior keeps changing his story but it s all coming out in the wash  we re sure mr  mueller is taking notes and none of this looks suspicious at all  wink wink  photo by john moore getty images
