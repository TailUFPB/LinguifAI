long before presidential scandals were as serious as conflicts of interest and obstruction of justice  conservatives had to content themselves with bashing president obama over every small thing   however silly  naturally  those criticisms have come back to haunt them as their own new president s bull in a china shop approach to governance means he does every single thing conservatives once accused obama of doing but worse it s exposed the conservative media as a clown car overflowing with hypocrites  before fbi investigations and russian collusion  this is the sort of thing conservative reporters spent weeks endlessly covering even nearly a decade later  the comment section on sites like breitbart and infowars feature commenters who love to attack president obama for this supposed  bow   ironically  the fact that they can t think up anything better to criticize him for inadvertently highlights how relatively scandal free obama s presidency was that hasn t stopped fox news  the network seemed eager to smear obama during its coverage of trump s visit to the middle east  in an hilariously half baked  report  on  foreign policy  fox ran with this headline early into trump s saudi arabian visit  ugh that headline becomes extremely awkward when the latest video from trump s visit emerged  the man conservatives say is an alpha male leader gave a small curtsy after he was presented with a medal in saudi arabia unlike obama  trump didn t bow  he curtsied      pic twitter com   bluepixie     may    a bold presidential gesture  i m sure fox news will cover it with just as much seriousness as they had obama s trip to saudi arabia  right here s another angle  that s definitely a curtsy trump once criticized obama for bowing to foreign leaders  as is customary  trump curtsies instead  pic twitter com   mikel jollett   mikeljollett  may    trump s defense  he is uniquely susceptible to flattery  giving trump a medal or praising him are extremely easy ways to get him to do what you want  in saudi arabia s case  the small gold token seems to have been enough to compel trump to rubber stamp a   billion arms deal  including weapons obama had withheld from the saudis for fear they would be used in war crimes  and an additional    billion investment deal and trump got to get a shiny medal  a win win featured image via twitter
