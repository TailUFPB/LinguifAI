donald trump made became a household name in the  after pretending to write a book called  the art of the deal   after that  his reputation was sealed as a great negotiator   or so his followers thought that illusion was shattered on friday  though  after the senate failed to pass its latest attempt at repealing obamacare  despite trump s last minute appeal to john mccain  mccain became one of three republicans who are credited with killing the bill it turns out that the real deal maker in this scenario was our former vice president  joe biden called his friend and former colleague before the vote  former senator joe lieberman did the same while we don t know what trump said to mccain that apparently had no effect  one of the reasons it fell on deaf ears is trump s blatant insincerity  on the campaign trial  trump disparaged mccain  saying he preferred people who weren t captured   referring to the fact that mccain was captured by north vietnamese and held and tortured in a pow camp for    years before the vote  and after mccain had voted to let the vote go forward  trump tweeted that mccain was a hero biden s call may or may not have been the deciding factor in mccain s vote  but you can be sure it was more meaningful than trump s  biden  unlike trump  can be kind and diplomatic  even when there are political disagreements  biden is capable of emotional appeals  simply because he experiences empathy  something trump completely lacks  biden also has first hand experience with the kind of brain cancer for which mccain is currently undergoing treatment  he lost his son to it  you can be sure that biden  in his heartfelt way  helped convince mccain that no one should be denied treatment for such a cruel disease the post reported that biden had a more emotional discussion with mccain  reflecting on his son beau biden s death to the same brain cancer mccain was diagnosed with earlier this month  biden s son died in   two years after his initial diagnosis source  the hillwhatever or whoever convinced mccain to do the right thing  it s clear that trump s deal making abilities don t translate to d c  that s one small consolation for having a narcissistic madman at the helm of our country featured image via mark makela getty images
