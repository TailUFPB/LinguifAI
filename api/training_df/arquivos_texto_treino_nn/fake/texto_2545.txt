one of the guests at what trump calls the  winter white house    his private business in florida  really got to feel the privilege associated with being able to drop    on a membership fee to gain access to the president on saturday  guests were treated to quite a bit of excitement when a call came in that north korea had launched a missile and trump read over confidential documents in full view of everyone as his white supremacist staffers held their cell phones  flashlights on it so he could see properly at the dinner table richard deagazio  one of the rich guests who somehow gets access to the president simply by paying him money  posted about watching trump deal with the north korea news   complete with photos of trump reviewing information that is supposed to be secure but that s not all deagazio posted  he also snapped a photo with the guy whose job it is to carry the  nuclear football   now the existence of the  football  is  of course  not a national secret  hillary clinton  for example  warned us that it is dangerous to place something so dangerous in donald trump s care  but deagazio made sure our enemies know who has it  what he looks like  and what his name is  this is rick he carries the  football  the nuclear football  also known as the atomic football  the president s emergency satchel  the presidential emergency satchel  the button  the black box  or just the football  is a briefcase  the contents of which are to be used by the president of the united states to authorize a nuclear attack while away from fixed command centers  such as the white house situation room   he posted on facebook along with a photo of rick  whom he says is the man  all it costs is    and literally anyone is able to get within inches of access to our nuclear secrets   an interesting fact given the donald s constant stream of attacks on hillary clinton simply for using a private email server  this  of course  is a small matter when compared to trump s friends exposing details related to our national secrets on social media in real time i never want to hear about emails again  on the plus  we finally figured out what it takes for one of trump s rich white buddies to be willing to touch a black man featured image via facebook
