just remember  donald trump s campaign is supported by racists  and this is how they treat people of color police have been unjustly killing black people at an alarming rate  and that has caused a movement to rise in protest against it  black lives matter is making an effort to change the way police treat african americans across the nation  and that is making racists explode in rage because they cheer whenever a black person is killed in this country and they want the violence to continue so when san francisco  quarterback colin kaepernick chose to sit during the national anthem on friday night versus the green bay packers to protest police shootings of black people  the racists quickly attacked him by questioning his patriotism and calling him the n word  i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color   kaepernick told the press after the game   to me  this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way  there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder  and he is right  police officers who unjustly kill black people often go unpunished and are usually sent right back out into the streets to do it again  police departments are reluctant to do anything other than to put the offending officer on paid leave  prosecutors are reluctant to bring charges  and even if they do  grand juries usually let what most normal people call murder slide and let s make this clear  we are talking about officers who kill black people who are unarmed and don t resist  we are talking about officers who kill black people who run for their lives  we are talking about officers who kill black people even though suspects are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law  cops are not supposed to be executioners but racists believe that keeping police officers from shooting and killing black people is somehow a violation of their rights  so they viciously attacked kaepernick blatant disrespect doesn t work well for impacting change  feel free to find a country that supports you better   colin kaepernick  paul hoffman     august    welp  i guess my kaepernick jersey is going out with the next thrift store donations https   t co   holly nicholas   ilikerox  august    nigger colin kaepernick has a   contract to throw a fucking ball  yeah  blacks are so oppressed in america   adolfjoebiden    bidenshairplugz  august    colin kaepernick is  keepin it real  and gets the prestigious  nigger of the day  award overtaking will smith in hardcore nigger status   nate     august    should try the saudi national anthem  i bet colin     boycotting u s  muslims will stand erect https   t co      tarek fatah      tarekfatah  august    all of you faggot cucks worshiping nigger athletes like colin kaepernick are getting what you want  you want to be shit on  kill yourselves   mobi wan     august    course  americans have the freedom to not stand during the national anthem just like school children do not have to stand and recite the pledge of allegiance  that is their right as citizens of this country  many conservatives are claiming that kaepernick is disrespecting our veterans and their sacrifice  but that is not the case at all  our soldiers fight for all of our rights  which includes choosing not to stand during the national anthem  just because kaepernick is making a political statement using the platform he has been given doesn t mean he hates our troops if anything  kaepernick is walking in the footsteps of muhammad ali  whom conservatives were praising not too long ago when he passed away  the boxing legend also took a stand against rampant racism and oppression when he changed his name and refused to enter the service after being drafted for the vietnam war  white racists howled with rage then  too and kaepernick was taking a stand for others  not himself  so claiming that his multimillion dollar salary means people of color like him are not oppressed is bullshit  but the fact that racists attacked him in these ways prove that racism and oppression still exist in this country and that these racists are desperate to regain the white dominated racist america of the past and they are trying to do that by supporting donald trump s racist campaign for the presidency yet republicans still wonder why black people won t vote for them featured image via wikimedia
