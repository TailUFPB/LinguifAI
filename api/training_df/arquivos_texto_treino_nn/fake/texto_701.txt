donald trump s secretary of energy rick perry doesn t get a lot of respect  that s a good thing   he s kind of a dumbass  and by  kind of   i mean of course that he s the dumbest guy to come out of texas since his gubernatorial predecessor  george w  bush but there s obviously something about perry s aw shucks style that got him elected three times as governor of texas  the problem is  nobody but texans know what it is  that s why his two runs at the republican nomination for president have been so laughably short  but those efforts did earn him something in the end  an appointment to an office he said he wanted to abolish  by the guy that beat him by publicly commenting on how dumb he is   governorperry failed on the border  he should be forced to take an iq test before being allowed to enter the gop debate   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    s magnanimous gesture in handing perry the department of energy came with risks  what if ricky used it all up trying to tie his cowboy boots one sunday morning on his way to church  that fear  of course  is unfounded  because rick perry totally thought the doe meant he was in charge of our oil  you can see why his brain might go there  he s from texas  so he may have imagined himself the perfect selection as oilman in chief  maybe he was confused by terrifying phrases like  foreign energy  or  energy independence   which do indeed mean oil and gas the guy in charge of those is actually ryan zinke  head of the department of the interior  mr  zinke was interviewed recently by the magazine gq  and he had  um   nice  things to say about ol  rick secretary perry is a wonderful guy  i think he thought his department was more about energy than   science  mostly  it s science and  of course  they also have responsibility of our nuclear arsenal oops  rick perry is in charge of our nukes    well  at least zinke isn t too worried about it interior is the one that produces energy  we laugh a lot about it it s a good thing somebody s laughing  right featured image via alex wong getty images
