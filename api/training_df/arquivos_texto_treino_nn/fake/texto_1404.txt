earlier this week  audio surfaced of paul ryan and some of his republican cronies joking that donald trump is on vladimir putin s payroll  the speaker of the house is now both furious and scared shitless about what damaging information might be leaked next speaking to conservative talk radio host hugh hewitt  ryan said that being recorded and caught red handed is all new territory for him  i ve never seen anything like this   ryan said   there was somebody who taped a meeting a year ago where our majority leader cracked a joke and then they released the tape of that joke out just a few days ago and that s a pretty bizarre thing to happen  so obviously that s a cause of concern of ours  hewitt asked ryan if he thought evan mcmullin  a republican from utah who ran an independent campaign against trump  might be the one behind the leak  but ryan refused to comment on who he thinks could be responsible  i m not going to speculate on who it is   ryan said   that s the name that most people  you know  you hear about  mcmullin was present for the meeting because he was serving as a staffer for gop conference chair cathy mcmorris rodgers  r wa  at the time  who can also be heard chatting on the recording according to the washington post  mcmullin was not the one who leaked the tape  but mcmullin previously mentioned this exchange in an op ed he wrote for the new york times  suspect public comments like these led one senior republican leader to dolefully inform his peers that he thought mr  trump was on the kremlin s payroll  suggesting that mr  trump had been compromised by russian intelligence   mcmullin wrote  other leaders were surprised by their colleague s frank assessment  but did not dispute it  one thing is clear  ryan is scared  he has no idea what horrific comments may be made public next and i have a feeling that he has said quite a few things he really doesn t want anyone to hear featured image via mark wilson getty images
