republicans in hawaii punished the first female house minority leader for putting country before party prior to and after the election  state rep  beth fukumoto took a stand against donald trump  she criticized him for his treatment of women and minorities and refused to blindly follow trump criticism is a form of free speech  but fukumoto is now being punished for exercising her constitutional rights by her own party fukumoto served as the house minority leader of the republican party in the state legislature  but no longer holds that position after her party punished her for criticizing trump at the women s march last month  they told me they would keep me in this position if i would commit to not disagreeing with our president for the remainder of his term   fukumoto explained during a speech on the house floor   mr  speaker  i m being removed because i refused to make that commitment  because i believe it s our job as americans and as leaders in this body to criticize power when power is wrong  indeed  dissent is an american value  especially when the president is acting like petulant child tyrant fukumoto was told by a republican colleague that as house minority leader  her first duty should be to the party  you are speaking not for yourself anymore   rep  bob mcdermott responded   it is a high level responsibility  and he is totally wrong the first duty of any american in public office is to the country and the people  not the interests of the party  putting party and power first is selfish and blinds lawmakers to seeing what is best for the nation mcdermott repeatedly argued with other republican women in the state legislature and fukumoto was replaced as house minority leader by a male lawmaker fukumoto told khon that she expressed her concerns about trump during the women s march the day after the inauguration  the republican party is getting increasingly hostile to different opinions  if you followed what happened at the state convention  i got booed for about  minutes straight for raising concerns about president trump  then nominee trump  and the way he treated women and minorities in many of his remarks  i  at the time  had said this is not  this should not reflect our party i repeated those sentiments at the women s march last week and since then  there have been many calls for my resignation  and my caucus members have raised concerns about whether or not that means i m a republican  whether or not that means i m fit for leadership  whether or not that means i should even be an elected official  my caucus has asked me to stop speaking out about trump and to make a commitment  they ve said they ll keep me as minority leader if i make a commitment not to speak out against trump for the remainder of his term  i don t think that s our job as elected officials  even more so  i don t think that s our job as citizens  so fukumoto is now reaching out to her constituents asking them if they would be okay with her joining the democratic party here s the video via khon fukumoto should not have been punished for criticizing donald trump  but republicans increasingly believe that anyone who criticizes them and their policies should be punished  the constitution be damned the fact that republicans replaced fukumoto with a man speaks volumes about how much republicans value women and it s an insult that should be answered with protests and a landslide victory for democrats at the ballot box for generations until republican learn to respect women  the country  and the constitution that they claim to hold so dear featured image  youtube
