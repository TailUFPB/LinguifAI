on thursday  the national association of medicaid directors sent congress a devastating letter about their planned overhaul of american healthcare  the namd is an organization comprised of quite literally every single medicaid chief in the country  and any statement issued by the entirety of its body is a rare thing  ironically  the trump era seems to have ushered in more than one situation in which there is unanimity in opposition to his policies and positions medicaid directors are appointed by state governors  which means that the office is filled by partisan picks  fully  of the  states  in fact  have republican governors  so the joint statement isn t just bipartisan   it s almost hyper partisan that makes this sharp criticism of the graham cassidy bill even more poignant breaking  the bipartisan medicaid directors from all  states just issued this negative statement about graham cassidy big  very unusual  pic twitter com   andy slavitt   aslavitt  september    tweet is clickable  and each image in the tweet is clickable  but here are the important parts  in case you don t feel like popping over to twitter  the bill makes some major changes to medicaid funding  including a massive transfer of funds from  blue  states to  red  states  and a transition to  block grants  that do not account for increased membership in medicaid programs  that is to say  states would get the same fixed amount of money no matter how many people signed up  making states with high membership among those with the lowest per patient allowance  taken together  the per capita caps and the envisioned block grant would constitute the largest intergovernmental transfer of financial risk from the federal government to the states in our country s history  the scope of this work  and the resources required to support state planning and implementation activities  cannot be overstated  states will need to develop overall strategies  invest in infrastructure development  systems changes  provider and managed care plan contracting  and perform a host of other activities  the vast majority of states will not be able to do so within the two year timeframe envisioned here  especially considering the apparent lack of federal funding in the bill to support these critical activities  with only a few legislative days left for the entire process to conclude  there clearly is not sufficient time for policymakers  governors  medicaid directors  or other critical stakeholders to engage in the thoughtful deliberation necessary to ensure successful long term reforms  the mostly republican board of medicaid directors also took the gop to task for trying to pass this bill before getting a score from the non partisan congressional budget office  usually  that s the minimum a bill must have to even be considered for a vote  but republicans are attempting to pass this bill before the end of the month  since that s the cutoff for them to do so with a simple majority  the senate parliamentarian ruled that budget reconciliation  the process by which bills can be passed with a simple majority  expires at the end of fiscal year   after september  votes will once again be subject to filibusters  meaning republicans will need to muster  votes for anything they want to pass  unless they take donald trump s advice and invoke the  nuclear option  in the senate that s unlikely to happen  and republicans are more desperate than ever for a win in congress  that makes graham cassidy a real danger to the future of american healthcare  despite this damning letter from the namd  and despite the massive opposition to the bill by every medical association  most states  nearly all consumers  and even some republicans buckle up  my friends  this could get ugly featured image via alex wong getty images
