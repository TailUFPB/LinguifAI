while donald trump has been taking vacations  special counsel robert mueller has been working hard on the russia investigation  instead of golfing this weekend  we suggest that the former reality show star huddle with his lawyers  trump s former national security adviser michael flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about conversations with the russian ambassador and he s fully cooperating with mueller  as part of the plea deal  flynn admitted that he was directed by a senior member of the trump transition team to make contact with russian officials in december  in addition  flynn is prepared to testify that trump as a candidate  ordered him to make contacts with the russians this marks the first instance of solid proof that there was collusion between team trump and a hostile foreign government on friday  just after the news broke  the white house insisted that flynn s guilty plea will not implicate trump or anyone else in the white house the white house said in a statement that flynn was fired for making false statements to trump officials  and that he worked for the administration for a short time   and that he was a former obama administration official  the false statements involved mirror the false statements to white house officials which resulted in his resignation in february of this year   said white house lawyer ty cobb   nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than mr  flynn  the white house then referred to flynn as the  former national security advisor at the white house for  days  as well as  a former obama administration official  however  the white house left out a few important details  president obama fired flynn as head of the defense intelligence agency and he also warned trump about flynn during a discussion two days after the election and emphasized that he had concerns about him joining the national security team for the new president on top of that  just after flynn was forced to resign  trump called him a  wonderful man  who was treated unfairly by the media photo by david becker getty images
