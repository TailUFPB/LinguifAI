if donald trump continues to travel to mar a lago in florida at the current pace  he ll spend more taxpayer dollars on vacations than president obama ever did throughout president obama s eight years in office  conservatives constantly complained every time he went on vacation or played golf  they whined that it was a waste of money and that obama was lazy in total  president obama took  vacations spanning  days  which cost a total of   million it should be noted that despite conservative bitching  president obama took less vacation days than his republican predecessor  george w  bush took  vacations spanning over  days and donald trump is going to surpass both of them very quickly only days after the election  trump indicated that he intends to spend most of his weekends at his mar a lago estate in palm beach  florida where he also has a golf course  he also wants to spend lots of time at trump tower in new york and his golf course in new jersey trump has already taken three trips to mar a lago since taking office four weeks ago and those three trips alone cost taxpayers   million assuming that trump keeps up this routine and pace  he will end up taking  trips to mar a lago in  at a whopping cost of   million to taxpayers  which means trump will outspend president obama within a single year  furthermore  trump would easily surpass obama s number of vacation days  at the current pace  he would end up taking  vacations days in four years  and that s not counting other vacations trump may end up taking  if he starts going to florida every weekend he would surpass  days  and if he plays golf every time he goes to mar a lago he will have played more rounds of golf in two years than than president obama did during his first term if trump does this every year  the cost to taxpayers will be a monstrous   million after four years  that s right  over half a billion dollars trump supporters and conservatives will argue that trump is working during his vacations  but president obama worked during his vacations  too  yet conservatives never stopped whining about his vacations and just because trump might be working a little during his vacations  it doesn t justify the cost to taxpayers  and with all the chaos trump is causing across the nation and around the world  he shouldn t be going on vacation at all right now russia is getting more aggressive  north korea is firing missiles  america is on course for a major confrontation with china  millions of americans are about to lose their healthcare  immigrants are being rounded up  and america s creditors are dumping us because trump has made investment here too much of a risk  chaos and infighting plague the white house  yet trump is going on lavish vacations to his florida estate on the taxpayer s dime while he makes everyone else suffer it s outrageous and conservatives are hypocrites if they defend trump featured image via ian macnicol getty images
