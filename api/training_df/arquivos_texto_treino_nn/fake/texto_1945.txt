when one votes for someone with a  d  next to their name  we expect certain things  namely  in these troubling political times  that they will oppose the bigoted and disturbingly authoritarian trump agenda at every turn  the problem is  though  that there are democrats sitting in congress right now who are acting more like republicans than democrats  the most infamous of such figures is one senator joe manchin  dino wv   we ve already reported on how manchin is a complete turncoat who should simply turn in his  d  for an  r  and stop fooling his voters into thinking he s some kind of liberal  because he isn t  manchin is anti gay  anti choice  pro gun  and pro coal  therefore  he is certainly no democrat in the modern sense of the word  and it should come as no surprise that he is one of two dinos in the senate who has announced that he will vote for the supreme court nominee to fill the seat that the obstructionist republicans stole from president obama  the other turncoat on this issue is heidi heitkamp  d  nd  the hill reports that heitcamp says of trump s supreme court pick neil gorsuch  after doing my due diligence by meeting with judge gorsuch and reviewing his record and testimony before the senate judiciary committee  i ve decided to vote in favor of his confirmation  heitcamp went on to say that gorsuch is balanced  meticulous  and  well respected jurist who understands the rule of law  she obviously coordinated with manchin to make this traitorous announcement  as it came just minutes after manchin said of his own voting in favor of gorsuch via twitter  i will vote to confirm judge neil gorsuch to be the ninth justice on the supreme court  luckily  there is already an organization that is actively working to deal with dinos like manchin and heitkamp  called we will replace you  the group is making sure to primary  democrats  who refuse to oppose the trump agenda and his disastrous nominees  while any democrat is better than a republican  these people need to stick to their guns and do what is right  not what they are being pressured to do by the trump white house  the red state voters  and the republicans in congress  if they refuse to do their jobs on behalf of the democrats who put them in congress  they should be primaried   and if the good people at we will replace you have their way  all of these  democrats  who are voting across the aisle will be primaried in  remember folks   there are plenty of people hiding behind a  d  who are in no way democrats  look at the candidate  not the party label  and  resist featured image via justin sullivan getty images
