donald trump is already running for re election  with a campaign fund set up and everything  and just as he did with his  campaign  he s using the campaign to funnel money into his wallet via his businesses  because why patronize anybody else  and pay them all those campaign donations  when you can just pay yourself with them thus far  that amount totals        alone has gone to trump tower     plus has gone to the trump international golf club in florida  and nearly    has gone to trump s las vegas hotel  the rest has gone to various other properties federal election law requires any candidate who uses their own business for campaign purposes to reimburse said business for the market value of the goods or services used  generally  this winds up being a whole one to two percent of total campaign expenditures  as of june   trump s expenditures at his own properties was more than   million  or  percent of his total campaign expenditures by the nov   election  that amount was over   million that part of election law actually forms a loophole that trump has no problem taking advantage of to the fullest extent he can obama stopped fundraising for awhile following his election in   trump never did  as soon as he was elected  he and the rnc began fundraising for   and thus far  they ve raised more than   million together  trump s refusal to divest himself from his businesses means some of that money could very easily be literally going into his wallet as we speak given that this is probably the least transparent administration in a long time  there s no way to trust that this is all trump will funnel into his pockets  he s a master at exploiting loopholes in the law  his supporters will probably chant   there s nothing illegal about this  so shut up   but legal doesn t mean right or ethical the fact that he s already busy funneling campaign donations to his own pockets just adds to the growing stack of items illustrating just how unethical he really is featured image by alex wong via getty images
