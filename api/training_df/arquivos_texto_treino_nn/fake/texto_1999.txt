when republicans celebrated donald trump s undeserved election victory  they probably never imagined he d damage the party as badly as he already has in just nine weeks this week  trump once again embarrassed the gop by messing up their first attempt to repeal and replace obamacare  not only did trump fail to sell the disastrous american health care act  but he pulled the bill on friday  understandably  republicans are pissed that trump conducted things this way  and are distancing themselves from him more than ever  in fact  they re blaming him and saying that he and the white house had been an obstacle from the start  setting them up for failure  one house republican  who wanted to remain anonymous  said  their heart was not in the healthcare battle  think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban  or on the wiretapping claims  he certainly checked the boxes on healthcare  to his credit  but it s self evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this  trump and his minions have countered this claim  with press secretary sean spicer issuing a statement on saturday  the president and vice president left everything on the field  they were making calls and having members to the white house all week  in total  we spoke or met with over  members of congress  and yet  this doesn t seem to add up  considering that trump s daughter ivanka and son in law jared kushner were nowhere to be found as sh t was hitting the fan on friday  kushner  who is one of trump s key advisors  was actually skiing with ivanka in aspen as house republicans tried to pass their horrible health care bill and failed  and it s not just kushner they re pissed at   it s trump himself according to house staffers and other gopers  trump didn t seem focused when in meetings concerning the obamacare repeal  another unnamed republican said  halfway through that meeting  he stopped to talk about gorsuch  his mind was bouncing around  i never felt they were dialed into this  maybe next time the gop will think twice about letting a five year old become their party s nominee  what we re witnessing here is the breakdown of the republican party  and it s so humiliating that we almost feel bad for them  almost featured image is a screenshot
