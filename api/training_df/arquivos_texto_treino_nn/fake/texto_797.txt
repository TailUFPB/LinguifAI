it s been a rough day in the donald trump white house  after a mostly incoherent interview published in the new york times  and after a revelation that trump is going around asking if he could pardon his family and even himself  rats have begun abandoning the sinking ship it started early on friday morning  when trump s beleaguered press secretary  sean spicer  announced his resignation because he objected to his new boss  anthony scaramucci  the shakeup had only begun  by the afternoon  trump s personal lawyer marc kasowitz  also resigned after being demoted from heading the russia defense and after  in the new york times interview  trump threatened special counsel robert mueller against going after trump family finances in an interview with msnbc  times reporter peter baker said this about trump s legal team  people around him definitely are  this is  in fact  connected to the other thing you were talking about  the sort of blowup of the legal team  some of the lawyers told him don t go after robert mueller  first of all  this guy is a good guy  he is a smart guy  a person of integrity  in fact  some of the lawyers have said to the president  in effect  if you didn t do anything wrong and we think you don t have anything to worry about in terms of the russia investigation  then you should want robert mueller at your special counsel  because if he finds that  if that s his conclusion  it will have credibility on both sides of the aisle  so don t do that  baker was proven right on friday when kasowitz left the team after it was announced that ty cobb would be heading the defense this also points to a change in legal strategy  and that means that mueller  if not outright fired  will be in the crosshairs  the goal will be to dig up any bit of dirt and any perceived conflict of interest to discredit him  all of that points to just one thing   guilt  if trump  his family and his associates were innocent  they would  as his legal team said  welcome the investigation and discrediting mueller would only put a cloud over any sort of exoneration  now there s no question  we can be sure now that there won t be an exoneration featured image via pool getty images
