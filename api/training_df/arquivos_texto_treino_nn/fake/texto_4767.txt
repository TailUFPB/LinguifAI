two previously nonpartisan generals have broken a decades long tradition of keeping their votes private  in what is likely to be yet another nail in the gop s coffin this election cycle  time magazine reports two four star generals  bob sennewald  former commanding general of the u s  army forces command and david maddox  former commander in chief of the u s  army europe  announced their endorsement on thursday  our votes have always been private  and neither of us has ever previously lent his name or voice to a presidential candidate   they said in a joint statement   having studied what is at stake for this country and the alternatives we have now  we see only one viable leader  and will be voting this november for secretary hillary clinton  this is a victory for hillary  as both campaigns focus on courting the military vote  american legion  the largest veterans organization in the united states  held their convention last week  both candidates gave speeches and pandered as best as they could  trump s speech had some creepy fascist undertones   but with key differences  supporters of trump praised his  forcefulness  and  presence   whereas hillary supporters applauded her for actual plans and substance this actually serves very well as an example to illustrate the primary differences between the candidates as a whole  and while trump likely enjoys a massive lead among most active duty troops  that pattern does not hold true everywhere   intelligence officials  national security advisers  and military leadership all seem to favor hillary the reason is simple  trump is not competent  there is emotional appeal in his charisma and presence that apparently strikes a chord with some people  but for the half of the nation that prefers thought before action  it s simply not enough  hillary has the experience  knowledge  and basic competency to get the job done  which trump entirely lacks  for strategic thinkers worried about the future of our nation  the choice could not be any more clear here s the entirety of hillary s speech to the american legion  courtesy of pbs featured image via scott eisen getty images
