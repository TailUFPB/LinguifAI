former speaker newt gingrich is convinced that  somebody  is most likely going to wind up in jail when the investigation into russia s interference in our election is done  but he doesn t think donald trump will be the one who ends up behind bars  they re going to get somebody  i don t think they re going to get the president  but they re going to get somebody  and they re going to get him for something  and they re probably going to go to jail   gingrich told fox news on friday according to gingrich  what is playing out right now in the u s  is no different than an old  western movie  this is like watching an old fashioned western movie  this is an indian hunting party   gingrich said   they re out looking for a couple scalps  and they re not going to go home until they get some  special counsel robert mueller was already investigating russia s election meddling and the possibility  or more correctly  the probability  that trump s campaign was in collusion with the kremlin  but on wednesday  following the bombshell testimony of fired fbi director james comey  it was announced that mueller is also investigating trump for obstruction of justice so far  mueller has reportedly brought in  lawyers to assist with the investigation and intends to hire even more  gingrich said this is a sure sign that somebody is going to have to take the fall  mueller simply has too many  high powered  attorneys to just go home  without a scalp   somebody is going to have to go down  gingrich insisted earlier in the day on friday  gingrich had tried to claim that it is impossible for a sitting president to obstruct justice  therefore  trump is innocent  apparently  he forgot that as a member of congress he voted to impeach bill clinton for obstruction of justice watch featured image via t j  kirkpatrick getty images
