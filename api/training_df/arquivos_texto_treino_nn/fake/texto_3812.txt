despite the fact that donald trump received fewer votes than his opponent  hillary clinton  he s the victor from tuesday s election and his supporters aren t handling it well  the worst have behaved deplorably  with hate crimes on the rise  you ve probably seen the less violent trump supporters on social media  where they have been smug and sometimes verbally abusive  the takeaway  though  at least to them  is that there is still only one group of voters who matter in this country  and that s the white working class  the rest  according to trump voters  should just bow down this was the sort of behavior on display on sunday s this week with george stephanopoulos  where the guests included right wing shill mary matalin and liberal icon van jones  needless to say  jones didn t let matalin go far with her condescending and downright insulting whitesplaining after the election  jones emotionally called the election what it was   whitelash   here it is the right  who could have chosen the magnanimous route and addressed jones  concerns  instead chose to belittle him  matalin did just that by telling him how  as a successful and educated black man  he should ignore racism and simply tell his fellow african americans that they too should bow to the white working class  here s the transcript and video via media matters mary matalin  van has  to my mind  retracted your whitelash with what you just said   no  that we have to not focus totally on the toxic stuff   ok  but you should  and if you don t you re wrong  you are not   that s not the path for progressives  we ve all agreed at the outset of this show that the path  which is ellison s message  you say  is to go back to the rust belt and the rednecks   you re not going to get there with climate change and putin and all the rest of  jones  now listen  i said and stand by it  i said that race was a part and there was a part  that alt right part  it was a part of a whitelash  if you listened to the whole quote you would agree with what i said  so i don t take that back  matalin  i did listen and you said  what do i tell the kids   what i would tell your kids   i m a black man in america who went to yale  who s written books  who served a president and now  jones  and i m a ninth generation american man and i m the first one in my family born with all my rights  i m a ninth generation american  and so we have not escaped  because i went to yale  all the problems of this country matalin went on to say that jones should be a racial reconciler  not a polemicist  that s when jones very politely and very quietly lost it jones  you should be ashamed of yourself for attempting to say that to my face  i have spent more time  matalin  would i say it behind your back would be better jones  i spent more time than you have trying to be a racial reconciler in this country matalin  really  how do you know that  do you know anything about me jones  apparently you don t know anything about me here s the video trump voters need to know a few things  first off  only about a quarter of americans voted for their candidate  secondly  his election does not give them the moral high ground  and they certainly have not behaved well enough to lecture us on our behavior  not that they ll listen to me  the implication with trump s election is that for the next four years  discussions of racism and inequality are off the table  that s frightening  any progress we ve made over the last several decades will go up in smoke if van jones were any less a man  he probably would have lost his temper  and really  who could blame him  instead  he handled being whitesplained to with class and elegance  that s so much more than trump voters have shown him or the rest of us featured image via video screen capture
