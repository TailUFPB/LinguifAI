if there s one thing anyone needs to know about the first family  it s don t f  k with michelle obama  and really don t go after her man  which is a lesson donald trump has yet to learn responding to the debate and the topic of president obama s birth certificate where trump seemed rather proud of himself for obama revealing it  even though he continued pressing the topic  michelle obama struck back she said  there are those who question and continue to question for the past eight years  whether my husband was even born in this country  and let me say  hurtful  deceitful questions deliberately designed to undermine his presidency  questions that can not be blamed on others or swept under the rug by an insincere sentence uttered at a press conference  then  visibly angry and insulted  she says  let me take a moment  she then continued  but during his time in office  i think barack has answered this questions with the example he set and the dignity he s shown by going high when they go low  which is exactly what the obama s have always done because they are the epitome of class and grace that we should all aspire to be watch michelle go after trump here  michelle obama on birther claims  pres  obama showed dignity  by going high when they go low  https   t co vhfccpkhba  cnn   cnn  september    image via video screen capture
