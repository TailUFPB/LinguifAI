the new york times recently published a bombshell story about the culture of sexual harassment at fox news  and their star host  bill o reilly  is at the center of it  the times story says that o reilly and fox news paid five women more than   million in hush money who accused o reilly of sexually harassing them  as a result  more than  important advertisers have pulled out of advertising their goods on the o reilly factor in fact  so many ads have been pulled that thursday s show included almost no ads at all  and certainly none from nationally recognized brands  seemingly  as a result of all of these companies running as far and fast as they can from the public relations nightmare that is bill o reilly  the thursday night edition of o reilly s show was bizarrely cut short there was no explanation for the abrupt ending to o reilly s broadcast  the show usually lasts an hour  but was only on for  minutes  throughout the show  o reilly had kept promising a funny segment with jesse waters  who usually goes out and talks to people on the street in a mean spirited segment meant to embarrass people and make them look bad on the air  that segment never came instead of the waters segment  at the end of o reilly s strangely short show  fellow fox anchor shep smith spent the extra  minutes reporting on the goings on in syria  this was prior to the world knowing that trump had launched  tomahawk cruise missiles into a syrian airfield in response to the chemical weapons attack  so it s not like this was any sort of breaking news segment when o reilly s extra  minutes was up  smith s time ended  and tucker carlson s show started right on cue  with no mention of what happened to o reilly  and no explanation hopefully  this is a sign that bill o reilly is on his way out at fox  and his toxic message will poison the airwaves no more featured image via video screen capture
