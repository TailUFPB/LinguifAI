for many people  jon stewart s  the daily show  was a welcome antidote to anything that happened during each day of the george w  bush presidency  now that we are  days into the era of president donald trump  it is needed more than ever  luckily  jon stewart  samantha bee  ed helms and rob corddry were brought together by stephen colbert to give the country the next best thing  a  daily show  reunion the group of funny people chatted about their experiences on the show  clips were played and they did one sketch  watching the group talking about the sketches they had done and then looking at the sketches themselves was a good way to remember why we loved that show just so much it is sometimes hard to imagine how the events that are currently happening in washington  dc could possibly be satirized but it would be great to watch these talented people give it a try part one part two stephen colbert s last day at  the daily show  featured image via cbs
