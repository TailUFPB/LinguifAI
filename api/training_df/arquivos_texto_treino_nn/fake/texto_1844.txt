anyone who knows anything about the separation of powers understands that a president cannot just unilaterally take military action  he needs approval from congress to execute an act of war  however  since donald trump is president and he seems to think he is somehow above the law  he doesn t bother with silly little details like that  as a result  we got his launching of  tomahawk missiles into a syrian airfield  it turns out that quite a few people in congress believe what trump did to be potentially illegal  one such person is rep  ted lieu  d ca  rep  lieu is one of trump s harshest critics and perhaps his most prolific twitter troll  when it came to trump s military action in syria  lieu did not mince words  speaking with msnbc s katy tur  lieu said  clearly  the president can take limited actions that the congress has authorized such as going against terrorists who were involved with   or in terms of iraq when congress authorized the use of force in   but there s been no congressional authorization to launch fifty nine cruise missiles at a country that has not attacked us  donald trump s action last night was unconstitutional  he should not do it again  rep  lieu then went on to explain his problems with the launch and the dangers of taking such drastic action with no authorization and no clear strategy  after being asked if he would have authorized this action if he had been given the opportunity to do so  i might have if he would have articulated a strategy  and that is one of my fundamental problems with what he did  there has been no coherent strategy from the trump administration  last week  they signaled they were okay with assad even though he had previously killed hundreds of thousands of people in syria and used chemical weapons  last night  they attacked the assad regime  we need to know what is the trump administration thinking and what is their long term strategy in syria  rep  lieu is right  trump s actions went against the constitution  he cannot unilaterally make war  further  he is clearly an erratic  impulsive man  said erratic  impulsive man now has the power to destroy the world with one temper tantrum  therefore  more than ever  it is absolutely imperative that congress use its article i powers to check and balance this dangerously unstable president watch rep  lieu s remarks below featured image via video screen capture
