right wing pastors are the ones really waging war on christmas a crazy  christian  pastor in texas decided to ruin christmas for all the little boys and girls at a mall in amarillo and filmed himself doing so as horrified parents looked on david grisham jr  walked into the mall and began filming himself delivering unsolicited preaching to children who were there to see santa claus the last frontier evangelism leader laid out his plan to tell kids that santa is a fake all while insisting that jesus is real  the man you re going to see today is just a man in a suit  dressed up like santa  but santa does not exist   grisham said   parents  y all need to stop lying to your children and telling them that santa claus is real when  in fact  he s not  grisham continued to repeat that santa isn t real and told parents they should be teaching them about jesus instead  when you substitute the lie of santa claus in the heart of your child for the truth of jesus christ  you are bearing false witness against god  don t lie to your children and tell them there s such a thing as santa  when you know in reality that there are no flying reindeer  there is no workshop at the north pole  there is no elves making toys  that you buy all the gifts and put them under the tree  some angry fathers confronted grisham to make his leave  quit talking this mess  you understand me   one man tells grisham   now stop  i ve got my kids over there  we don t need you coming over here and blabbing whatever the hell you re blabbing  now go on   go  now  that s not your decision to tell my kids what s the truth and what s not  here s the video via youtube this is the example of the so called  war on christmas  that fox news has been looking for  but they won t report on it because it s a conservative pastor waging it in fact  there is more evidence that santa claus is real than there is that jesus is real while scholars rely on the bible as their source for jesus  existence  the person we call santa claus today was born nikolaos of myra in  century greece and was declared a saint during the  century  saint nicholas is reputed to have performed miracles  and his reputation for secretly giving gifts to people in need gave rise to the story of santa claus  over time the life of saint nick was blended with nordic folktales that have turned into the story of santa we know so well today  sure  the story of santa claus has changed through the centuries to include a sleigh  flying reindeer  milk and cookies  going down chimneys  elves making toys  and living at the north pole  but santa is still based in reality and there is evidence that he existed featured image  screenshot
