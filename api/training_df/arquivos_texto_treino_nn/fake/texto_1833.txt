the winners of the  pulitzer prize have been announced and this year s theme was all about exposing trump of particular note was the prize for national reporting going to david a  fahrenthold of the washington post  whose contribution to reporting during the presidential campaign was to unflinchingly go after trump s lies  particularly as they related to his contributions to charity as the pulitzer committee put it  fahrenthold deserved the award for persistent reporting that created a model for transparent journalism in political campaign coverage while casting doubt on donald trump s assertions of generosity toward charities during a campaign when many reporters and pundits struggled to keep up with trump s lies  or pretended trump wasn t lying at all  fahrenthold decided to hold trump s feet to the fire  after trump repeatedly dodged questions about his donations to charity  fahrenthold compiled an exhaustive list of charities trump was said to have given money to and painstakingly eliminated each one  in the end  the reporting showed that trump was perhaps one of the least charitable rich people in the country  he also ran down individual anecdotes exposing trump has a showboating opportunist who cynically exploited charity events for pr but avoided giving any money in one example discovered by fahrenthold  trump stagecrashed an event meant to honor donors  stole the seat of a legitimate donor and then left before anyone knew what had just happened  nobody knew he was coming   said abigail disney  another donor sitting on the dais   there s this kind of ruckus at the door  and i don t know what was going on  and in comes donald trump   just gets up on the podium and sits down  trump was not a major donor  he was not a donor  period  he d never given a dollar to the nursery or the association to benefit children  according to gretchen buchenholz  the charity s executive director then and now it is for exposing stories like this and others that fahrenthold has become reviled in the trump white house and in conservative circles  he does what fearless journalism has always done  speak truth to power hilariously  farhrenthold isn t the only person to win the prestigious award for his coverage of trump  miami herald cartoonist jim morin earned a pulitzer for equally biting criticism of trump  to highlight the point  his latest cartoon is a particularly brutal take down of trump another loudmouth draft dodging sanctimonious hypocrite phony patriot republican sending us to war  morintoon  trumpsyria  chemicalattack pic twitter com   jim morin   morintoon  april    the new york times took home the international reporting pulitzer for coverage that also caused trump no shortage of headaches  the paper exposed the rampant corruption and cruelty of the putin regime in russia  this made things extremely awkward for trump  he  of course  benefited greatly from putin s willingness to undermine democracy   specifically america s  election  trump has also praised the autocrat as a strong leader and at one time claimed him as a friend it s extremely telling that so many of the top honors went to people who either directly or indirectly stood up to trump s administration   whether it be clear eyed reporting on the corruption from within the white house or the disastrous effects of the policies they and their allies in congress have forced upon the country  in dark days  fearless critical reporting is more valuable than ever  and with trump already threatening to crank up censorship laws  it s a rare and powerful commodity featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
