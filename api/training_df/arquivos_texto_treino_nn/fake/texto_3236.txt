this year was a rough one and many of us can t wait for it to be over  not only did america endure a very emotionally volatile  stressful election  but several amazing celebrities had passed away unexpectedly the year  had already seen the deaths of amazing celebrities such as george michael  david bowie  prince  alan thicke and muhammad ali  most recently  beloved actress carrie fisher and her mother  fellow actress debbie reynolds  have passed on  as america wept over this tragedy  actor charlie sheen took to twitter to express his feelings over these recent deaths  as well as send a strong message to donald trump  in a tweet that immediately drew criticism  sheen called on god to take trump s life next  complete with a middle finger emoji twitter as the country was still mourning the death of fisher and her mother  the tweet was liked and retweeted thousands of times  but despite the fact that the majority of america is repulsed by trump and did not vote for him by any means  sheen s tweet was also rejected by many  as multiple people came forward to denounce sheen s ill advised message  the opposing consensus was clear   joking about someone s death is not funny  no matter who it is  here are some of those responses twitter some even brought up sheen s own dirt  giving him a humbling reality check twittertwittertwitter while most of us could agree that trump is absolutely repulsive and undeserving as the next leader of our country  joking about a president elect s death is nothing but distasteful  one twitter user even pointed out that there shouldn t be a double standard even though trump is an absolute moron  imagine a hollywood celebrity tweeting their wish for obama s death  that would be cnn s lead story in seconds  to quote first lady michelle obama   when they go low  we go high   yes   was a trying  emotional roller coaster   and with trump taking the white house in january   will likely be just as hard if not worse  but we can t allow this disastrous president elect to devolve us into people like his supporters  after all  trump himself once called for hillary clinton s death during his presidential campaign  we must never stoop to his level  because rising above hatred and fear is the only way trump can be defeated featured image via christopher polk getty images
