as we all know  there are many children in america who cannot afford school lunch  some of these kids are  lucky   and i use the term loosely  to qualify for free or reduced price school lunches  others are not  to qualify for these government sanctioned programs  the children have to be from a family whose income is no more than   above the poverty line  that means that a family of four can make no more than    a year to qualify  any adult living in america today understands that this is a very difficult   in fact  damn near impossible   amount of money to live on  so  this leads to many children around the country going through the lunch line at school with the inability to pay  however  the tactics used to solve this issue are downright appalling  and they are being deployed all over the nation a practice referred to as  lunch shaming  is being used to humiliate poor children around the nation for their inability to pay for their lunches  some kids are stamped in the lunch line with stamps that say things like   i need lunch money   others are forced to clean tables in the cafeteria in front of other students  still others even have their hot lunches thrown out for their inability to pay all this serves to do is humiliate already struggling children for things that are far beyond their control  further  in the cases where the lunches are thrown out  the kids are forced to go hungry  even worse  some of these kids only get fed at school  so that means that they are literally starving when their one source of food is denied to them this kind of thing has lifelong effects  luckily  new mexico has become the first state to try to put a stop to the practice of lunch shaming  they have introduced legislation that would outlaw the practice  and would make it illegal to engage in any conversations regarding a student s ability to pay for lunch at school with anyone but the student s parents or guardians the entire nation needs to follow in new mexico s footsteps  the fact that this sort of thing is happening in the united states of america at all is disgraceful  we should all be ashamed watch the video report on this practice below  via aj  on twitter children are being shamed for not having lunch money across the u s  pic twitter com   aj    ajplus  april    image via video screen capture
