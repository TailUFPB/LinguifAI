 i m convinced that whenever trump says  most people don t know   it really means  i just learned    that was chris hayes s takeaway from watching trump s flailing attempt to talk about abraham lincoln   a man he clearly knew nothing about  the fact that he was ignorant of one of america s most famous presidents was painfully obvious an infamous bullshitter  trump is either getting worse at it or we re getting better at spotting it trump was at a fundraiser for republicans when he decided to share a little hidden gem about abraham lincoln that he assumed nobody knew  lincoln was a republican for most people who graduated elementary school that is common knowledge  for trump  it was a revelation  he was so impressed by it that he ordered republicans to start paying to promote the fact  great president  most people don t even know he was a republican  right  does anyone know  a lot of people don t know that  we have to build that up a little more  naturally  even that statement was a lie  a recent pew study found that over half of respondents knew that lincoln was a republican nevertheless  he instructed right wing political action committees to start buying television ads to inform the public that abraham lincoln was a republican  the crowd politely laughed  unsure if it was a joke or not the remainder of trump s speech was equally insane  at one point  he noted a few rival real estate developers in the crowd and had an on stage meltdown  he s president of the united states and still engaged in petty feuds with business tycoons that he views as his competitors  his unfiltered rant is like watching his brain go to war with itself  he knows he should be more dignified  less petty  but he just can t help it this is  by far  my favorite bit from the president s speech tonight  pic twitter com   hunter walker   hunterw  march    unhinged behavior featured image via twitter
