donald trump supporter kayleigh mcenany was taken to the woodshed on thursday by cnn s jake tapper cnn has been asking trump surrogates why they are portraying women accusing the republican nominee of sexual assault as liars but are so adamant that bill clinton s accusers are telling the truth jeffrey lord stammered and did a death spiral when anderson cooper questioned that hypocrisy earlier in the day  so cnn host jake tapper posed the same question to mcenany and she crashed and burned mcenany began by declaring that every woman who makes a sexual assault allegation should be heard  only to then attack trump s accusers   there are a lot of reasons  the facts that lead us to question these accusations   she said  she went on to question the new york times story by claiming that the same authors of that story published a story in may in which their source recanted and she questioned them because they allegedly never filed a police report against trump that s when tapper hammered mcenany by pointing out her hypocrisy and the fact that clinton accuser juanita broaddrick signed an affidavit denying that she was raped by the former president and reminded her that another of clinton s accusers did not report their allegations to police before making a public accusation in other words  the trump campaign has a double standard when it comes to sexual assault accusations  kayleigh  i have to say  because we had a conversation on sunday during the debate after mr  trump brought out the three women who have accused bill clinton  two of them of sexual assault and one of them of rape  and you didn t go into detail questioning their accounts  one of them signed an affidavit saying that there had not been any nonconsensual sex and then recanted it  you didn t have a problem with that inconsistency  one of them didn t report the alleged incidents to police  you didn t have an incident that  my question is why do you have a different standard for mr  trump s accusers than you do for mr  clinton s accusers  tapper later went on to correct mcenany that  sexual assault is not sex  after she said she isn t  here to litigate  donald trump s sexual past here s the video via youtube this is the question every trump supporter should be asked  because trump and his campaign are insisting that bill clinton s accusers are telling the truth while demonizing women who come forward with sexual assault accusations against trump  if they truly believe every woman should be heard  then they have to admit that trump s accusers could be telling the truth  too also  bill clinton is not running for president  donald trump  however  is featured image  screenshot
