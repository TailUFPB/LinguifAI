cnn host carol costello was so fed up with a trump s supporter s claims of voter fraud that she threatened to cut the interview short and then destroyed her with facts crazy trump supporter betsey mccaughey made every effort to squeeze in every little claim of voter fraud she could think of during her appearance on cnn on thursday  this nation has been victimized by rampant election fraud   mccaughey declared  citing a pew report to claim that dead people are voting  forcing costello to warn her about making claims that are  not true  mccaughey made her claims in defense of donald trump s assertion that the election is  rigged  in favor of hillary clinton when costello and democratic strategist sally kohn ripped into the republican nominee for refusing to say that he will concede on election day if he loses  mccaughey tried to spin it by claiming that trump didn t say he wouldn t accept the results  only that he would wait until the results come in before he makes a decision however  her spin is now void because trump told a crowd in ohio that he will only accept the results  if i win  when mccaughey continued to falsely claim that there is mass voter fraud in this country  costello slammed the brakes on the discussion and told mccaughey that if she continues to lie her mic will be cut costello   stop  or i m going to have to cut this interview short  mccaughey   you don t want people to hear the evidence  as mccaughey continued to make her claims  the discussion only became more heated as a frustrated costello put an end to the discussion and called for a break while producers pulled up some evidence for costello to hit mccaughey with here s the video via youtube but mccaughey had no evidence and costello proved it after the commercial break by playing video of ohio s republican secretary of state jon husted saying that trump s claims are  irresponsible  and that america s system of elections are fair and secure and  we should not question the legitimacy of it  costello then informed mccaughey that the pew reports she cited only says that there are dead voters still registered and that the system needs to be updated  it did not say that these dead people are voting sally kohn then pointed out that a comprehensive study found that out of one billion votes cast between  and   there were only  possible cases of voter fraud here s that video via youtube in short  voter fraud is a myth perpetuated by republicans in order to justify voter id laws designed to suppress voters and as an excuse to explain how democrats are able to win elections donald trump is using the myth as an excuse to why he would lose to hillary clinton and he is making a treasonous mockery of our democratic process by doing so featured image  screenshot
