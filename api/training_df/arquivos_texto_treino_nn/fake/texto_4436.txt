the men of morning joe found donald trump s insults against women funny  but mika brzezinski shut them and their disgusting sexism down hard joe scarborough and willy geist had a laugh over trump s interview with bill o reilly on wednesday night and seemed to have no problem with him fat shaming women just because they gain a little weight scarborough tried to excuse trump s behavior as  just trying to help  while geist called trump the real  hero of this story  a sickened mika then jumped in and took trump to the woodshed on behalf of women everywhere  it s a beauty contest  you can t actually have any weight on your body for a beauty contest because that wouldn t be beautiful  think about that  geist then cracked that women shouldn t  put on  pounds  and attributed the  joke  to newt gingrich  a supporter of trump and his campaign  really   mika asked   that s the pot  people like donald trump and newt gingrich and men can walk around just rotund as all get out   mika continued  and it s not an issue  but women  in order to be beautiful  you have to be  pounds  i m sorry  can someone tell me what year we re in here  is it   i think we re back in the  with these hideous pageants   which  by the way we need to talk about at some point  someone who runs beauty pageants   you have to think about how they think about women look at those beauty pageants  look at them  young women walking around in bikinis getting graded on how they look  i can t believe we still do these things do we want someone who ran beauty pageants  and still thinks it s okay to talk about gaining weight being a problem  do we really want that person in the white house  hiring women  i don t think he s going to hire women unless they re tens  in his view  which is  pounds and starving and covered in plastic  indeed  these sexists think it s okay for them to gain weight but they think women should be held to certain standards  and that s why trump is getting his ass handed to him by women right now in the polls joe scarborough repeatedly tried to interrupt mika and talk over her throughout her rant  which is something he probably took a lot of flack about later after the show in the end  however  mika got the last word and made it clear that trump s treatment of women is not something to joke about  it s disgusting  it s perverted  it s a serious story  stupid men  here s the video via youtube donald trump s sexism should automatically disqualify him from seeking the presidency  instead  republican chose him as their leader and that demonstrated just how little they care about women  and if every woman in this country voted against trump and the gop every year  the party would go extinct featured image  screenshot
