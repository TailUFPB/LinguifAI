the only time republicans want to actually help people is when it will help them  too  rep  david jolly  r fl  is well aware of this  and being from florida  he s understandably angry about the house s refusal to pass funding to combat zika  so he decided to try and make his obstructive  intransigent colleagues understand the crisis   by threatening to release  mosquitoes from florida onto the house floor he also berated them for their utter selfishness  i brought these mosquitoes today to convey that fear and that anxiety of millions of americans  of floridians  can you imagine the fear and anxiety in this chamber if these mosquitoes were outside this jar  not inside this jar members of congress would run down the hall to the physician s office to be tested  they would spray themselves before coming down here  this is the fear of floridians  right here  the house is interested in defunding planned parenthood to the point where they stick that legislation in everything  hoping that putting it in an otherwise must pass bill will lead to getting rid of the organization altogether  they do this even when doing so is totally irrelevant  and actually damaging  to the very real problems americans face like zika  in florida  watch him go at the rest of the house below democrats actually blocked the bill  but they did so because of provisions on planned parenthood  the fact that it would rob the aca of needed funding  and the fact that it was nearly   billion less than the obama administration had requested  furthermore  the senate passed a bi partisan zika bill of its own that the house wouldn t vote on  republicans love to play this game so they can blame democrats for obstruction the truth is  if they d just pass a clean bill like grown ups  then we d have a lot more governing and a lot less of this in fact  paul ryan said that when it came time for house and senate negotiators to act  it was democrats who refused  he left out one teensy  tiny little detail when he blasted them about it   the fact that republican negotiators insisted the bill must carry a provision blocking funding for a planned parenthood affiliate in puerto rico since january  zika has spread to  states  likely exists in far more  and is at crisis levels in florida   pregnant women have been diagnosed with the virus  and there are probably hundreds more who are currently undiagnosed  as of just a few days ago  there were  known cases total in florida  there were  known cases in california with this  one would hope that republicans could put their politics aside and pass a clean bill to address the crisis  and then go back to playing politics if they must  vice president biden actually went straight to congress to ask them to stop playing games  from reuters  give us an up or down vote  straight  on zika   biden said at an event on capitol hill with fellow democrats from the senate and house of representatives  i understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation   but this is a national emergency   biden added   people s health  the well being of unborn children  the health of the country at large  is at stake  act  republicans don t care  so jolly decided to try and force them to care by threatening them with zika to see how they d react  he decided to try and instill the fear that his state feels over the virus  it s unclear if the gambit worked  though  if it doesn t  then the situation is just more proof that the gop isn t actually pro life  because if they were  this would have been a done deal long ago   and also that they couldn t give two craps about helping anybody featured image via screen capture from embedded video
