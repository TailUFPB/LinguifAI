president elect donald trump has been a sore subject for speaker of the house rep  paul ryan  r wi   not only did ryan speak out against trump multiple times during his presidential campaign  but stopped short of pulling his endorsement   but ryan is getting exceedingly worse at defending the president elect as time goes on last night  ryan gave an extremely awkward  cringeworthy interview on cbs   minutes  every time scott pelley tried to grill ryan on trump  the speaker of the house pretty much crumbled under the pressure the most hilarious part of the interview was when pelley asked ryan about trump s recent claim that  millions of people  voted illegally  therefore costing him the popular vote  pelley asked  trump tweeted in the last week or so that he had actually won the popular vote if you deduct the millions that voted illegally  do you believe that  you can practically see ryan s skin crawling  ryan was noticeably uncomfortable with the question  and went into survival mode by playing dumb  real dumb  blinking uncomfortably  ryan said  i don t know  i m not really focused on these things  pelley cornered ryan and pressed him  wait a minute  wait a minute  you have an opinion on whether millions of americans voted illegally   and ryan got even dumber  right before our eyes  he said  i have no way of backing that up  i have no knowledge of such things  ryan eventually gave up and without ever really answering the question  he said  it doesn t matter to me  he won the election  you can watch the humiliating interview below it s no secret that ryan and trump have had a rocky relationship  unfortunately  these super awkward interviews are about to become more frequent  as trump and ryan try to get along and make some sort of peace before trump begins his term featured image via scott olson getty images
