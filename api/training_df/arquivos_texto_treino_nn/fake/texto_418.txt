somebody must have put some truth serum in little donnie s cheerios this morning  because first thing this morning  he tweeted something that was actually nice about a federal agency that his republican cohorts love to denigrate   fema hurricane irma is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help  be careful  be safe   fema  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    didn t stop there  during a joint press conference at the white house with the emir of the state of kuwait  amir al sabah on thursday  trump was asked if he thought fema was being  spread too thin  with all of the crazy weather events happening right now  not only did he acknowledge how well fema was handling both hurricane harvey and the impending storms that have yet to come aground  but he noted that the media was actually doing their job and reporting non fake news  well fema is doing an incredible job  as you all know  i mean  you ve been reporting it  you ve seen how incredible they are  and there s a great bravery to what they re doing  like i said  something is off when captain congratulations has any praise for someone other than himself but then trump said something that sounded distinctly like he was acknowledging the existence of climate change  we ve never had a thing like this where you get hit with harvey  which was about as bad as it gets  certainly from the standpoint of a water dump  and then you get hit with irma  and there s one right behind irma  i guess you probably know  but a smaller one  but nevertheless right behind  now  not to detract from any concessions donald trump might be making to science  but i think he might be forgetting hurricanes katrina and rita  no matter  we ll take trump agreeing with basic facts wherever we can get it watch the clip from the joint press conference here president trump   certainly we re being hit with a lot of hurricanes  we ve never had a thing like this   https   t co xrdzaialuv  nbc news   nbcnews  september    image via chris kleponis  pool  getty images
