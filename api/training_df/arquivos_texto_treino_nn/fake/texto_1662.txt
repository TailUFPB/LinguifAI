donald trump and the republican congress are busy trying to shred healthcare for the rest of us  but one republican lawmaker is using obamacare to get major surgery before he leaves office utah rep  jason chaffetz has been outspoken about the republican effort to kill the affordable care act  he s been salivating at doing so for years  he calls it a failed program that has done nothing but hurt the american people but while he s busy trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law  he has no problem using it himself earlier this month  chaffetz announced that he would not seek re election after his current term expires  however  he s going to make sure he sucks as much healthcare out of american taxpayers as he can before he officially leaves chaffetz posted a message to facebook on wednesday night informing his constituents that he will be getting major surgery on his foot and will be taking the next   weeks offchaffetz seriously expects us to understand and give a damn about his situation  the problem is that he lacks sympathy and empathy when it comes to ordinary americans who can t afford such surgeries and the amount of recovery time required and if republicans succeed at killing the affordable care act  americans will be at serious risk of not having health insurance to cover such medical procedures chaffetz  on the other hand  is using his gold level health insurance under the affordable care act to cover his surgery  so he is literally using the affordable care act to make sure his healthcare needs are met  and after he has no further use for it he ll vote to kill the law for everyone else americans were not happy about this hypocrisy  so they stormed chaffetz s twitter page and hammered him for it  jasoninthehouse and you re going to use this as a teachable moment as to why coverage for pre existing conditions and paid health leave is important  yes   patrick s  tomlinson   stealthygeek  april    jasoninthehouse so what you mean to say is   even though i ve screwed america s democracy for years  y all are paying for my surgery  thanks  suckers     dustin miller     spdustin  april    spdustin  jasoninthehouse to remove screws  which is a pre existing condition  how ironic when he takes away our ability to do the same   benedict trump   antitrumpactive  april    antitrumpactive  jasoninthehouse i guess  jasoninthehouse is the lucky one  he gets to be un screwed by healthcare  https   t co jerywrzifz    dustin miller     spdustin  april    antitrumpactive  nativepuma    spdustin  jasoninthehouse step aside  i ve found a nurse with real skill  experience  and a delightful bedside manner  pic twitter com sxgnaklwwh  kiba inu   aryanshepherd  april    allicloud  jasoninthehouse i bet they hold his job for him  he must just work harder than everyone else cause he gets this and a cell phone     zztaine     april    jasoninthehouse while you re recovering think about ordinary americans who will lose coverage for pre existing conditions like this  was this a choice   i ll ride with you    mrshellwinger  april    jasoninthehouse you selling your iphone to pay for this  or are my tax dollars paying for your stupidity  jeremy m   thismyshow  april    jasoninthehouse try doing that with no health insurance  at almost   i have never gone without it   gop wants to price me out of the market  for shame   katharine orgain   orgainkorgain  april    jasoninthehouse gee  most of us would have to commute to work on crutches soon after surgery so we could keep our jobs   amy sacks   amysacksnyc  april    to sum it all up  jasoninthehouse pic twitter com   petworthian   petworthnewvie  april    image  alex wong getty images
