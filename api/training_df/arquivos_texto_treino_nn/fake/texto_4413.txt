true to form  trump and his campaign are royally pissed at newsweek and kurt eichenwald for their report on one of trump s companies that violated the cuban embargo  trump let loose a bunch of unrelated attacks  but the campaign s official response wasn t much of a response  that is  until kellyanne conway opened her mouth on the view when the ladies of the view asked conway about the cuba story  she first said  read the entire story  it starts out with a screaming headline  as it usually does  that he did business in cuba  and then it turns out he decided not to invest there  but trump hotels   casinos did spend    there  which violated the embargo  conway either doesn t know what all the embargo banned  or she has no idea how to stick to her defense of her lord and savior  when the ladies of the view pressed her further  she said  i think they paid money  as i understand from the story  they paid money in   and then  of course  she launched into a totally irrelevant diatribe about hillary clinton but we digress whether it was  or just before obama lifted certain restrictions  trump s hotel company illegally spent money in cuba while he was chairman and still had a controlling interest  end of story and that s concerning  as is the  law and order candidate s  denial that he ever breaks the law  in fact  marco rubio  who has endorsed trump  is unhappy with eichenwald s findings  this is something they re going to have to give a response to  i mean  it was a violation of american law  if that s how it happened    said on the espn abc capital games podcast   i hope the trump campaign is going to come forward and answer some questions about this   this wouldn t be nearly the huge deal it is if he and his campaign would say something like   yes  this happened  however  it was handled and mr  trump and his businesses took the necessary steps to ensure this kind of thing never happened again   but kellyanne conway threw her boss under the bus in trying to deny this ever happened instead featured image by spencer platt getty images
