after the nation joined together and demanded a special prosecutor for the trump russia investigation  it happened former fbi director robert mueller was the second longest running in history  serving between  and    two years longer than the typical  year tenure for his position  my decision is not a finding that crimes have been committed or that prosecution is warranted   deputy atty  gen  rod rosenstein  on whom trump attempted to blame fbi director james comey s firing  said of his decision to appoint special counsel   i have made no such determination  rosenstein says that  based on the unique circumstances  the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises a degree of independence from the normal chain of command  during his time as fbi director  mueller taught his agents that  main stream   muslims are  radical  and that the more  devout  a muslim is the more likely he his to be  violent    a view shared by the majority of republicans ultimately  mueller reports to rosenstein  who reports to jeff sessions  who reports to donald trump  but this is the absolute best case scenario we can hope for in the swampful of corruption that is the trump administration it remains to be seen if mueller  whose conduct as director was called  appalling  and  disgraceful  will be working for the american people or if this is just part of the show featured image via screengrab
