how is the wicked witch of the white house still allowed to talk on television when house republicans passed their trumpcare bill on thursday  they did so without reading it or getting a cbo score for it  which made it easier for them to close their eyes and vote to screw over the american people  including their own constituents trump s healthcare bill would strip healthcare from millions of americans  prior to the affordable care act    people in this country died every year due to a lack of accessible and affordable healthcare  the trumpcare bill would repeal president obama s signature law and put thousands of americans at risk of dying because they can t get health insurance but kellyanne conway went on fox news on sunday to deny that people die because of not having health insurance  in short  her attempt to defend trump s bill was pathetic and insulting first  she referred to americans who oppose trump s bill as liars jeering from the  cheap seats  look  it s easier to jeer from the cheap seats than come up with a message of your own and be honest about the facts   conway said   how did we get here  why have so many americans asked for obamacare to be repealed and replaced  it s because you have premiums that have increased by  percent on average  and then she whined about opponents warning that the bill will kill people and accused them of using scare tactics  you know  saying people are going to die   and the enablers in the mainstream media not calling out those breathless  heartless predictions  and going right on to prognostication for   why in the world are we talking about who is going to win in  when the duty of the mainstream media  of  news reporters  is to tell you what s actually in the bill  not to allow others to scare  here s the video via youtube you know who is really being breathless and heartless  kellyanne conway once again  she is lying to the american people and insulting everyone who opposes donald trump and his downright evil agenda it is a fact that thousands of people died every year because they can t afford health insurance the affordable care act is not perfect  which is why democrats have offered to work with republicans to fix what needs to be fixed  but republicans are so obsessed with erasing every achievement made by president obama that they are unwilling to do so  they would rather scrap the entire law instead the problem is that the republican bill does not protect people with pre existing conditions  in fact  it classifies pregnancy  ptsd  and sexual assault as pre existing conditions that would disqualify people from getting health insurance  furthermore  it slaps senior citizens with an age tax and puts a limit on how long insurance will cover their needs  it also makes them pay more for healthcare than they currently do now under the affordable care act trump s bill would make it impossible for low income americans to afford health insurance  thereby sentencing them to death if they get seriously sick and can t afford care basically  trump s bill really does include death panels  which  interestingly enough  was a lie that republicans repeatedly used to scare people into opposing the affordable care act  now they are accusing democrats of doing the same thing even though trump s bill would repeal a law that has literally saved thousands of lives over the years  trump s bill would end those lives featured image  screenshot
