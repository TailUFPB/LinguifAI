one donald trump supporter just realized that she voted for the wrong candidate teena colebrook knew she had made a terrible error in judgment after donald trump picked former goldman sachs partner steven mnuchin to head the treasury department  i just wish that i had not voted   colebrook said   i have no faith in our government anymore at all  they all promise you the world at the end of a stick and take it away once they get in  colebrook believed trump when he said he would  drain the swamp   his term for getting rid of all the washington insiders and elites  she believed he would keep his promise to look after and take care of ordinary americans like herself  but trump s choice of a billionaire big wall street banker changed her mind about trump colebrook bought a triplex in  in los angeles for     she rented out two units to make extra income and lived in the third  she kept up the payments but then the recession hit and her two tenants lost their jobs according to the associated press over five years  she tried unsuccessfully to adjust her loan with onewest through the treasury department s home affordable modification program  but she said that one west bank lost paperwork  provided conflicting statements about ownership of the loan and fees and submitted charges that were unverified and caused her loan balance to balloon  by the time she lost her home in foreclosure in april   the payoff balance totaled    onewest bank was owned by steven mnuchin  and colebrook is not the only person he screwed over  two years ago  mnuchin s vulture bank literally tried to take a house away from a  year old woman over a  cent bill that s how petty and greedy mnuchin is  and that makes him unfit to be in a position that is supposed to serve the american people and protect them from economic predators like himself featured image  screenshot
