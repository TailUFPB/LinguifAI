when are racists going to learn that publicly posting their hate can get them canned because a white michigan firefighter has been dismissed after his racist post referring to a black woman using the n word and telling her she should go back to being a slave was brought to the attention of his boss ryan hudson whined on facebook about san francisco  quarterback colin kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality  a woman responded by writing  black lives matter   and that set hudson off  f ck black lives matter   hudson wrote   you are the epitome of a n gger  all lives matter  and if you think it s just black lives  kiss my ass b tch and go back to the fields that us in the north fought to free you from  basically i wrote  black lives matter   and that s when he spelled out in no uncertain terms  because he s now claiming he was drunk  first he was hacked  now he s drunk   the woman explained to fox  after hudson tried to excuse his behavior by first claiming that he was hacked before claiming that he was intoxicated as you can probably tell  the woman grabbed a screenshot of hudson s incredibly racist post  it soon became known to other firefighters  who reported it to the belding station fire chief greg moore moore said that hudson is the first person he has ever had to fire but he made the decision because firefighters sign on to help everyone no matter what color their skin is  hudson would have been a liability because he could easily transfer his hate into how he does the job the woman hudson attacked agrees with moore s decision  yes we do have free speech in this country  but free speech does not mean you re safe from the consequences of your free speech and your decisions  we don t just get to spout off at the mouth and spew hatred and ignorance  here s the video via fox  racists like hudson have been emboldened by donald trump to open their mouths  which has been quite helpful in identifying who should not be employed in this country  so it looks like trump actually created one job for someone in michigan  and as long as racists continue to spew their hate for everyone to see  more jobs will likely become available featured image via screenshot
