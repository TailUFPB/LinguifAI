we re wondering if sen  lindsey graham  r  is ok  he just doesn t seem to be himself lately  the south carolina republican was so fiercely critical of alleged president donald trump  but that s all suddenly changed now  graham  who once called trump a  jackass   praised the amateur president on saturday as a leader who is open minded  and is even willing to reach out for help  even late at night  according to the washington examiner  what have i learned about our president  he s curious  he asks questions  and he knows no fear   graham said in his remarks at the south carolina republican convention   and he s under siege unlike any president i ve ever seen in my entire life   they don t believe he won  i do  now obama was somewhat hard for us  but i thought we were somewhat respectful   graham added without one bit of irony whatsoever graham then went to on to disrespect former president barack obama by calling him a  community organizer who apologized for america every turn all over the world  let me tell you that you have a commander in chief that s not going to let this country get walked over anymore   he said and that s really cute  don t you think  he said that of obama who had  years of experience under his belt before taking the job as president while praising a former reality show star who had zero experience in politics  he calls and i m honored that he would call me and i want to help him   he said   he calls me when i m asleep and he calls me after i go to bed  i wish he would rest more  i gave him my phone number  so far so good  it s nice he has a cozy relationship with a man who just recently penned him a letter to assure him that he has no connections to russia  lindsey graham requested that information  trump s lawyers said in the letter that a review of the last  years of trump s tax returns revealed that he has no income from russia  with a few exceptions  here s the kicker  the law firm who sent the letter actually has deep ties to   wait for it   russia  lindsey graham appeared to be that one republican with a spine willing to call out the white house  but now he s rolling over while claiming that republicans respected obama  democrats are just being big ol  meanies to the man who is plagued in scandals while only  days into the job trump  for the record  is the same man who dogged obama for years  insisting that our first black president was actually a scary muslim from kenya  obama did not have conflicts of interest  the biggest scandal at this same amount of time during obama s presidency was that he put dijon mustard on his hamburger  that was the big scandal featured on fox news for a week  in contrast  trump has a massive amount of conflicts of interest sure  lindsey  we ll give trump the same respect republicans gave obama  no problem photo by alex wong getty images
