mental health professionals will now be allowed to openly diagnose donald trump for the first time since   a rule that prevents mental health professionals from publicly giving their expert opinion on the mental health of a public figure will no longer be enforced by the american psychoanalytical association the rule was put in place after barry goldwater sued fact magazine for publishing a poll in which a majority of psychiatrists declared him mentally unfit to be president  goldwater would go on to lose the presidential election of  but ever since trump declared his candidacy and began saying and doing insane things in public  many psychiatrists have openly defied the rule in order to inform americans on his mental state fox news pundit charles krauthammer  who is also a board certified psychiatrist  wrote a brutal diagnose of trump s mental health last august  trump s hypersensitivity and unedited  untempered pavlovian responses are  shall we say  unusual in both ferocity and predictability  this is beyond narcissism  i used to think trump was an  year old  an undeveloped schoolyard bully  i was off by about  years  his needs are more primitive  an infantile hunger for approval and praise  a craving that can never be satisfied  he lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value   indeed exists   only insofar as it sustains and inflates him  in addition  dr  drew pinsky also expressed concerns about trump s mental health  the question  though  is  are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected  that s a pretty hard thing to predict  i don t know if this is just somebody playing politics  or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses  when i hear people that are impulsive with their speech  i worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions  at the time  psychiatrists were warned to avoid diagnosing trump without personally examining him first  but that has all changed six months into trump s presidency  the american psychoanalytical association has given permission to their   members to do just that and you can bet trump s head is going to explode former apa president dr  prudence gourguechon explained the decision to stat news  we don t want to prohibit our members from using their knowledge responsibly since trump s behavior is so different from anything we ve seen before   dr  gouguechon said indeed  americans need this knowledge now more than ever before as trump continues to lash out at anyone who criticizes him and is even starting to throw members of his own administration under the bus  his emotions and behavior are so unpredictable that it is understandable that people would worry  especially considering that trump has access to nuclear weapons it s time for americans and congress to demand trump undergo a mental health exam by a board certified psychiatrist  furthermore  it s time to invoke the  amendment and declare trump unfit to serve  this insanity has gone on long enough  america cannot continue to be led by an unstable narcissist  it s time to make america sane again featured image via ralph freso getty images
