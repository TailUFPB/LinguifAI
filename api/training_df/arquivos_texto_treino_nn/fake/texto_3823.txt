this is truly a sad group of people we ve put in charge of the country  trump himself doesn t want to work and seems to be actively avoiding it  his transition team is in chaos  and now  some of his inner circle are reportedly talking about getting revenge on republicans who opposed him during the election this is despite the fact that many of those republicans are now saying that they look forward to working with him  to be sure  it s not uncommon for incoming administrations to subtly reward loyalty and just as subtly punish opposition  however  these people  probably because they re tied to trump  who would expect no less  are being far more blatant about it  the source suggested that trump s political operation would steer business away from republicans who were involved in the  nevertrump effort to block trump from the gop nomination  denying opponents and critics positions within the administration is one thing  this is something entirely different  this has shades of actually trying to ruin some of the republicans that had enough of a brain and a conscience to refuse to support trump and  as trumpkins are suddenly so fond of saying  the election is over  he won  so move the fuck on  except the republicans who opposed trump and  went over the line  in their opposition can now either work with trump or basically  put up and shut up  they aren t likely to get very far in continuing to stand against him the way they did during the election cycle this is as opposed to all the people who are legitimately frightened by the idea of a racist president who appeals to christian bigots and white supremacists and thinks sexually assaulting women is okay  we won t be getting over it anytime soon because we re afraid  and with good reason trying to ruin republicans by steering business and what not away from them isn t the only thing they re discussing  though  there s also this  he website seen as the unofficial news organ of trump world  breitbart news   which was co founded by trump s campaign chairman and possible white house chief of staff steve bannon   has signaled that it intends to continue its crusade against house speaker paul ryan  anybody who thinks that bannon doesn t have anything to do with breitbart s vendetta has another thing coming  bannon regularly referred to ryan as  the enemy  there  and personally made it breitbart s mission to destroy him  the publication has gone at that task with glee and will continue to do so ryan  for his part  was full of praise for trump on election night  he also believes their initial meeting went well  it may well have  and ryan is probably clueless about any talk of destroying him  or he doesn t believe trump is directly involved  or that such efforts will even succeed whether there s a chance for success or not  this is scary  and it actually sounds exactly like trump  all through the election  he felt getting revenge on people who slighted him was more important than actually running for president  so now  we ve got a man and his inner circle in the white house who seem to believe that revenge is more important than actually building an administration featured image by joe raedle via getty images
