saturday night live returned with a stellar cold open that featured alec baldwin s trump heading to kentucky for a town hall with a bunch of   as  trump  put it    people who don t just whisper  oh god what s happening after i leave the room  the sketch featured the donald listening to the concerns of his voters on healthcare  drug rehabilitation  and environmental hazards then explaining to them one by one that he s getting right of all of them but the last one  and  of course  one by one  they expressed dismay that their dear leader would take away things they love  like medical care  but still threw their support behind him because trump supporters are  as science tells us  not exactly the sharpest tool in a box containing a mixed metaphor  it s like you found a finger in your chili and you re still going to eat the chili because you told everyone how much you love chili   baldwin trump told his audience this is probably the best insult that has ever been leveled at trump s supporters by humankind  as trump once said  he could shoot someone in the middle of  avenue and not lose a single voter  no matter what he does  who he hurts  or which prostitutes urinate on his hotel room bed  his people will stand behind him because they are exactly as proud as they are stupid   and they will never admit they made a mistake watch the cold open below  featured image via screengrab
