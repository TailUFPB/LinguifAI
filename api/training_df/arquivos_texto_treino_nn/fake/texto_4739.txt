a retired general has had enough of donald trump denigrating the men and women of the u s  military currently engaged in the fight against isis and other terrorist elements  in an appearance on cnn  retired army lt  gen  mark hertling blasted trump for his recent claim that simply asking generals to come up with a plan to defeat isis would lead to the terrorist group s end in a neat and tidy thirty day period the former commanding general decried trump  calling his orders  simplistic  and insulting to individuals working to defeat isis  it shows a complete lack of understanding of the threat and the ways to fight it   hertling said   it s a sophomoric approach to elements of national security policy because if he s just calling in the military  he s missing the point that there are several other elements of national security that will help defeat isis  trump has been all over the map on isis  as he has been on hundreds of other issues  the former reality tv star has claimed that isis is on the march  it is in retreat  and that he has a plan to defeat isis  which he is keeping secret   trump has also claimed that he knows more than all the generals on how to win the war on terrorism in reality  trump s reckless comments have proven to be the right kind of material for isis leaders attempting to recruit new members  compared to the measured tones offered by president obama and secretary hillary clinton  trump s rhetoric attacking islam often sounds like the clash of civilizations the radical muslim world wants so badly daily  american military assets are fighting against isis elements  most notably american fighter jets that have been bombing isis targets in multiple countries for years now  in addition to work via intelligence agencies with governments fighting the isis threat  to minimize their work as trump does is a clear insult featured image via screen capture
