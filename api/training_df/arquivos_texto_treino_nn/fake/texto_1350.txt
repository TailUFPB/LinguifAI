donald trump doesn t like nato  much like the fact he doesn t understand nato  this is clear  on the campaign trail  his common statement was that the alliance was  obsolete   he has dozens of quotes trashing the alliance  now  he endlessly rails against our allies  not meeting financial obligations    which do not exist  we ll explore why those obligations do not exist in a moment  but for now  a simple metaphor to explain why nobody owes nato or the united states a dime imagine you re in a homeowners association  which collects small fees to run a neighborhood watch  and also  one of the bylaws deals with appearances   a guideline states all members should spend two percent of household income on the yard  paint  etc  imagine a neighbor fails to meet the two percent benchmark  did they fulfill the guideline s obligation  no  do they owe you  their neighbor  money  no  that s silly  you aren t paying for their yard  and the fees have already been collected for the  collective  spending on the neighborhood watch  you can be pissed their yard doesn t look as good as yours  but they re not costing you a dime  and they owe you nothing  that s why world leaders openly laughed at trump s idiotic nonsense at his nato speech  he has no understanding of how this works  nato  as an organization  has its own funding the north atlantic alliance has its own military budget worth    billion     billion   which is used to fund some operations and the nato strategic command center  as well as training and research  but it is miniscule compared to overall spending on defense by nato countries  which nato estimates will total more than   billion in  the alliance also has a civilian budget of    million    million   used mainly to fund the nato headquarters in belgium  and its administration   source who pays how much is determined by the size of the economy of each country the u s  share is calculated on the basis of gross national income   the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country   and adjusted regularly  currently that would be about  percent  compared to about  percent for germany   percent for france   percent for the united kingdom   percent for italy   percent for canada  and so forth when conservatives say the united states pays  percent of the budget for nato  and then list our own defense spending  that s extremely misleading  let s examine the following paragraph from fox business the united states contributed more than  percent of the organization s budget in   according to white house data  far outpacing all other members  the government spent   percent of gdp  or   billion  on defense  the united states  financial commitments to defense have fallen over recent years  down from more than    billion in   however  president trump s new budget looks to reverse that trend with a   billion injection into the defense sector despite the first two sentences being placed side by side  they are unrelated  we did pay  percent of nato s budget  we also paid   billion for our own defense  those two numbers are unrelated because we pay nato less than   million per year  pdf   it s almost as if trump never bothers to read anything  and that the outlets which support him are willing to publish any lie  or truth twisted beyond recognition  to the point of lying  such as in this case  to try and make his ignorant incompetence more palatable and considering we are the largest member nation by orders of magnitude  and that the american empire has   soldiers stationed in  nations around the globe  it makes sense that we would be spending the most money on our own military  other member nations do not have a global military force  we have a standing army three times larger than every other member except turkey  nato is not responsible for each nation s national defense  there is no collective spending pool for each nation s military  nato is a military alliance that says  i ve got your back if you get attacked   the alliance has guidelines   not rules   and advice on how to best allocate funding for national defense in order to prevent war in the first place  deterrence through preparedness so when fox news or donald trump tell you our allies aren t paying their fair share for  collective defense   or that the united states is spending far more to support nato than they are  that s simply bullshit  that s not nato s budget   the numbers they are talking about are a guideline for national defense  not nato  and they re just that   a guideline  there is no penalty for spending less than two percent of gdp on the military  in fact  our bloated and wasteful military budget is not something to brag about  a certain quote by president dwight eisenhower comes to mind every gun that is made  every warship launched  every rocket fired signifies  in the final sense  a theft from those who hunger and are not fed  those who are cold and are not clothed  this world in arms is not spending money alone  it is spending the sweat of its laborers  the genius of its scientists  the hopes of its children  the cost of one modern heavy bomber is this  a modern brick school in more than  cities  it is two electric power plants  each serving a town of   population  it is two fine  fully equipped hospitals  it is some fifty miles of concrete pavement  we pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat  we pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than   people        this is not a way of life at all  in any true sense  under the cloud of threatening war  it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron there is one point that i will begrudgingly give trump   our allies are over reliant on the fact they have a military juggernaut in their alliance  they are meeting their financial obligations to nato  despite what trump says  however  there s a reason that nato has a two percent guideline for spending on national defense   as stated above  preparedness through deterrence  right now  for many members  deterrence comes from big brother on the west side of the atlantic  yet trump s misleading rhetoric on this subject is masking the reality   they re already moving to expand their military budgets and have been for three years  thanks to the growing threat of trump s buddy putin  who has demonstrated in ukraine and georgia that he is willing to violate the sovereignty of and use force against his neighbors here s more  via cnn at a summit in   all members who were falling short promised to move toward the official target within a decade that pledge appears to be holding  the alliance as a whole increased defense spending for the first time in two decades in  so why don t more countries spend   of gdp  many experts point out that the target is problematic nato has warned against a rush to spend for the sake of spending  emphasizing that budget decisions must be based on strategic planning  for example  it wants countries to spend   of their defense budgets on equipment some member countries simply don t have armies big enough to be able to absorb a huge increase in funding quickly   that s why the  summit pledge gave laggards until  to do more so  trump s badgering is pointless  latvia  for example  increased spending by over  percent last year alone  almost every other member nation is steadily increasing military spending to be on track with the two percent of gdp guideline and the pledge made in   which already solved this problem  in fact  his stance on this issue is somewhat more sinister than just military buildup  he is accomplishing nothing but seeding ill will among our closest allies  between his blatant disrespect and refusal to directly endorse article   it seems more like he is trying to sabotage nato than improve it  and notably  we are the only nation to ever invoke article  and call our allies to our defense  soldiers from other nations fought and died for ours  and now when asked to state we will come to their defense  trump won t say so  instead  he demands money he isn t owed and who benefits from all of this the most russia featured image via stefan
