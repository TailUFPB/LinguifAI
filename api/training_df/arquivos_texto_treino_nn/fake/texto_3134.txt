tomi lahren literally thinks the beating of a white teen in chicago is the equivalent of nine black churchgoers who were murdered in charleston  south carolina in yet another example of racism and how right wingers sabotage themselves  conservative darling tomi lahren lost her shit over a hate crime that was committed in chicago this week by four black assailants the four suspects kidnapped and tortured a white disabled man and streamed the crime on facebook live but while her anger is understandable and shared by a vast majority of americans  including black lives matter and president obama  lahren went several steps too far by comparing the beating to the killing of nine black parishioners who were shot to death by white supremacist dylann roof  chicago police aren t sure if it was politically motivated   lahren claimed   are you freaking kidding me  this is the definition of a hate crime  and these four sick individuals deserve a seat on death row right next to dylann roof  and lahren totally lost all credibility right there with that single statement  in her mind  a white teen who lived through a beating is worth nine black people who were murdered  basically  she is saying one white life is worth nine black lives  and the white teen survived  plus  she thinks the four black suspects should be sentenced to death  again  while their actions are horrible  we don t sentence people to death for committing assault  nor do we sentence people to death for kidnapping  if they had murdered the victim  lahren would have a case for putting the death penalty on the table  but they didn t then lahren went on to question parenting in inner cities  which is her code for black people  times like these  we have to wonder  where are the parents  not just  wednesday   but when these four were growing up  because the breakdown of the american family has left young people   especially in the inner cities   with no role models  that s why they turn to celebrities and rap stars who chant  eff trump  for guidance and leadership  seriously  only racists like lahren push these stereotypes about black people  and then she whined and claimed that if the disabled man had been black and the suspects were white it would have been a bigger story  if the race roles were reversed here  can you imagine the coverage  the race of the assailants would be plastered on every headline from here to timbuktu  but if it doesn t fit the race baiting agenda of the left and their cohorts in the mainstream  it doesn t quite get the same attention  if this thing wasn t paraded on facebook live  the mainstream would have likely diluted  dismissed or outright ignored it   she said   if it bleeds  it leads   but only if it s the right color  huh  except the media widely covered this story across the nation and both president obama and black lives matter even condemned the actions of these four individuals here s the video via facebook predictably  the racists were quick to chime in with their own comments the bottom line here is that these four suspects should be punished for their crimes  which are inexcusable and indefensible  but lahren should not have compared this incident to the mass shooting in charleston  a brutal beating is nowhere near as bad a crime as nine counts of murder  she should apologize for that and to the families of the victims she just insulted featured image via screenshot
