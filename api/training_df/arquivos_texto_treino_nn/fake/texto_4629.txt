donald trump must think women are stupid  recently  the billionaire s campaign revealed what they pretend is a comprehensive plan to help struggling families after the birth of a child sure  trump has a long and storied history of making sexist remarks about women and generally treating them like trash  but now that he wants to be president  he s going to provide maternity leave  of course  his plan is not quite all he and his cohorts pretend it to be first off  men are left out entirely  sure  it s  when sometimes women work and men take care of the children  or there might be a couple of guys bringing a child into the world through one method or another  trump s plan  which proposes six weeks of maternity leave and tax credits for stay at home mothers  serves only to reinforce the stereotype that a woman s place is in the home cooking dinner and raising the kids and the man s place is to go out and serve as breadwinner  stay at home fathers  in trump s world  do not exist and should not even be considered for any tax credits and benefits part of the problem is that trump was famously uninvolved in raising his own children  i won t do anything to take care of them   he told howard stern in    i ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids  it s not like i m gonna be walking the kids down central park  men simply do not raise children  or so trump thinks  and  of course  it s probably best to let him think that in case he spawns more  can you imagine how much more f cked up his kids would be if he took a direct role in raising them of course  his thoughts on pregnant women in the workplace aren t very nice  either  in a  interview with dateline nbc   the billionaire explained that while pregnancy is  a wonderful thing for the woman  and her  husband   the idea of male same sex couples does not enter into his mind  of course  it s  an inconvenience for the business  and whether people want to say that or not  the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business   he concluded  adding that women  should  feel like they will be replaced if they do not return to work quickly even if they will not necessarily be replaced watch trump trash female employees who have the audacity to get pregnant below  featured image via screen capture
