trump lost his marbles on friday  letting loose on his senior staff over jeff sessions recusing himself from any and all department of justice investigations into russia  it s kind of strange   the investigations should go forward properly regardless of who s in charge  or would they  trump may not have thought so until sessions recused himself and put acting deputy attorney general dana boente  an obama appointee  in charge of those investigations boente gives the senate judiciary committee powerful leverage to demand a special prosecutor now  because trump s nominee for deputy attorney general  rod rosenstein  will have his confirmation hearings this month  the judiciary committee could press him to commit to appointing a special prosecutor to investigate trump and russia before voting to send his confirmation to the full senate if they manage to do that  russia will probably blow up  if they don t manage to do that  it s possible that the judiciary committee won t vote to send rosenstein to the full senate  which leaves boente in charge  the kicker is that boente  as an obama appointee  is less likely to fall under trump s influence there s historical precedence for the judiciary committee to demand such a commitment from a nominee of a corrupt president  too  in   during the unfolding watergate scandal  nixon nominated his former secretary of defense  elliot richardson  for attorney general  the judiciary committee not only demanded richardson commit to a special prosecutor for watergate  they demanded he name the person he d appoint before they would vote on his confirmation richardson did  and both he and his pick  archibald cox  were grilled on just how independent cox would be in pursuing watergate richardson was confirmed  cox was appointed  and then nixon began pressuring richardson to fire cox because cox was getting too close to the truth what happened with nixon  richardson  cox  and the entire watergate scandal  are why we need a special prosecutor with broad independent authority now  trump has accused obama of illegally wiretapping him  yet apparently  the fbi was able to get a fisa warrant for such tapping back in october  that means there are recordings that are not illegal  those recordings probably contain damning evidence and need to be investigated  if not outright released trump s ire suggests that he s terrified of what those recordings  along with other mounting evidence  will reveal  the more damning those recordings  the more he ll play the victim and act like everything would be just fine if obama s fbi had just left him and his campaign alone maybe trump thought sessions would prevent all of this  after all  sessions lied to the senate about his own contact with russia while working on trump s campaign as a top foreign policy adviser  or maybe he just thought sessions would resist calls to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the growing russia scandal and do it himself  under direction from trump himself trump projects endlessly  every accusation he levels is something of which he  himself  is either guilty or afraid  in this case  it s likely fear  besides sessions  disgraced national security adviser  general michael flynn  lied about contact with russia  trump s son in law  jared kushner  was present for some of that  two of trump s other campaign advisers  carter page and j d  gordon  likewise had contact with russia  paul manafort  who had a brief stint as trump s campaign manager  has business dealings with pro russia leaders in ukraine and yet  the trump administration has vehemently denied any contacts with russia at all during the campaign  while also saying that contact was brief  fleeting  informal  and innocuous  if so  then why lie like this  trump s frightened as hell right now  a doj under an obama appointee could easily be his undoing  and he knows it featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
