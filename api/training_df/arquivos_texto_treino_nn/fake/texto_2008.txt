donald trump and his republican allies are total losers  and even the conservative leaning wall street journal admits it the gop proved that they are totally incapable of governing on friday as the vote for trumpcare failed to materialize after republicans leaders in the house canceled the vote because they could not get the necessary support for it from their own party it marked the second time in two days that republicans failed to even bring their healthcare bill to the house floor for a vote of course  that s a good thing for the american people because the gop plan would have gutted the affordable care act  stripped health insurance from over  million people and caused premiums to skyrocket to prices unreachable for most americans but the failure to pass their own bill despite controlling congress and the white house demonstrates once and for all that even with absolute power  republicans are incapable of governing for seven years  republicans vowed to repeal the affordable care act  they rehearsed the vote to repeal it over  times in order to pander to their rabid base  but when it came down to it  republicans choked under pressure from millions of americans who angrily protested their effort to kill healthcare in an editorial on friday  the wall street journal humiliated trump and the gop for failing to govern  house republicans pulled their health care bill shortly before a vote on friday  and for once the media dirge is right about a gop defeat  this is a major blow to the trump presidency  the gop majority in congress  and especially to the cause of reforming and limiting government  republicans have campaigned for more than seven years on repealing and replacing obamacare  and they finally have a president ready to sign it  in the clutch they choked  indeed  and it goes much deeper than that  for years  republicans obstructed any and all legislation  including their own bills  all while insisting that they were capable of governing if only they could get a republican in the white house in november  they got their wish  but still could not pass their own bill  and the wall street journal predicts that they won t repeal the affordable care act at all  the risk of political suicide is not only too high to ignore  it s clear that there are conservatives who think government works best by failing to do anything  there will be no such repeal in this congress  and probably not in any other  republicans run the government and that means they are responsible for what happens in health care  much of the current conservative establishment profits from fanning resentments  not governing  legislative compromises don t help heritage action raise money for its perpetual outrage machine  an earlier generation of leaders at heritage understood that the goal of winning elections was to achieve something  the current leaders seem happy with failure  in the end  the wall street journal noted that this legislative failure is an  ominous  sign that trump s presidency is a failure  perhaps mr  trump and the gop can recover from this debacle  but as an opening act to a new presidency the collapse of his first legislative campaign is ominous  and that s particularly embarrassing because trump has not even completed  days yet featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
