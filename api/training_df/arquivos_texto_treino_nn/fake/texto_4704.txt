fox news is collapsing like a house of cards as the fallout over rampant sexual harassment continues gretchen carlson got the ball rolling when she filed a lawsuit against the conservative network  accusing fox boss roger ailes of sexually harassing her and punishing her for refusing to have sex with him rather than stand by their colleague  however  fox hosts such as greta van susteren and others took ailes  side instead but now that carlson has been vindicated and ailes forced to resign  van susteren now regrets not believing the victim in the first place in a post on facebook on friday  van susteren opened up about carlson and expressed regret for not believing carlson from the start  i read geraldo s fb post in which he said he regretted not believing gretchen carlson s claim of sexual harassment   she wrote   we all regret it   i made my regret self evident in my gretawire posting about  weeks ago which ended with this   gretchen  you go girl   that said it all  van susteren continued by admitting that it was unfair for her to judge the case since she was  miles away from where the harassment took place and that she had never talked to carlson about it to hear her side of the story personally  it is indeed true  when i read the complaint written by lawyers   i never spoke to gretchen as she was long gone from fox   i found it inconsistent with what was my experience and information at the fox news channel  admittedly working  miles from the  scene of the crimes   it was hidden from all of us  van susteren left fox news earlier this week and they replaced her with brit hume  a man who has spewed sexist remarks on the air for years and now that she is no longer employed by fox news  van susteren has absolutely no problem shaming her former employers for not doing anything about roger ailes sooner  but i have regrets beyond geraldo s and beyond not believing a civil complaint written by lawyers  i regret that roger ailes was not supervised by those in a public corporation who had the duty to supervise him  this included his seniors  the cfo s of both fox news channel and   and its predecessor newscorp   the board of directors and what i assume this public corporation had  outside auditors  checks written that were suspicious should have been spotted  but fox news still hasn t learned much since many of the people who let ailes get away with sexually harassing female employees  like bill shine  are still employed in their positions by the company even some high profile male hosts are still employed  including steve doocy  who was named in carlson s lawsuit  and bill o reilly  who was named in andrea tantaros  lawsuit fox news needs to go beyond axing ailes  they need to clean house or the working environment at fox will simply continue being  like a sex fueled  playboy mansion like cult  steeped in intimidation  indecency and misogyny  featured image via facebook
