donald trump s campaign just suffered its worst implosion yet  and conservatives have flown into a panic  on friday  audio surfaced of trump bragging to access hollywood reporter billy bush that he is so famous that he is able to  grab  any woman he finds beautiful  by the p ssy  ever since  republicans have been running away from their own nominee  including paul ryan  mike lee  and utah s gop governor  and even one of trump s most ardent supporters is now declaring that his campaign is doomed crystal wright wrote a column earlier this week in which she called black people  slaves  for voting for hillary clinton  she accused black people of voting for their color instead of voting their conscience   what do blacks have to lose voting for trump   she asked   absolutely nothing  but now wright is singing a different tune after the bombshell that dropped yesterday  i think it does matter what donald trump said and i think this is the death knell in his campaign   she told cnn host mike smerconish after he pointed out that trump supporters don t care what he says  a lot of trump supporters are saying  is it doesn t matter what he does  it doesn t matter what he says  the thought of hillary being president is so abhorrent  i am hitching myself to his wagon regardless   is that it  the problem with donald trump   wright explained   the reason why this comment is a punctuation mark on the narrative that he hates women is because isolated incident after isolated incident  we find donald trump saying awful things about women  indeed  trump has a history of talking about women as if they are sex objects meant to be conquered and controlled by men  which is why over  percent of women have an unfavorable view of him in this election wright still refuses to vote for hillary clinton despite trump s lewd comments but she did acknowledge that his campaign just lost the presidential contest  he cannot pivot away from this nonsense and talk about policies  unfortunately this is coming in the ninth inning  i m not happy about it  i will not vote for her  but in many ways it looks to me like the race is over  here s the video via cnn you know trump is in trouble when even his most ardent supporters can no longer defend him featured image via screenshot
