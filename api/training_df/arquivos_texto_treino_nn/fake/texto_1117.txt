while america is still recovering from the shocking shooting that occurred at a republican baseball game in which rep  steve scalise and four others were injured  many conservatives are still using the shooting as a way to promote division within america many republicans were quick to place blame on the democratic party  and today donald trump s white house adviser kellyanne conway jumped at the opportunity to strengthen those accusations  in an appearance on fox   friends  conway trashed the media and democrats for criticizing trump at the time of the shooting  arguing that it was democrats who were creating division in the country by refusing to praise trump for his poor performance as potus  conway said  i went back and looked at exactly what was being discussed on all the tv shows  except yours  at   a m  on wednesday  when this happened  and it s a really curious exercise  because as steve scalise was fighting for his life and crawling into right field in a trail of blood  you should go back and see what people were saying about the president and republicans at that very moment  of course  they had to break in with the news of this tragedy  and since then there s been some introspection   some quieter  more muted voices toning down the rhetoric  then  conway s rant got even more strange  still trying to pretend that her boss isn t the source of a good portion of the hate and division we are seeing in america today  she tried to give the bizarre example of her own death to make her point  she said  but look at twitter  if i was shot and killed tomorrow  half of twitter would explode in applause and excitement   this is the world we live in now  well  according to trump himself  he could technically shoot conway on a busy street in new york and get away with it   as he once bragged about  so for conway to be blaming democrats for the tension that our current republican potus has created is beyond unfair and misguided while many republicans were blaming the opposite party  democrats were praying and sending supportive messages in solidarity with their gop colleagues   disproving conway s accusations entirely  you can watch conway s ridiculous rant below featured image via mark wilson getty images
