while most of the free world  including the majority of americans  are horrified by donald trump s order banning muslims  there is one group of individuals very excited for it   islamic jihad trump s order only proves to cement their theory to those they are trying to recruit that the united states hates islam  it is a theory that holds no basis in reality  but trump is playing right into their hands according to the washington post  comments posted to pro islamic state social media accounts predicted that president trump s executive order would persuade american muslims to side with the extremists  one posting hailed the u s  president as  the best caller to islam   while others predicted that trump would soon launch a new war in the middle east further   al baghdadi has the right to come out and inform trump that banning muslims from entering america is a  blessed ban   said one posting to a pro islamic state channel on telegram  a social media platform  the writer compared the executive order to the u s  invasion of iraq in   which islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a  blessed invasion  that ignited anti western fervor across the islamic world  with former cia official robert richer  who served as  deputy chief of the agency s operations directorate during the george w  bush administration   saying  this was a win for jihadists and other anti u s  forces  it fuels the belief out there that americans are anti islam  otherwise  it accomplishes nothing  because the ones we are most concerned about can still get to the united states  trump s order is purely dangerous political posturing to not only the united states but the world  it does nothing to combat the threat of islamic extremism and only serves to help isis and other extremist jihad groups to recruit  trump made the order without going through the proper channels of advice  and apparently it wasn t even discussed with his secretary of homeland security trump is proving to be the danger we all knew he would be before getting elected  by electoral college only  and hopefully  congress will take the proper actions to stop him at every turn featured photo by andrew harrer   pool getty images
