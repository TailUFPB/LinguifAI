trumpers are rejoicing over the escalating activities of immigration and customs enforcement because of their wholly misguided belief that undocumented immigrants do nothing but sit here  in the u s   illegally soaking up every dollar that should go to actual americans  that mentality has spawned five squillion allegations about the behavior of immigration and customs enforcement  which has gotten increasingly brazen  and even abusive  since trump s election one ice agent has apparently had enough  and he s speaking out  jonathan blitzer  a contributing writer to the new yorker  got in touch with this agent  who would only allow these details to be published under condition of anonymity  who finds himself increasingly alarmed by the culture shift at the agency he s particularly angry about ice s specific targeting of children who entered the country as unaccompanied minors years ago  those children were placed with families and allowed to attend school here  hopefully so they could make themselves into contributing members of society  he told blitzer something shocking  that they re going after these children literally because they can  even though there s no real policy for what to do with them after they re rounded up  the plan is to take them back into custody  and then figure it out  i don t understand it  we re doing it because we can  and it bothers the hell out of me the whole idea is targeting kids  i know that technically they meet the legal definition of being adults  fine  but if they were my kids travelling in a foreign country  i wouldn t be o k  with this  we re not doing what we tell people we do  if you look  next month  or at the end of this month  at the people in custody  it s people who ve been here for years  they re supposed to be in high school  this isn t some rookie who s only been with the agency for a few months or a year  and probably hasn t fully assimilated into the culture and become a cold hearted  contemptuous  power drunk officer  this is veteran officer who has been in federal immigration enforcement since the clinton administration he talks about what things were like before trump  ice used to look at the full circumstances of a deportation case before making decisions  he feels that the job of the agency is not to judge the people they re detaining  and yet  many ice agents are doing just that now  and that s part of the problem  their contempt is growing by leaps and bounds and it s affecting how the agency runs as a whole  which trump fans no doubt love  while this particular agent was heavily critical of obama and what he saw as micromanaging from obama s administration  there s so much now that s gone that it s really no wonder individual agents seem hungry to arrest and remove as many people as possible   even if those people are children  it sounds like they re becoming single minded about it and this agent is also upset about the use of resources  our immigration system is already badly clogged  and has been for a long time  ice is pretty much intentionally making that worse  we still have to make decisions based on a responsible use of the government s resources you can t lock everybody up  we re putting more people into that overburdened system just because we can  there s just this school of thought that  well  we can do what we want  this is trump s america  this is what the trumpers want   they want  the other  gone and they don t care how it happens or who that  other  is  let alone what it s going to cost us  the fact that ice is targeting children who were specifically placed with families here  and who should be attending high school now  is just flat out vile  this is not america featured image via john moore getty images
