donald trump s administration is probably the most stressed out team the white house has ever seen  while dealing with multiple ethical issues and investigations  the administration never gets a day of rest as they are in constant reaction mode and doing damage control on his constant blunders  today was the perfect example of an administration that is hanging on by a thread earlier today  trump displayed his blatant stupidity as he gave a speech at the conservative values voter summit  during that speech  trump shocked over   attendees  and the world  when he said he d met with the  president of the virgin islands   this was trump s direct quote  i went to puerto rico  and i met with the president of the virgin islands  these are people that are incredible people  they ve suffered gravely  and we ll be there  we re gonna be there  we have  really  it s not even a question of a choice   we re going to be there as americans  trump apparently doesn t know that he is the president of the virgin islands  because the islands are a part of american territory  as expected  twitter dragged trump for this  there s really no way to gracefully fix this  but still the trump administration had to try  in a half ass  hilarious attempt to minimize trump s very obvious f ck up  the white house released a transcript of trump s remarks   and crossed out the word  president  and replaced it with the correction of  governor of the virgin islands   cnn s kaitlan collins made sure to share this with everyone it s like the trump administration didn t even try to be subtle  and how could they  just as they put out one fire  trump is making five more  trump s team doesn t have time or the energy to keep cleaning up his messes   and this pathetic attempt is direct proof featured image via isaac brekken getty images
