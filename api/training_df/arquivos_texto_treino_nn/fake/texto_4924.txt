donald trump has been raising a lot of eyebrows lately with his new and pathetic attempts to win over african american voters  despite the fact that he only has about  percent of the black vote as of right now  as usual  trump s delivery has been nothing but problematic  because he s been giving his speeches to mostly white crowds in mostly white areas because he doesn t feel safe in urban neighborhoods  this sparked a conversation on cnn that erupted into a heated exchange of words between guests charles blow and bruce levell don lemon started the discussion by rolling a ridiculous clip of trump claiming that he would be able to win  percent of the black vote after he serves four years in the white house  levell  who was representing the national diversity coalition for trump  got into an argument with blow so intense that lemon could hardly contain it and the two men forced cnn to skip a commercial break many of the two guests  jabs at each other were delivered in low voices but things got extra heated when blow  a new york times columnist  accurately called trump out for being a bigot and then accused levell for supporting bigotry  levell responded by trying to place blame on democratic nominee hillary clinton and her campaign by saying that they had purposely portrayed trump to look like a bigot  this was all too much for blow to handle  he erupted and laid into levell  i m not part of the clinton campaign  i m a black man in america and i know a bigot when i see a bigot and you are supporting a bigot and that makes you part of the bigotry that s donald trump  levell fired back   i know someone who doesn t tell the truth on national tv when i see it  sir  lemon eventually had to jump in and mediate  and was probably thankful that his guests hadn t been in the same studio for this discussion  you can watch the chaos unfold below featured image is a screenshot
