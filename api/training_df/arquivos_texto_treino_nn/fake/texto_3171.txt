after having to endure donald trump s disastrous presidential campaign and having to basically hold his hand every single day after the election  you can only imagine just how fed up president barack obama and his family are with trump and his entitled children  they re likely counting down the days until they no longer shoulder the responsibility of the undeserving president elect and aren t forced to be face to face anymore  unfortunately  it seems that the obamas are far from finished with the trumps   because part of trump s family has dropped a bombshell with the decision to move just three minutes away from them trump s most beloved daughter ivanka has just announced that she and her family will practically be neighbors to the obamas once they leave the white house in less than three weeks  according to the washingtonian  multiple real estate sources  have reported that ivanka and her family will be moving into a    million residence on tracy place in washington  dc   less than two blocks away from where the obamas will be living twitterso just as the obamas thought they might actually be free of trump once he takes the presidency  it looks like that s going to be much harder than they originally planned  as trump will likely be lurking just around the corner at ivanka s house  and obama shouldn t be surprised if one day trump comes around begging him for advice considering he has no idea what the hell he s doing ivanka is moving her family to washington  dc to undoubtedly be closer to her father and provide assistance  just as she was heavily involved in his campaign  currently  trump and his team are trying to find a loophole that will allow ivanka and his son in law jared kushner to have a role in his administration featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
