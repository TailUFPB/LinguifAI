donald trump s join address to congress last night left much to be desired  and many democratic leaders are absolutely disgusted by what they heard and witnessed from the undeserving potus in response to trump s pathetic speech  minority leader of the house of representatives nancy pelosi has received the following statement  which blatantly calls trump out for being untrustworthy and fake  pelosi wrote  the president s speech was utterly disconnected from the cruel reality of his conduct  and she s absolutely right  trump s speech was completely disconnected from what he has done so far  and pelosi accurately assessed trump s address as a  bait and switch assault on america   she also brilliantly pointed out that trump has yet to actually back up any of his campaign promises and proposals pelosi also called trump out for  selling working people down the river to wall street  and for jeopardizing  the security of our country  and weakening  our fight against terror with his administration s dangerous  incompetent and unconstitutional actions   those are harsh words  but they re absolutely true and reflect how the majority of americans feel about trump s first few weeks in the white house  at the end of her statement  pelosi warned trump that  democrats will continue to lead the fight  against his disgusting rhetoric and harmful policies echoing pelosi s statement  colleague chuck schumer also held a similar opinion of trump s address to congress unlike trump  who is infamous for walking back and flip flopping on his stances to please the masses  pelosi only doubled down on her comments earlier this morning in an appearance on msnbc s  morning joe   commenting on trump s lack of concrete policies  she said   we re legislators  show us your proposal  featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
