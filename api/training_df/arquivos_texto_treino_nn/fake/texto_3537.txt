there s a petition on change org going around to stop trump from becoming president  and it has made history  not just for its nature  but because it s the most popular ever seen  at   million signatures and counting  it s over  percent of the way to its goal  and the number of signatories just keeps growing the second most popular petition on change org was to stop a dog meat festival  and had two million fewer signatures  that goes to show the electoral college that a lot of people are looking for any way imaginable to stop trump from actually getting inaugurated on jan     this petition is called  electoral college  make hillary clinton president   and very likely won t work  if for no other reason than republican electors just will not cast their votes for her  that s despite a popular vote lead of over two million  which is a bigger margin and several past presidents  margins of victory  they should make her president based on that  but they ve been conditioned to hate her guts  so no go there  sadly however  we may not need the biggest petition in history to work exactly as planned  because there s a growing coalition of  faithless electors  who won t vote for trump  several democratic electors have gotten together in a mad dash to convince enough other electors to vote against trump before the dec   deadline  they re calling themselves  hamilton electors  after alexander hamilton at least two republican electors from texas have also declared that they can t vote for trump  one  christopher suprun  penned an op ed in the new york times about all the reasons he can t vote for trump  he s also encouraging his fellow electors to reject trump and settle on someone like john kasich  kasich isn t great  but compared to trump  he d be the best president ever perhaps this petition has gotten the attention of some other electors  and they re planning on defecting  too  the sheer magnitude of this petition should send a clear message to them that the people want them to defect  here s hoping they take a good  long look at what they re doing and make their decisions for the good of the country featured image by mark makela getty images
