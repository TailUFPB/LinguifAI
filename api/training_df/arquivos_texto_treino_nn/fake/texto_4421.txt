on thursday night  vice president joe biden joined host jimmy fallon on the tonight show for the very first time  and he did not disappoint biden was his usual charming self  and he continued to captivate the audience throughout the interview  even as he took on a more serious tone when fallon asked him if he watched the debate between donald trump and hillary clinton on monday night  biden admitted that he had watched  and was baffled that trump had even been able to make it as far as the debate stage fallon also asked biden about the constant fact checking that was required whenever trump opened his mouth  and biden made the audience erupt in laughter as he said  i ve never quite seen anything like that  i ve never seen anybody who knew as few facts  biden then brought up his own debate against sarah palin  which had taken place eight years ago  before going right back to critiquing trump s pathetic debate performance and character  in particular  biden called out the shocking moment that trump said he was  smart  for not paying his federal income taxes like the rest of americans  and advised that it was nothing to brag about biden  much like his boss president barack obama  is widely loved and respected by the american people  so his criticism is especially damaging to trump  americans should take note when biden says trump has caused a lot of worry and tension for america s allies  and is putting the reputation of our country in jeopardy  biden said  i ve never known of a candidate who knows as little about the world as this man does  i don t even think he understands how much damage he does by what he already said  biden s right   trump is absolutely clueless and it couldn t have been more obvious after he had to go up against clinton on monday  you can watch biden slam trump below featured image via screen capture
