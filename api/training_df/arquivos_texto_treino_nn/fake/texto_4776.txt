in a speech to the american legion  the largest veteran organization in the country  donald trump alarmingly went full fascist when he promised to  promote pride and patriotism in american schools   when you add that to his attacks on the press  support of nationalists  quoting of dictators  and lack of support for the freedom of speech  the picture that is painted is very clear the troubling remarks began early in his speech  i want to begin by discussing one goal that i know is so important to all of you  promoting american pride and patriotism in america s schools in a trump administration  i plan to work directly with the american legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to america s children  we want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of america s history  its institutions  and its heroes we will stop apologizing for america  and we will start celebrating america we will be united by our common culture  values and principles   becoming one american nation  and if you re one of many parents who have trouble with children mindlessly repeating the pledge of allegiance   many of whom don t know what the words  pledge  and  allegiance  mean   he s got bad news for you  specifically  that flag deserves respect  and i will work with american legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag   and  by the way  we want young americans to recite the pledge of allegiance  in other words  trump wants right wing nationalist propaganda in public schools  that s probably because republicans have a serious problem with history  and an even bigger problem with teaching it to kids  after all  they might learn that the united states is not inherently morally superior and beyond reproach by definition  that s why in   house republicans actually expressed their displeasure with  you know  facts  and passed a resolution saying they don t approve of high school ap history  seriously the following al franken quote comes to mind  you have to love your country like an adult loves somebody  not like a child loves its mommy  and right wing republicans tend to love america like a child loves its mommy  where everything mommy does is okay  but adult love means you re not in denial  and you want the loved one to be the best they can be  that s not the only reason trump s idea is a bad one  it s also illegal  as military times points out public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money  most schools receive little federal funding current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising  any direction  supervision  or control over the curriculum  program of instruction  administration  or personnel of any educational institution  school  or school system  good luck with that  trump you can watch the full video of his speech below featured image via ralph freso getty images
