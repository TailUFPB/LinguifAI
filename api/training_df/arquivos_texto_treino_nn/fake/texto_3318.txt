the  district court in ohio ruled on monday that if a cop comes to your home  they are justified in killing your dog if your dog does so much as move mark and cheryl brown sued the battle creek  michigan police department after  during a search of their homes  the police killed their two pit bulls  all the dogs were guilty of was moving  they argued in court that the officers  actions violated the fourth amendment  that is was an unlawful seizure of property in the case of the browns  two pit bulls  the imminent threat came from the dogs barking and moving around  one officer shot the first pit bull after he said it  had only moved a few inches  in a movement that he considered to be a  lunge   the injured dog retreated to the basement  where the officer shot and killed it as well as the second dog while conducting a sweep of the residence  officer klein testified that after he shot and killed the first dog  he noticed the second dog standing about halfway across the basement   the court s opinion explained   the second dog was not moving towards the officers when they discovered her in the basement  but rather she was  just standing there   barking and was turned sideways to the officers  klein then fired the first two rounds at the second dog  the court  of course  placed the burden on the homeowners  it was up to them to prove that the first dog didn t lunge  how do they prove that   and that the second dog didn t bark while the benefit of the doubt typically goes to police now   they are rarely prosecuted and even more rarely convicted for killing people   it appears that cops can now legally kill dogs  just because they are afraid of them  in fact  nearly  dogs are killed at the hands of police each and every day  this is heartbreaking  expect cops to get even more rights over the people they are supposed to protect under a donald trump presidency featured image via pixabay
