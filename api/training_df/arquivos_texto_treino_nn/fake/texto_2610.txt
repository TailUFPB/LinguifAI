when donald trump was campaigning he said something chilling  something that was widely dismissed as  all bluster   that to deal with terrorism  you have to slaughter their families  the other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families  when you get these terrorists  you have to take out their families  they care about their lives  don t kid yourself  when they say they don t care about their lives  you have to take out their families   trump told fox and friends as he promised he would not fight a  very politically correct war  in his very first raid as president  he showed the world that he meant it  the operation was approved over dinner without adequate planning or intelligence  in any sense   and it was a disaster from the very beginning according to reports from locals  the first person hit was  year old ahmed abdelilah ahmed al dahab  who heard commotion outside and went to check what was happening  when my son ahmed saw them  he couldn t tell that they were soldiers because it was dark   the boy s father says   he asked them  who are you   but the men shot him  he was the first killed  no one thought that marines would descend on our homes to kill us  kill our children and kill our women   another member of his family   year old nasser  was killed one woman  fatim saleh al ameri  was shot while trying to flee with her two year old son   we pulled him out from his mother s lap  he was covered in her blood   said  year old basil ahmed abad al  zouba  whose  year old brother was killed in trump s folly abdallah al ameri  who had years earlier survived a u s  attack on his wedding party of which he was not the target  was killed along with his  year old daughter fatima and  year old son mohammed  three of mohammed s children    year old aisha   year old khadija  and  year old hussein  another nine members of his family were killed in the raid  including  year old halima and  year old mursil  i was woken up after midnight by the bombing of the helicopters  there were soldiers on the ground shooting at us  they started shooting at us with machine gun fire   witness fahad ali al ameri says of the attack  his three month old daughter asma fahad ali al ameri was killed in her crib  asleep also killed was the eight year old daughter of an al qaeda propagandist  american citizen nawar anwar al awlaqi  who was hiding in a building at the time   some of the gunfire went through the windows and nawar was injured in her neck   her uncle  whom she was visiting  says     we tried to save her but we couldn t do anything for her  it is true they were targeting al qaeda but why did they have to kill children and women and elderly people   said zabnallah saif al ameri  if such slaughter happened in their country  there would be a lot of shouting about human rights  when our children are killed  they are quiet  trump s raid failed to kill the primary target  qassim al rimi  who is currently taunting  easy d  in propaganda videos  but did manage to snag three super important videos that are about a decade old and available on youtube  the tradeoff for this disaster was about  dead militants and  noncombatants as well as a member of seal team  because of this disaster  yemen has withdrawn permission for the united states to conduct anti terror operations in the country  thus damaging our ability to combat extremism naturally  trump called this massive boner a  success  featured image via the bureau
