immigration and customs enforcement  better known by the acronym ice  have approached the national archives and record administration  nara   seeking an approval for their timetable in which they can destroy records in relation to their detention operations nara is an independent agency of the united states government whose main responsibility is preserving and documenting government and historical records  as well as increasing public access to documents of which the national archives are comprised  on this particular occasion  however  ice isn t asking nara for advice about matters of record keeping efficiency  but rather for approval to erase a long documented history of human rights and constitutional abuse if trump and his crew have their way  the sheer amount of immigrants in detention is going to increase exponentially  while the conditions of the locations where detainees are housed will get worse  so it is important that these records are kept available  but what exactly is the paper trail that ice is trying to cover up many organizations and advocates have been decrying and trying to draw attention to the issue of abuse of basic human rights in the detention system for years and it turns out they have more than just a strong case  ice has requested permission from nara to routinely destroy official records from  different categories  mainly consisting of those that offer proof of the mistreatment endured by detainees  such as records related to sexual assaults  solitary confinement and  most importantly  the deaths of people in ice custody  the other records ice are campaigning to dispose of on a relatively frequent basis are regular detention monitoring reports  logs about detainees in ice facilities and communications from the public reporting detention abuses what is even more disturbing is it looks like nara is going to approve ice s request and their reasons for doing so are simply horrendous  through the eyes of nara  records relating to cases of sexual assault and even death of detainees do not document significant actions of federal officials   despite the fact that there have been  deaths in immigration detention in the past  months  when it comes to cases of sexual assault  nara claims the  information is highly sensitive and does not warrant retention  if ice gets their way  which is more than likely  their plan is to be able to destroy sexual assault and death records after  years and reports about solitary confinement after only three years  removing their criminal paper trail completely from the public eye over time featured image via anthony devlin getty images
