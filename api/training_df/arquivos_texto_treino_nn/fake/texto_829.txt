according to the results from a recent survey by public policy polling  only  percent of donald trump voters polled wholeheartedly believe that donald trump jr  met with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya  despite the fact that the u s  president s eldest son has openly admitted doing so president trump s alleged collusion with russia has been one of the main stories doing the rounds since before his inauguration  but more fuel was added to the fire when the new york times broke the news at the beginning of the month of donald trump jr  s meeting with veselnitskaya  a russian lawyer with ties to russian leader vladimir putin  and six others in an effort to obtain damaging information about his father s campaign rival  hillary clinton  back in june  donald trump jr  has since admitted that the meeting took place and has even given details of the attendees  including former trump campaign chairman paul manafort and trump s son in law and now senior adviser  jared kushner  however  many trump voters aren t so sure despite these admissions from the man himself   percent of the trump voters surveyed believe that the meetings didn t happen at all and a further  percent weren t entirely sure  to make matters even worse   percent believed the whole story about russia meddling in last years presidential election to be  fake news   while only  percent disagreed entirely with that notion some other points of interest that came from the results of the trump voters surveyed but it isn t all bad news  the very same survey showed that only  percent of his surveyed voters approve of the job he s doing  whereas  percent don t  to make matters worse  just  percent of his voters consider trump to be honest  but  percent say he isn t  and  percent call him an outright liar  while only  percent disagree with that label being used to describe the president  so there is hope featured image via jeff vinnick getty images
