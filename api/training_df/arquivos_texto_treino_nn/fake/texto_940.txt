white house officials are now saying trump won t make a trip to england this summer after a hurried  secret plan to sneak the president into the country was leaked to the english press causing widespread outrage trump s unpopularity in the united kingdom is legendary  and his aversion to protesters has caused him to refuse to visit the nation until they can guarantee there won t be mass protests  but his staff apparently came up with a gamble that would allow him to meet with british prime minister theresa may while avoiding the backlash  unfortunately for him  it fell through almost immediately trump wanted to visit his golf course in scotland  because  of course  while he was in europe for the  meeting and the plan was to have him quietly pop over to london so he could meet with may  to avoid any chance of protests  trump s staff is said to have warned british officials that the president would only be giving  hour notice before dropping by  this way  they reasoned  protesters wouldn t even know he was in the country before he was leaving again whitehall sources confirmed the government had been warned that the president could visit turnberry  one of his two golf resorts in scotland  during his trip to europe  between attending the  summit in hamburg and joining celebrations for bastille day in france on  july trump would be expected to come to downing street to meet the prime minister for informal talks as part of any such visit  though final confirmation would be likely to be given with just  hours  notice to minimise the risk of disruption but like everything with trump s flailing administration  the plan leaked to the press and protesters vowed to be ready  even at short notice so the white house is back to saying he won t be visiting our ally after all  at least not this summer a spokeswoman for the us president said on monday that no trip was imminent  amid mounting speculation that trump was planning to make an unofficial visit to the uk on his way to or from the  summit in hamburg this week  while we look forward to visiting the uk  it will not happen in the next two weeks   the spokeswoman said it s doubtful that the white house s denials are going to make any would be protesters put their guard down  the trump administration has such a deep reputation of lying  that a denial from them means absolutely nothing  it s likely that angry english citizens will gather at trump s scottish golf course while trump is in europe juussstttt in case  and trump has a notoriously hard time resisting a game of golf meanwhile  trump is getting ready to meet his on again  off again friend vladimir putin at the  summit  his advisers told cnn that the president is not planning to bring up the fact that russia hacked the u s  elections  nevertheless  it will certainly be the elephant in the room featured image via mark wilson getty images
