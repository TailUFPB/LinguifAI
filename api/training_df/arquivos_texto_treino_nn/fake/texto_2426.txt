we are stuck with donald trump as the most dangerous and incompetent president in history for either the next four years or until he is impeached  if he is impeached  we re stuck with a bona fide theocrat in mike pence  it didn t have to be this way  though  and we quite possibly have one man to thank for it  federal bureau of investigation director james comey by now  we are all aware that the insane probe into hillary clinton s private email server was closed in july  despite much gop hand wringing  it was found that there was nothing to see there  however  despite his decision not to pursue criminal charges  comey took an unprecedented step and held a press conference telling the american people that hillary was reckless in her actions in a scathing rebuke that  of course  would turn voters who were on the fence against her  in addition to that  just eleven days out from election day  comey sent a letter to congress  which of course made it into the press  saying that he may be re opening the probe due to some nonsense about hillary s aide  huma abedin  and her husband anthony weiner s computer in a completely unrelated investigation  of course  nothing was there  but the damage was already done  this could very well be what tipped the election in favor of donald trump in the minds of undecided voters  after all  plenty of people made up their minds at the last minute one attorney is  quote   appalled  at comey s actions  after filing a freedom of information act request to have the warrant for hillary s emails released  randy schoenberg of los angeles  california  says of what the fbi director did  via usa today  i see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause  nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the fbi had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime  nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between  clinton and abedin  schoenberg said in an email to usa today  it remains unknown  why they thought they might find evidence of a crime  why they felt it necessary to inform congress  and why they even sought this search warrant   he said   i am appalled   the fbi s manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment brian fallon  who of course was a clinton campaign official  echoed these sentiments via twitter  saying that unsealed filings regarding huma s emails reveals comey s intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time  so  in other words  it is very possible that comey did this in an effort to tip the scales in trump s favor  then again  considering that there was an entire article written during the campaign saying that the  fbi is trumpland  this really should be no surprise whatsoever  if they wanted to tilt things to trump  they had the perfect way to do it  especially considering all of the horrible news coming out about trump these revelations are especially damning  considering that it has now been revealed that the fbi withheld information regarding an investigation into trump and his campaign s ties to russia  to that end  comey definitely messed with our democracy in what is beginning to look like a criminal act  they hated hillary so much at the fbi that the director himself manipulated the electoral process to give us a trump presidency james comey needs to be investigated himself  but of course that isn t going to happen under a gop white house  department of justice  and congress shame on you  director comey  representative maxine waters was right   you have no credibility  and should resign immediately featured image via win mcnamee getty images
