in the aftermath of the historic flooding that accompanied hurricane harvey s high winds and torrential rains  there was a surprising effect on the arkema chemical plant east of houston on greens bayou  the facility was inundated with so much water that it lost power  and that s when the chemical reactions began  when stored at improper temperatures  the organic peroxides at arkema are unstable  leading to  popping  sounds  smoke  and eventually fire those fires emitted a smoke that many in the area described differently  harris county sheriff ed gonzalez said the emissions were like standing over a barbecue pit or something like that  where you get smoke in your eyes   according to nbc news  richard rennard  a representative of arkema  described what came from the plant a little more cautiously  noxious  certainly  i don t know the composition of the smoke a deputy was  in fact  taken to the hospital after inhaling the fumes coming from the plant but after officials warned everyone in a nearly two mile radius that more explosions could follow  questions about whether the plant was following proper safety protocols began to arise  that s when arkema s connection to the trump epa came to light the international business times got their hands on federal records that showed arkema successfully lobbied epa chief scott pruitt and a number of republicans in an effort to delay new safety regulations for chemical plants that were passed by the obama administration  those rules  crafted after the chemical plant disaster in west  texas  miles from houston  would have taken effect in march  they also would have directly affected arkema in their letter opposing the new regulations  arkema used standard conservative trope  that the rules would  likely add significant new costs and burdens to the corporate audit process   those costs  of course  would be on top of the more than    in osha fines assessed to the crosby arkema plant this year alone  all for  serious  violations  but it was nonetheless arkema s conclusion that  the final rule includes a litany of costly changes that have not been shown to increase safety  that seems a little less than true at this point although texas governor greg abbott has blocked public access to state records of just what chemicals are stored in which facilities  the ap reported that the arkema plant also housed sulfur dioxide and methylpropen  which are  respectively  toxic and flammable  storage of these chemicals would have required arkema to file a risk management plan with the epa   which would have triggered the new obama era rules if trump hadn t struck them down  that is featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
