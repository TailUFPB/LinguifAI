if donald trump doesn t want to be booed or lampooned over the next four years he should start acting presidential instead of like a big baby instead of putting on his big boy pants and accepting the reality that people are going to boo him and mike pence for the way they have treated others  trump chose to lash out after hearing that pence was booed by the audience at a performance of  hamilton  on broadway but trump focused his ire on the cast for reading a message to pence at the end of the play our wonderful future v p  mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton  cameras blazing this should not happen   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    theater must always be a safe and special place the cast of hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man  mike pence  apologize   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    cast and producers of hamilton  which i hear is highly overrated  should immediately apologize to mike pence for their terrible behavior  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    trump s claims  the cast of  hamilton  did not disrespect mike pence  they merely expressed their hope that he learned something by watching the play and the hope that he will be a vice president for everyone  and even mike pence has twice said that he wasn t offended  so  mike pence wasn t offended and donald trump was   kimmel said   why do i feel like we re going to see a lot more of this dynamic  who gets into a fight with a musical   kimmel continued   how is it possible that donald trump can get along with putin but not  hamilton  kimmel went on to say that if trump really wants  hamilton  to apologize he should apologize to the long list of people he insulted and offended over the last year and a half and proceeded to run that list on the screen here s the video via youtube donald trump cannot continue lashing out every time he he thinks someone is disrespecting him  we have freedom of speech in this country and our leaders are supposed to be busy running the nation instead of ordering people to be nice to them  the bottom line is that the level of disrespect towards trump is nowhere near to how conservatives have treated president obama for the last eight years  so trump should stop being a total hypocrite  and if he can t do that he should step aside  tell the electors he can t do this job  and allow an adult like hillary clinton to do it featured image  screenshot
