if donald trump has his way  the constitutional right to due process will only belong to white racists in the wake of the bombing in new york city over the weekend  police were able to apprehend a suspect named ahmad khan rahami after a shootout rahami was hit and needed to be hospitalized to get his gunshot wound treated  and as an american citizen  he is also guaranteed the right to an attorney even if he cannot afford one why  because the fifth and sixth amendments of the constitution say so but republican nominee donald trump thinks the amendments should be scrapped in rahami s case  you know  because he s a muslim during a rally in florida on monday  trump whined because rahami is being treated in a hospital for his wound and further complained about him being represented by a competent defense attorney  now we will give him amazing hospitalization  he will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world  he will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room  and he ll probably even have room service  knowing the way our country is  and on top of all of that  he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer  his case will go through the various court systems for years and in the end  people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been  what a sad situation  trump  who advocates for torture techniques  also demanded a speedy trial resulting in  harsh punishment  and suggested using  whatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before it s no longer timely  here s the video via youtube the fifth amendment states no person shall be held to answer for a capital  or otherwise infamous crime  unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury nor be deprived of life  liberty  or property  without due process of law  nor shall private property be taken for public use  without just compensation rahami is innocent until proven guilty  so not letting him get the treatment he needs could lead to him dying from an infection or loss of blood  thus depriving him of life without due process furthermore  the sixth amendment clearly gives everyone the right to an attorney  even a bombing suspect in all criminal prosecutions  the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial  by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed  which district shall have been previously ascertained by law  and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation  to be confronted with the witnesses against him  to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor  and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense the right to have an attorney is one of the most foundational values of the country  most exemplified by founding father john adams  who defended the british soldiers who were arrested after the boston massacre in  in short  it doesn t matter who the suspect is or what they did  they have the right to due process and an attorney in this country  but donald trump apparently wants to put a  white s only  sign on the constitution featured image via screen capture
