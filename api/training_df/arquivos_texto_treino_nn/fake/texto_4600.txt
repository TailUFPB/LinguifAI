with absolutely no shame or apology  republican presidential nominee donald trump finally admitted to the american public that president obama was  in fact  born in the united states of america despite his repeated efforts to prove otherwise  it s now not as politically convenient for trump to still push this issue considering he now has to try to win over the opposing side of the topic trump said  president obama was born in the united states  period  now  we want to get back to making america strong and great again  profound  really  and absolutely pathetic here s the thing  though  trump is full of absolute horseshi t because he was the birther in chief back half a decade ago  even going so far as to claim credit for the fact that obama released his birth certificate  and even after that  trump still had his many doubts over its authenticity there s even video of him from  stating how much he believes this is a very valid issue that needs to be looked into  he even went so far as to say calling those who wanted to see the birth certificate  birthers  was  derogatory  because they re actually  on to something  and ever the political opportunist  he said  people love this issue   especially in the republican party  so  when you hear trump say that  president obama was born in the united states  period   remember what he really thought and likely still thinks  you can also tell he s doing it for pandering purposes because he ended his announcement with his damn campaign slogan those who haven t caught on to how absolutely smarmy trump is  need to wake up and wake up fast kyle griffin of msnbc s last word posted the video on twitter trump on birtherism in    people love this issue   especially in the republican party   https   t co  pic twitter com   kyle griffin     september    image via video screen capture
