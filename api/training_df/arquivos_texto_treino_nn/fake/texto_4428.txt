in an unusual and shocking move  the editorial board of usa today did something no one say coming  for the first time in their  year history  they broke their rule of neutrality  and blasted republican presidential candidate donald trump never before taking any side   let alone taking a position of any sort   the board labeled trump a danger to america  writing that his  erratic    ill equipped  personality  as well as his  checkered  business past  disqualify him from the presidency writing not in support of clinton but rather in sheer resentment of trump  the board blasted the nominee for his unconventional and downright  prejudiced  ways this year  the choice isn t between two capable major party nominees who happen to have significant ideological differences  this year  one of the candidates   republican nominee donald trump   is  by unanimous consensus of the editorial board  unfit for the presidency   he has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the temperament  knowledge  steadiness and honesty that america needs from its presidents the board called on voters   much like ted cruz did at the rnc   to vote their conscience and follow their convictions  asking them to  resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue   and  by all means vote  just not for donald trump  one of the biggest reasons for the plea of deflection is due in part to trump s misguided and dangerous view of the world  from his blunders on nato to his high regard for vladimir putin trump s foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent  it s not just democrats who say this  scores of republican national security leaders have signed an extraordinary open letter calling trump s foreign policy vision  wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle   in a wall street journal column this month  robert gates  the highly respected former defense secretary who served presidents of both parties over a half century  described trump as  beyond repair  the stinging rebuke comes just days after vice presidential candidate mike pence penned an op ed in the newspaper outlining why voters should choose trump and himself talk about great timing usa today s half endorsement  half non endorsement follows a slew of newspaper who are famously bucking donald trump  and instead endorsing clinton   usa today s editorial board expressed deep concerns for hillary clinton  citing her emails  her candor  and issues with her entitlement nonetheless  the board sent a strong message in an age of neutrality  the stakes could not be higher  and we as a nation cannot take a risk with donald trump in the white house much like the onslaught received by the arizona republic  usa today is sure to feel the wrath of trump supporters in the coming days  however  a poll on the paper s website asks readers if they agree with the board s decision or not  out of almost nine thousand votes  so far    percent agree that s a good start good for the usa today editorial board   they have a backbone  and it s about time those in the media stand up to the racist  fear mongering bully that is donald j  trump featured image via joe readle getty images
