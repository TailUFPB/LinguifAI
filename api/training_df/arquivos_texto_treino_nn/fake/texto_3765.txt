what could possibly go wrong rep  mike pompeo is a right wing extremist who has no problem violating human and civil rights but donald trump just picked the kansas republican to be the next director of the cia  which should deeply disturb every american in fact  it should worry everyone around the world because the tea party is now in charge of america s top intelligence agency  i am honored to have been given this opportunity to serve and to work alongside president elect donald j  trump to keep america safe   pompeo said in a statement   i also look forward to working with america s intelligence warriors  who do so much to protect americans each and every day  but pompeo isn t a reasonable man who will guide the cia to success  he s going to lead them down a path that will erode the rights of american citizens and inflame the muslim world first  pompeo supports the massive wire tapping and information collecting being performed by the national security agency  i am convinced that intelligence collection actions are not only lawful and constitutional  but also consistent with the critical mission of defeating radical islamic terrorism   pompeo has said of course  these  collection actions  are totally unconstitutional because the nsa doesn t have warrants to spy on millions of americans every day via phone  internet  and surveillance second  pompeo hates iran and opposed the nuclear deal achieved by president obama that has reduced iran s capability to build nuclear weapons  if pompeo had his way  the whole deal would be ripped up  which would give iran another reason to hate us and resume their quest to obtain a nuclear weapon and finally  pompeo is a big fan of using torture against enemy combatants even though it s a crime against humanity that is banned under united states and international law  the information we learned from the enhanced interrogation program was important  and led directly to the capture of osama bin laden   pompeo claimed in   but that s a lie  torture did not help us find osama bin laden according to mother jones cia records indicate that     the cia had extensive reporting on  abu ahmad al kuwaiti  variant abu ahmed al kuwaiti   the ubl facilitator whose identification and tracking led to the identification of ubl s compound and the operation that resulted in ubl s death  prior to and independent of information from cia detainees     the most accurate information on abu ahmad al kuwaiti obtained from a cia detainee was provided by a cia detainee who had not yet been subjected to the cia s enhanced interrogation techniques  and    cia detainees who were subjected to the cia s enhanced interrogation techniques withheld and fabricated information about abu ahmad al kuwaiti in short  torture had nothing to do with finding bin laden if pompeo and trump authorize the cia to use torture again it will only inflame the middle east and give isis a recruiting message that will draw more fighters to their group  we want to weaken isis  not make them stronger  using torture will only weaken our moral high ground and cause more terrorist attacks around the world and in the united states  now more than ever we need a responsible cia director who will gather intelligence the right way  because if not  we could end up being led into more wars and a darker more dangerous world featured image  flickr
