christian cake baker jack phillips gained national infamy when he violated colorado s non discrimination law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple s wedding  he was subsequently sued  and now his case is headed to the supreme court  unfortunately  with the current makeup of the court and donald trump s administration in place  it is quite likely that discrimination will be codified into law  nonetheless  the satanic temple has come up with a brilliant way to point out that religious freedom cuts both ways  by having these bigoted bakers make cakes for satan jack phillips has already had his first request via email from a satanist seeking to celebrate satan  it reads dear mr phillipsi would like to get a quote on a birthday cake  for a special event  it is a cake that is religious in theme  and since religion is a protected class  i am hoping that you will gladly bake this cake  as you see the birthday cake in question is to celebrate the birthday of lucifer  or as they are also known satan who was born as satan when he was cast from heaven by god  the cake only needs to be a simple   single layer cake  with red and black icing  as well as to contain an upside down cross  under the head of lucifer  and i thought i would seek you out  to bake this cake since you appear to be a very moral person since you refused to bake a cake for same sex couples  and since religion is a protected class  i hope you will be willing to bake this cake  so my small group of religious friends can celebrate the birthday of lucifer this coming november  just a few days after halloween sincerely  name redacted here is a sample cake posted to twitter by the satanic temple s co founder  lucien greaves did you know  bakers can t refuse service to the satanic temple because religion is a  protected class    satancakes pic twitter com   lucien greaves   luciengreaves  september    whole point here is not to torment bakers or anyone else  it is to point out that if you own a business that is open to the public  you may not discriminate  period  now  at the federal level there are no non discrimination protections for lgbtq people  however  religion   every religion   is a protected class  if jack phillips or anyone else refuses the satanists their cakes  this will be an open and shut court case mr  phillips  it would have been a hell of a lot easier if you had just baked the damn wedding cake here is video of the temple s co founder explaining his position featured image via video screen capture
