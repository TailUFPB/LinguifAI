the naacp issued a statement following the firing of steve bannon  donald trump s racist chief strategist  on friday afternoon  the organization explained that while they are certainly glad to see bannon go  it doesn t change the fact that the sitting president is still a raging bigot  the naacp is glad to see steve bannon out of the white house   derrick johnson  the group s interim president and ceo said in a statement  ousting one key staffer  however  can t erase the words used by president trump this week in defense of domestic terrorists  neo nazis and white supremacists  president trump provided permission for these hate groups to exist  bannon left his job at the right wing propoganda site  breitbart news  to sign on as trump s campaign manager and then became the alleged president s chief strategist following the election  as a well known racist and anti semite  bannon was widely accepted as the bigoted mastermind behind much of trump s most racist rhetoric and policies in the statement  the naacp also called on trump to fire the rest of  the people who share steve bannon s poisonous beliefs  including senior policy adviser stephen miller and national security aide sebastian gorka bannon s firing came after racial tensions in the u s  reached a fevered pitch following the white supremacist rally in charlottesville  virginia that left a counter protester dead  trump has repeatedly failed to convincingly denounce these hate groups  instead  he has chosen to argue that  both sides  were responsible for the violence and accused counter protesters of violently attacking the poor innocent nazis  which has lead to widespread outrage the naacp is absolutely right  bannon was just one of many racists in trump s white house and his departure surely doesn t fix the overall problem  which is that trump himself holds these same bigoted beliefs featured image via zach gibson   pool getty images
