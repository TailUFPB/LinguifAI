the protest is growing most people don t seem to understand that freedom and liberty is a two way street  that when soldiers fight and die for our rights they did so for all of them at least that s what conservatives don t understand since they ve been critical almost to the point of calling for violence against san francisco  quarterback colin kaepernick for not standing during the national anthem in protest of police brutality  i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color   kaepernick told the press following a game last month   to me  this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way  there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder  kaepernick has been joined in his protest by other athletes  but now he has the support of one of the biggest stars in women s soccer megan rapinoe plays on the united states national women s team on the world stage  including the olympic games  and on sunday  she became the highest profile white athlete to protest inequality in america by refusing to stand for the national anthem when the anthem began playing rapinoe simply took a knee  and her action brought even more attention to the issues kaepernick is raising  it was a little nod to kaepernick and everything that he s standing for right now   rapinoe told the media   i think it s actually pretty disgusting the way he was treated and the way that a lot of the media has covered it and made it about something that it absolutely isn t  we need to have a more thoughtful  two sided conversation about racial issues in this country  in addition to racial issues  rapinoe s kneel also drew attention to lgbt issues such as discrimination  being a gay american  i know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties  it was something small that i could do and something that i plan to keep doing in the future and hopefully spark some meaningful conversation around it  it s important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this  we don t need to be the leading voice  of course  but standing in support of them is something that s really powerful  if the american flag really stands for  liberty and justice for all  we wouldn t be seeing police officers unjustly killing black people in the streets and we wouldn t see conservatives constantly trying to pass new laws in order to legalize discrimination against gay people but we are seeing these injustices take place and until they are fixed perhaps it s time we shelve the national anthem until the flag has earned back its respect featured image via twitter
