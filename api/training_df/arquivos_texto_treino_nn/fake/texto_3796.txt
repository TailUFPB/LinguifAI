just like trump campaign manager kellyanne conway did on fox news sunday  cnn pundit and trump mouthpiece kayleigh mcenany went full hypocrite on tuesday earlier this week  donald trump named white supremacist hero steve bannon as his chief policy strategist  basically guaranteeing that we won t be seeing any legislation that helps minorities in this country  in fact  we ll probably see some landmark legislation like the civil rights act get rolled back make no mistake  bannon is a racist with ties to white nationalists  but kayleigh mcenany not only whined about bannon being called a racist by fellow panelist jonathan tasini  she had the nerve to repeat the call for unity even though republicans refused to unite behind president obama when he asked the country to come together in  the discussion began with van jones pointing out that if hillary clinton picked the editor of a maoist publication to be her chief strategist republicans would be throwing a hissy fit  we ve got to continue to have a serious debate about the direction of our country and that includes talking about who s put in the inner circle of the president of the united states   jones said mcenany replied that  there is a line between asking a question and labeling someone a racist  which is what jonathan just did  van  as political commentators  we have a duty and an obligation  van  to correct mistruths and falsehoods  we have an obligation to correct falsehoods and president barack obama stood up there and said it s time to unite and that means dispelling these rumors  but these are not rumors  bannon has been flirting with the alt right for years and it s no coincidence that white supremacists flocked to trump s campaign because bannon was part of it  white nationalists see bannon as their meal ticket to power  which makes him all the more dangerous anyway  tasini was absolutely disgusted by mcenany s defense of bannon  so he proceeded to bury her  bannon is a racist and an anti semite   tasini said   he s at the head of an alt right movement that is completely anti american  frankly  you should be ashamed of yourself that you re justifying what he s about  i m very proud of this campaign   mcenany responded  i know you re proud and that s a disgrace   tasini said  driving a final stake of humiliation through mcenany s hypocrisy here s the video via vid me again  for eight years conservatives refused to unite behind president obama and called him every name in the book  they even called him a secret muslim who hates america  i don t remember republicans working to  correct falsehoods and mistruths  then  yet trump and his deplorable supporters have the gall to ask for unity now  f ck that shit   notmypresidentfeatured image  screenshot
