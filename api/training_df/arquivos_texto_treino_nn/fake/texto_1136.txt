despite all the evidence otherwise  donald trump is still claiming that he doesn t believe russia actually hacked our election  a report in the wall street journal reveals that even though  intelligence agencies agree that russia was behind the hacking of the democratic national committee during the  election  trump still isn t convinced according to the wsj  sources say that there is a memo of conversations between trump and nsa director adm  rogers which detail trump s refusal to acknowledge that russia meddled in the presidential election  this memo reveals that the president questioned the veracity of the intelligence community s judgment that russia had interfered with the election and also tried to persuade adm  rogers to say there was no evidence of collusion between the campaign and russian officials  but on june   just one day before fired fbi director james comey told the senate intelligence committee all about how trump tried to obstruct justice in every way he could  adm  rogers said he felt zero pressure from trump  to push back against allegations of possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia  trump refuses to say that russia interfered with our election for obvious reasons  admitting that russia did all they could to rig the election in his favor is the very last thing he wants to do there hasn t been any doubt that russia meddled in the election for months now  way back in january  the office of the director of national intelligence released a report that  pins responsibility for the election attack directly on president vladimir v  putin of russia  ruling out the possibility that it was ordered by intelligence officials or simply carried out by kremlin supporters   a whopping  intelligence agencies agree on this matter  it isn t up for debate anymore  russia  hacked  our  election however  trump just can t bring himself to say that  i guess it s too close to a confession featured image via alex wong getty images
