trump s biggest  and most insane  surrogate rudy giuliani just got some bad news   his daughter  caroline  is backing democratic nominee hillary clinton for president over donald trump  her father s new bff after posting on her facebook that she has been  pro hillary all along   and making her profile picture clinton s iconic h  giuliani confirmed that the account was indeed hers and that her father  rudy  does know i love hillary  i think she s by far the most qualified candidate that we ve had in a long while  my dad knows  i was for barack in   he knows and is fully comfortable with it and thinks i have a right to my opinion she did not comment on her father s surrogacy or support for trump  on her facebook  after sharing an article titled   i wrote that i despised hillary clinton  today  i publicly want to take that back   giuliani wrote i ve been pro hillary all along  but the people who are willing to open their minds   shift their perspectives are the ones with the power to save our country at this point  so i really respect this    imwithher  voteaccording to politico the younger giuliani is not the only one who has drifted from her father this election   the new york times reported that many of the former mayor s most loyal former aides have rejected trump s candidacy  and have expressed concerns about giuliani s embrace of the manhattan mogul and his more extreme views  specifically on immigration  some of his former staffers  like his onetime press secretary matt higgins  have endorsed clinton it seems like rudy is really off his rocker when everyone around him  including his own family  are voting for the other candidate one has to wonder what trump promised or paid giuliani for his ardent  and downright insane  support featured image via matt millis mcknight getty images
