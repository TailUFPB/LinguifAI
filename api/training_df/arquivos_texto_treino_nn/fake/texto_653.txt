last time i checked  throwing a temper tantrum isn t considered  working  but that s what donald trump did from his golf resort at bedminster  new jersey on monday morning after the new york times called him out for whining trump  of course  responded by whining about the media and claimed that his base is stronger than ever despite several polls showing that his base is starting to abandon him the failing  nytimes  which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win  apologized   is totally inept   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    trump base is far bigger   stronger than ever before  despite some phony fake news polling   look at rallies in penn  iowa  ohio    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    then desperately tried to make it sounds like he has accomplished things and called the russia scandal  fake news    and west virginia  the fact is the fake news russian collusion story  record stock market  border security  military strength  jobs     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august     supreme court pick  economic enthusiasm  deregulation   so much more have driven the trump base even closer together  will never change   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    to believe that with    fake news on cnn  abc  nbc  cbs  nytimes   wapo  the trump base is getting stronger   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    trump had the audacity to claim that he is  working hard  even though he is playing golf working hard from new jersey while white house goes through long planned renovation  going to new york next week for more meetings   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    is currently on a  day vacation  which is twice as long as president obama s first big vacation during his first year in office  while president obama was capable of running the country and taking a break at the time  trump has proven that running the country does not interest him near as much as playing golf does  and trump already neglects most of his duties anyway and spends his mornings on twitter instead of doing his job the bottom line is that trump has not signed a single piece of major legislation and is taking credit for obama s economy  all the jobs numbers and stock market gains trump has been bragging about are a continuation of obama s economic achievements and continuing to deny that his campaign colluded with russia is seriously childish considering trump s own son released emails proving that trump campaign members did  indeed  meet with russians to get dirt on hillary clinton from the russian government it looks like even general john kelly is incapable of keeping trump from throwing a hissy fit on twitter featured image via ian macnicol getty images
