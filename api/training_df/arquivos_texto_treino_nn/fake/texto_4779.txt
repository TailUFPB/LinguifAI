in an appearance on nbc s  meet the press   mike pence promised to do something that people have clamored for trump to do for months  it s simple   he plans to release his tax returns  within the next week  which is far sooner than anything we can ever expect from the donald of course  despite shaming the hell out of his running mate like this  pence still had to say that trump will make good on his promise  too  donald trump and i are both going to release our tax returns  i ll release mine in the next week donald trump will be releasing his tax returns at the completion of an audit  what baloney  the audit is an excuse  trump can release his tax returns despite the audit  he just won t  richard nixon  arguably our most dishonest president ever  released his returns under audit  apparently  though  trump hiding them and being as opaque as possible is on the advice of an adviser  it s not hard  however  to believe this adviser would tell him   don t release any information that makes you look bad in any way   yet much of the public is wondering what he s hiding in there  including many in his own party both hillary and her running mate  tim kaine  have already released their tax returns  further shaming the trumpmeister  that s expected  though  one hardly expects one s own running mate to do the same thing hillary and bill clinton paid an effective tax rate of just over  percent  maybe trump is worried how much of the world will see how he evades taxes  or that he s lied about being able to get away with paying a very low tax rate  or both  in that very vein  trump himself has rather hypocritically said  so you know if you re running  at a minimum  probably you re going to have to show your returns  if you didn t see the tax returns you would think there s almost like something wrong  what s wrong  so what s wrong with the donald that he won t release his tax returns  he s eating his own words  the fact that his own running mate is willing to do this  while he himself is not  is laughable at best  no doubt they think this will bring some credibility back to their campaign  but it will also make lots of people turn back to trump and say   show us your taxes  now that your own running mate has done it  of course pence tried to cover for that  but either he is lying through his teeth and has no intention of releasing his returns next week  or he s about to make trump look really  really bad featured image by bill pugliano getty images
