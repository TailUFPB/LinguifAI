gay johnson appeared on cnn s reliable sources sunday morning where he made a gaffe that might just end his campaign  during an interview  johnson said that he is  just grateful that nobody got hurt  during a bomb explosion in new york city saturday night  johnson appeared to be unaware that  people were injured in the blast  first of all   just grateful that nobody got hurt   johnson said   secondly  law enforcement is on the scene  responders are on the scene  if there s anything i learned having been governor of new mexico for eight years is that these people really do care  they are really qualified  look  we re going to find out who is responsible   johnson continued   whether it s an individual or a group  they will be brought to justice  and that is something that all of us demand  all of us  this is the second time that johnson made an egregious error during a media appearance  earlier in september  johnson was questioned on how he would deal with the refugee crisis in the syrian city of aleppo  johnson responded by asking  what is aleppo   the gaffe was pretty bad but it didn t appear to hurt him in the polls while i would prefer  marginally so  a johnson administration to the nightmare that a trump administration would be  this is not the type of mistake that a serious political candidate should ever make  leaders need to be informed about a situation in order to respond accordingly  this is information that johnson should have been aware of johnson did not reach the threshold needed to in the polls to take a podium in the upcoming presidential debates  that fact made johnson s already incredibly slim chance of actually winning the election to an impossibility as others have noted johnson may very well end up being the determining factor in this year s presidential election  this gaffe may very well take some of his influence away he has in determining the outcome  should it be enough for his supporters to defect to either major candidate s campaign you can watch the video below featured image from video screenshot
