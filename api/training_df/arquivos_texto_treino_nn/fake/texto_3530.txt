for the second time in as many weeks  trump s twitter feed has been filled with bravado over his job saving and job creating expertise  first  it was carrier  it turned out to be a lie and a bad deal all around  but that didn t stop trump from bragging that he saved   jobs on tuesday  trump announced via twitter that a japanese company called softbank was ready to move   jobs to the united states  naturally  trump took credit for it masa  softbank  of japan has agreed to invest   billion in the u s  toward businesses and   new jobs    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december     realdonaldtrump  masa said he would never do this had we  trump  not won the election   trump for president     december    also held a press conference in front of trump tower saying  ladies and gentlemen  this is masa from japan   trump told reporters at trump tower as he introduced ceo masayoshi son  whose company  softbank  owns sprint   he s just agreed to invest   billion in the united states and   jobs  he s one of the great men of industry  so i just want to thank you very much  thank you  source  politicohere s the video anyone who s followed business or has ever taken a business class knows that it s impossible to iron out a deal like this in just a few weeks  well  that s because it hasn t been ironed out and  well  it s been in the works since october sunbank is not a bank  they are a technology company with a majority ownership in sprint  they had previously tried to merge with t mobile but gave up after obama expressed a concern about growing telecom monopolies  this is likely the reason son is excited about trump s presidency in october  softbank announced the creation of a   billion fund  backed by saudi arabia  it appears that this latest  deal  is part of that the reason  deal  is in quotes in the above paragraph is that there is no deal  there is talk of a deal  but all we ve seen so far is a powerpoint slide  there is no legally binding contract  there is no timeline  although according to the powerpoint slide  it would take place over four years  as for the   billion investment  only a portion of that will be coming from softbank if it comes at all son said in a speech friday in new delhi that   billion of the money was put up by softbank    billion by the sovereign wealth fund of saudi arabia  and the remaining   billion by other investors  according to bloomberg the fund  therefore  plans to invest half of what it has raised in the us  for comparison  a study of all  venture capital funding in the world by ey found that roughly half of these investments were made in us based companies  so this allocation does not appear to be out of the ordinary source  business insiderperhaps the most important thing is that softbank  like trump  can t be trusted  they are already a large american employer and just last year  son announced his plan to cut thousands of jobs  however  even as early as last november  son was hinting at this latest plan  saying that he plans on increasing the company s stake in sprint featured image via sara d  davis getty images
