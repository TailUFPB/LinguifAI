senate democrats are defying republicans on the russian hacking scandal  and have gone ahead with an in your face move to address the problem  sens  ben cardin  md   dianne feinstein  ca   patrick leahy  vt   tom carper  de  and amy klobuchar  mn  just introduced a resolution to create an independent panel to investigate the allegations  which goes totally against mitch mcconnell s stated desire to simply have committees handle it this panel would have about  months to investigate and then present its findings to congress  that info would identify the people responsible for the hacks and include a recommendation for how to respond  sen  leahy said  we need an accounting   a serious  independent and bipartisan investigation of attempted russian interference in the american presidential election  this is larger than any one candidate or any one election  of course  mitch mcconnell thinks the senate intelligence committee should handle such an investigation  he even announced back in december that the intelligence committee would be looking into the russian hacks however  mcconnell also has no problem at all looking into how obama responded to the russian hacks  while he hasn t announced an independent panel on that front  the senate foreign relations committee will start looking into obama s new sanctions against russia and probably other responses sen  bob corker  r tn  said that they ll be looking at the broader issue of russian hacking  but here s a question  would they look into the presidential response if trump had announced new sanctions in response to russia s meddling chances are  they wouldn t  congressional republicans have already shown how they re working to ingratiate themselves to trump  while there s always a chance they d defy him on something like that  it seems more likely that they d champion trump as a true patriot who won t allow foreign powers to dictate what happens here if we can spend millions on independent panels investigating the giant nothing burgers of both benghazi and hillary s email server  surely we can have an independent panel look into something on which our entire intelligence community agrees happened  republicans will give democrats a hard time for this  but at least democrats are trying to do something real  all the gop response to the idea of an independent panel shows is that taking democrats like hillary down over non issues is far more important than doing something about russia meddling in our affairs featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
