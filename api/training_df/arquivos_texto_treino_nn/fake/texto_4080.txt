during all the fallout from the  access hollywood  tape that first revealed donald trump to be a sexual predator  and now  with all the women coming forward to accuse him of sexual assault  ivanka has stood staunchly by her father  it seems  though  that such support is hurting her own business  ivanka has a clothing line  which is sold in stores like tj maxx  but women who ve been forced to relive their own pain from sexual assault because of trump are boycotting ivanka s brand cosmopolitan spoke to lindsey ledford  a sexual assault survivor  about what seeing the trump name on a blouse did to her  my first thought was   grab them by the pussy  we can do anything we want  don t even ask   ledford told cosmopolitan com  the blouse was triggering traumatic flashbacks to physical abuse she d suffered in the past  and to times she d been grabbed or groped by men without her consent   none of them ever asked how i felt  what i was thinking  or what i wanted  they didn t wait   she wrote in a flurry of tweets at t j  maxx after fleeing the store   that is what  trump  means to me   she told me  complete disregard for women and their bodies   it doesn t matter if ivanka s name is in front of it  or donald s   there s a growing coalition of women who are working to boycott both ivanka s brand and the stores that carry it because it s too closely linked to donald trump  this plan came about because of shannon coulter  the ceo of a boutique marketing agency  just after the  access hollywood  tape came out  she tweeted not enough to not buy ivanka s collection  she campaigns for him  we should avoid stores that carry it   fashionnotfascism  ivankant  shannon coulter     shannoncoulter  october    herself has said that she s a daughter  not a surrogate  and it s been hard for women to condemn her for supporting her father because it s hard to be objective about family members  however  increasing numbers of women see ivanka as representative of a culture that demeans women to the point where it s okay to harass and assault them cosmopolitan also spoke to several other women  one said her revulsion at seeing ivanka s name inside a shoe was a  visceral response   because her attacker used almost the exact methods trump spoke of in his tape another woman threw out some pumps from ivanka s line  and refused to shop at stores that carried the brand  when it came to her wedding   my wedding is a day of love  i m not going to wear clothes that represent hate   she said those who are busy defending trump don t really seem to know or care what this revelation has done to women all over the country  perhaps worse  especially for women  is that ivanka has actually defended her father s vile treatment of women  he recognizes it was crude language  he was embarrassed that he said those things  and he apologized  that s not language consistent with any conversation i ve ever had with him  or any conversation i ve ever overheard  so it was a bit jarring to hear  i think he was sincere in his apology  it s hard for women who have been harassed and assaulted to listen to a fellow woman defend the very type of predator that hurt them  although ivanka s brand hasn t yet lost a ton of business  this boycott movement will likely grow as her father makes increasingly disgusting remarks about how he s going to get his revenge on the women accusing him of assault  that will be particularly true if she continues to openly defend him featured image by joe scarnici via getty images
