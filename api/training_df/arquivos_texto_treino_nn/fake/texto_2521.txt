while trump is busy claiming that the real news stories are all the leaks coming from the white house  various staffers are so afraid of being accused of leaking information to the press that they ve resorted to finding ways to hide their electronic communications  some of them are using a chat app called confide  which erases messages as soon as they re read some of these staffers may be behind some of the rogue twitter accounts  like roguepotusstaff and possibly altuspresssec tweet things that they overhear in the white house  but there has been a proliferation of news stories citing anonymous sources within the white house as well  as staffers refuse to be named for obvious reasons the funny thing is that use of confide may violate the presidential records act   certain staffers are required by law to use their official email addresses for communications  using a secret app like confide not only means they re not using their official accounts  but it also means there s no record at all the fact that staffers are willing to break the law to avoid trump s wrath is telling and they have reason to be afraid  sean spicer pointed at government employees as the source of the leaks  saying  when we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out  that undermines our national security  that s a real concern for this president  and rep  devin nunes  who chairs the house intelligence committee  is more interested in rooting out the sources of the leaks than he is about whether or not michael flynn broke any laws with his communications with russia it s true that the white house leaks are unprecedented  at least insofar as one of george w  bush s top officials is concerned  nobody knows where the leaks are coming from yet  but when you have to resort to secrecy just to avoid your boss  wrath and accusations even if you re not doing anything wrong there s a serious problem featured image by mario tama via getty images
