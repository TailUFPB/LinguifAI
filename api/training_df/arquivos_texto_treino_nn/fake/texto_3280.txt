several white supremacist hate groups have been able to exploit federal law and raised millions while disguising themselves as charities  according to a new report  espousing a hate message that advocates for a whites only america where minorities are removed from the country  these groups are not subtle about what they believe in  yet they were still able to pretend to be charitable groups in the eyes of the government the federal government has allowed four groups at the forefront of the white nationalist movement to register as charities and raise more than    million in tax deductible donations over the past decade  according to an associated press review already emboldened by donald trump s popularity  group leaders say they hope the president elect s victory helps them raise even more money and gives them a larger platform for spreading their ideology with benevolent sounding names such as the national policy institute and new century foundation  the tax exempt groups present themselves as educational organizations and use donors  money to pay for websites  books and conferences to further their ideology  the money also has personally compensated leaders of the four groups the irs actually has the power to exclude hate groups from being awarded a non profit designation  but some experts believe that recent complaints about the irs scrutinizing conservative scam groups that registered as non profits has scared off the agency  they also don t have the full resources necessary to police these sort of groups even worse  the incoming trump administration has coddled these groups  inviting them to cover his campaign and the  republican national convention  in all likelihood rooting out hate groups using the tax code to give tax breaks to racist funders is unlikely to be a major target for the trump team  it will fall to bureaucrats in the irs and outside investigations to expose these groups featured image via wikimedia commons
