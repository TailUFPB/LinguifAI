a whole lot of evangelical trump voters just discovered they got duped by picking mike pence as his vice president  donald trump sent a message to the lgbt community that their rights are in jeopardy of being rolled back in fact  one of the reasons why so many conservative  christians  tossed their alleged  morality  out the window to vote for him was precisely because they believed he would pass a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage or pack the courts with anti gay bigots to strike down all the rulings in favor of marriage equality but during his interview on  minutes with leslie stahl on sunday night  trump once again backed off another campaign promise  do you support marriage equality   stahl asked trump  it s irrelevant because it s already settled   trump replied   it s law  it was settled in the supreme court  i mean  it s done  when stahl pointed out that trump s supreme court nominees could reverse obergefell v  hodges  the case that made same sex marriage constitutional across the nation  trump made it clear that he believes it s settled  these cases have gone to the supreme court   trump said   they ve been settled  and i m fine with that  here s the video via twitter donald trump on marriage equality    minutes pic twitter com   blake   cultgaga  november    suggests that donald trump has no intention of attacking lgbt rights  however  the lgbt community should continue to watch trump like a hawk of course  this is going to especially disappoint mike pence  who has been an anti gay bigot for decades and signed laws in indiana designed to discriminate against gay people  it s also going to piss off all the evangelicals who voted for trump with the expectation that he would be a puppet for their hateful agenda hopefully  trump keeps his word  but he s already broken most of the promises he made to his supporters so it s hard to believe that he won t flip flop again  for now  we can only watch and enjoy as conservative bigots howl in rage featured image  indiana talks
