when kellogg pulled its advertising from the white nationalist website known as breitbart  they and their followers decided kellogg was evil for this and called for a boycott  breitbart s editor in chief  alexander marlow  even said  o blacklist breitbart news in order to placate left wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice  or it s standing up for the rights and dignity of the people breitbart regularly targets  but hey  they aren t exactly known for their ability to see reality  it seems  though  that their war against kellogg is now backfiring  vanguard   and aarp are leaving now  too and others pulling their ads from breitbart include nest labs  earthlink  modcloth and allstate  many companies  ads are placed automatically on websites through third parties  but those that are leaving have taken steps to blacklist breitbart in short  breitbart fucked up  they made two major mistakes  the first was when they decided to become the mouthpiece of white supremacy and nationalism  and the second was when they decided to attack one of their biggest advertisers advertisers do not like being associated with hate  it harms their brands advertisers also do not like seeing one of their partners attack other advertisers  it makes them wonder when it ll be their turn in the crosshairs however  breitbart seems to be too consumed with their hate of everything to the left of extreme white nationalism to understand this  they see kellogg s decision as  anti american   which is absolutely absurd since american businesses have always shifted their interests around for the purpose of protecting their brands but because the members of the so called  alt right   read  white nationalists  think they re the most put upon and persecuted demographic that ever existed in the whole entire history of everything  of course breitbart calls this  anti american   it s only nice and patriotic when they re doing this kind of thing lee wilkins  professor of communications at wayne state university  probably summed up breitbart s war on kellog the best by saying that breitbart was  behaving stupidly  there s a difference between being a conservative site and a white nationalist site  breitbart would do well to figure this out featured image by mike mozart  cc by   via flickr
