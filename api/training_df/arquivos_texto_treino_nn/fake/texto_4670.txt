it s one thing to have a choice to sit to during the national anthem  but it s something else entirely when one is forced to do so prior to a demolition derby event in west jordan  utah  police officer daniel argueta and his family were forced to sit during the star spangled banner because the truck carrying the american flag also carried a confederate flag  which stirrin  dirt racing owner jim simko blamed on  helpers  by claiming it was added shortly before the anthem but that s not true according to argueta  who says the confederate flag was positioned on the truck a full hour before the anthem took place  in other words  there was plenty of time to remove the flag but it wasn t as a result  the crowd was asked to stand and salute a racist flag of traitors alongside the stars and stripes and that s why argueta and his family chose to sit instead  you kind of get caught in  yes  you want to stand  you support the u s  flag   argueta told kstu tv   you support the troops  you support police officers  but what is the confederate flag doing there  for anybody that knows history and understands the negative impact of that flag and how it s been used historically  it s hard to stand up  the confederate flag has drawn much outrage in recent years  especially after white supremacist dylann roof murdered nine black parishioners at a church in south carolina  the state finally removed the confederate flag that had been flying for decades outside the statehouse  which had been raised in protest of civil rights simko tried to excuse the presence of the confederate flag by arguing that people should be free to fly it  it wasn t politically correct  i m sure  for some people  but there s some people who look at that flag and say this is the land of the free   simko said   it shouldn t have happened  but i can t  unfortunately  watch what everybody does at every minute  again  simko had  minutes to make sure it didn t happen and he did nothing  also  individuals have the freedom to fly the flag all they want on their private property  but this event forced people to salute a flag that had no business flying during our national anthem  it was humiliating   argueta said  it was demeaning  because with all the controversy going on with the flag recently and people sitting during the anthem  we had all intended to stand  but we couldn t  people probably looked around  probably wondering what we were doing  here s the video via kstu the reason why athletes such as colin kaepernick are sitting during the national anthem is because they are protesting police brutality and racial inequality  they have the right to make that choice and so far it has brought attention to the issues they want to highlight of course  if a pastor in alabama had his way  the argueta family and all of these athletes would be lined up against a wall and executed for not standing  thus demonstrating that conservatives don t really understand what freedom is at all featured image via deseret news
