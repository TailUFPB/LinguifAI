president barack obama appeared today at the bill   melinda gates foundation s  goalkeepers  event  an event aimed at effecting change on a global scale in the areas of world hunger  education access and quality  clean energy  healthcare  gender equality  clean water  climate action  and a host of other goals the foundation wants to help us work toward many speakers were on hand for the event  including president obama  canadian prime minister justin trudeau  will i am  malala  stephen fry  and more  all with stories of empowerment and positive change and possibility  but in america s current climate of fear and unease about what will happen with health care in this country  it was president obama s speech that was particularly emblematic of the struggle we face in determining the outcome of the american way of life when it comes to insurance  medical care  and ongoing health concerns this is in stark contrast with what we see in everyday life in america  where we seemingly can t even agree on whether or not white supremacists are bad  or if it s okay to run over protesters  we are engaged in a fight for our very lives  and at least legislatively speaking  obama knows how hard it looks from where we are from the video you re about to watch  hen i see those people trying to undo that hard won progress  for the  or  time  with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage  or roll back protections for older americans or people with pre existing conditions   the cancer survivor  the expecting mom  or the child with autism  or asthma  for whom coverage once again would be almost unattainable  it is aggravating and all of this being done without any demonstrable economic  or actuarial  or plain common sense rationale   it frustrates  and it s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents  president obama couldn t be more right  although he is diplomatic here and does not call out donald trump and the republicans by name  it is vital that we hold them to account  it is absolutely imperative that we make sure they cannot tear away at the fabric of our society and rip away at the moral cloth we ve woven in beginning the process of ensuring every american has access to health care watch the video here featured image via yana paskova getty images
