tuesday  trump s nominee to lead the doj s criminal division goes before the senate judiciary for confirmation  he will likely face questions about his time representing alfa bank  a major russian financial institution headed up by owners with ties with vladimir putin and the kremlin  brian benczkowski told congress less than a week ago about his ties to the bank  in advance of his testimony  as reported by the new york times apparently benczkowski was previously  unable  to disclose his former employer because of a confidentiality agreement he d signed  he has since gotten a waiver to do so  questions from the senators should likely include whether or not benczkowski intended to tell them about his russian contacts in the absence of such a waiver  anticipating this line of questioning  the letter he sent congress on july  indicated that he would now be able to discuss the fact and scope of the representation at the hearing  in part your staff has indicated that the committee may wish to question me at my hearing regarding the fact and scope of my work for alfa bank  as i am sure you understand  ethical considerations prohibit me from disclosing confidential legal advice or any other information protected by the attorney client privilege under any circumstances owners representing about   interest in the bank  mikhail fridman  petr aven and german khan  sued buzzfeed news in may over a dossier they published tying the bank to putin  trump  and the  election  although that suit is ongoing  a spokesman for buzzfeed called it a  shameless attempt to bully and intimidate  the news outlet  he cited the fact that  the allegations contained in the dossier were presented to successive presidents and remain under active investigation by intelligence agencies and congress   and the reports are still published hopefully  the committee takes into account the peripherals of benczkowski s contacts  rather than the simple fact of his employment  the fact that trump   who undoubtedly already knows everything the committee may find in their hearing and more   still tapped someone with extensive ties to russia despite the ongoing investigation speaks volumes about his brazen attitude toward both congress and the country itself featured image via eduardo munoz alvarez getty images
