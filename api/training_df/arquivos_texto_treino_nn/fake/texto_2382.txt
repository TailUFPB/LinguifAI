donald trump is so thin skinned that he would rather sit in the white house and pout instead of attending the white house correspondent s dinner it is a tradition for the president to attend the annual white house correspondent s dinner  it s a chance to spend time with reporters and journalists and enjoy the entertainment of a comedian  stephen colbert  craig ferguson  jon stewart  and jay leno are just a few of the big name comedians who have headlined the event  and presidents get the opportunity to let off some steam by delivering jokes  president obama was particularly skilled at self deprecating humor while also making jokes about his critics for example  president obama once seriously burned donald trump with a joke in  in reference to trump s birtherism  now  i know that he s taken some flak lately  but no one is happier  no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the donald   obama said   and that s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter   like  did we fake the moon landing  what really happened in roswell  and where are biggie and tupac  president obama then joked about trump s  leadership  on celebrity apprentice for firing gary busey after a cooking contest   these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night  well handled  sir  well handled   obama said  meanwhile  obama had just ordered the raid that killed osama bin laden  which makes his appearance at the dinner even more impressive but trump has decided to be a big baby and is now the first president to ever skip the event  ronald reagan did not attend in   but he had a good excuse since he had just been shot  but he still managed to deliver some remarks via phone i will not be attending the white house correspondents  association dinner this year  please wish everyone well and have a great evening   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    a discussion on cnn on saturday  new york times tv critic bill carter took trump to the woodshed for cowardly refusing to attend  republicans always criticize the media   carter said   this has reached a point where it s over the top  actually  any story that s critical of him now becomes  fake  indeed  trump has declared war on the media because they refuse to be his cheerleading squad  and i think the fact that he s bowing out of this dinner  it has a little bit of the quality of  you can t fire me  i quit   because a lot of people are dropping out of this dinner   carter continued and it s true  trump s attacks on the media have caused many news outlets to cancel parties and refuse to go to the dinner  now that trump isn t going  perhaps these outlets will now reverse their decision but carter wasn t done yet  carter said that trump knows he isn t going to get a good reception from the crowd at this event  particularly in light of his claim that the media is the  enemy of the american people  in other words  trump is literally running away because he doesn t want to be criticized  he likes to have paid applauders   he quipped   the whole thing would have been fraught for him  and i know there s been a lot of criticism of democrats for being  snowflakes   but it s sort of snowflake y to me  to back out of this  here s the video via youtube donald trump knows that he won t be a very welcome guest at the dinner event  but that doesn t mean he should tuck his tail between his legs and run away  if ever there was a chance for a mea culpa with the media  this is it  trump could apologize to the media for his unfair and un american attacks on them and try to build a better relationship with them  but he won t because he is a petulant child who would rather throw a temper tantrum instead of doing something that makes him look like a grown up featured image via mark wilson getty images
