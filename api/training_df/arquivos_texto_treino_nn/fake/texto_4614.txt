on thursday  donald trump appeared on the dr  oz show for what was basically a scripted series of softball questions  he was armed with a doctor s report from his already suspect doctor  dr  harold bernstein  who months ago made the ridiculous assertion that trump would be the  healthiest individual ever elected  this time  the report was a bit more detailed  but who knows if it s accurate  it showed his cholesterol and blood pressure as normal  he also had high hormone levels  i m sure trump wanted that included  and for the most part  things are good  according to trump s doctor  but he is overweight  in other words  it was a pretty boring report  except for one tiny little tidbit that was barely mentioned by any media sources  donald trump is nuts now  i m not a psychologist and i ve never met the man  so that s why i ve used the very non clinical word of  nuts   but trust me when i say he s howard hughes nuts  he s kim jon un nuts  he  like so many dictator wannabes  is paranoid as f ck trump loves fast food and ironically despises finger food  mcdonald s is his favorite  he loves fast food because  at least you know  what s in it  really  what exactly is in a mcdonald s hamburger per an audience member at dr  oz taping with trump  he said he likes fast food because  at least you know what they are putting in it   jesse rodriguez   jesserodriguez  september    also thinks that his gesticulating at campaign events counts as exercise back to the fast food  he might  know what s in it   but he s really afraid of what people might put in it if they know it s for him trump admitted to oz that he does eat a fair amount of fast food when he s on the road campaigning  and that the person who picks it up is told not to tell the restaurant it is for him because he worries the food may be tampered with source  whiohitler also felt his food would be tampered with  in fact  that seems to be a common theme among dictators  hitler hired a team of  food tasters  if  after  minutes  the tasters were still alive  hitler would eat  trump didn t mention whether he has his staff taste his food but it s not even unheard of among recent u s  presidents  it s reported that ronald reagan and george w  bush had food tasters  fox also tried to make it seem as if obama does  while there s no evidence  sarah palin once suggested that trump get a food taster  at least we think she did  maybe that s chris christie s job maybe trump isn t paranoid as much as being realistic  he s managed to insult every single demographic in the united states  except for his base of middle aged  poorly educated white men  there are probably millions of restaurant employees who would love to add just a little something to trump s food  fortunately for him  most just do their jobs featured image via donkeyhotey flickr
