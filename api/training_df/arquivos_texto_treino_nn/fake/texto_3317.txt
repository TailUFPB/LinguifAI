oh  alabama  in some ways  you ve replaced arizona  texas and florida for craziest state in the nation  and your governor just proved it  trump has nominated alabama sen  jeff sessions for attorney general  which means alabama has to replace him in the senate  who are they considering  there are several candidates  but one of them really shouldn t be under any consideration at all  suspended chief justice roy moore roy moore is the state supreme court justice who ordered all his probate judges to violate a federal court order to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples  for that  he was put on trial and suspended because he was in direct violation of a federal court order  along with interfering with the legal process he also proved that he s not willing to obey the law when it conflicts with his own warped morals  despite the fact that this is not a christian nation  moore insists on practicing his faith from the bench and forcing the rest of the state to break the law to obey his morals moore and his attorney  mat staver of the liberty counsel  went through all sorts of bizarre gyrations in an attempt to clear moore s name and keep him on the bench  that included saying his order was merely a status report of sorts  he was just responding to questions from his  probate judges  according to his version of events staver also accused the court system of being on a  witch hunt  to eliminate a controversial figure and this is the type of person that governor robert bentley thinks would make a good interim senator to replace sessions until a special election can be held  moore would be at least as bad as ted cruz  but probably worse  maybe even much worse  moore has zero business ever holding any public office again  and bentley must be on something to think otherwise featured image by erik s  lesser via getty images
