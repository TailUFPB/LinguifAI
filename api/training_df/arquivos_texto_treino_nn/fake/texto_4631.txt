an african american pastor in flint  michigan was able to get donald trump to do what nobody else has for the last year  shut up it happened when trump  after touring a water treatment facility in the lead afflicted city  spoke at a church  as part of his speech  instead of addressing the water crisis that has many in the area worried about their children s health  the republican nominee started in on a political attack against hillary clinton pastor faith green timmons then stepped in  and stopped the republican in his tracks timmons told trump   i invited you here to thank us   not to give a political speech   apparently completely chastened  trump stopped and instead of his usual braggadocio he reverted to an almost childlike tone he told timmons   no  i never  never would  never would  never would   he then quickly ended his speech  saying a few more words and promising to bring jobs back to the city the incident reflects the latest gaffe for trump with black voters  for a few weeks his campaign has claimed that he is conducting  outreach  but in reality  trump has instead repeatedly told blacks that they live in poverty  stuck in inner city hellholes filled with gun violence  he has also described the living situations of blacks in america as so horrible  they can t do  any worse  this has prompted considerable backlash among minority voters and others  leading to extremely negative polling for trump with that voting bloc  even as he has improved among some white voters trump has said that this supposed  reaching out  to black voters will result in gains for his campaign  but the evidence instead shows that his ham handed activities are more likely to continue the republican trend of poor performance in this demographic  this incident in flint is unlikely to help that trajectory featured image via screen capture
