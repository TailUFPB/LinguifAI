this is what legendary newsman dan rather thinks about trumpcare  and it s an epic ass kicking on monday  house republicans officially passed a bill they dubiously refer to as the  american healthcare act  except that is neither american nor is it healthcare instead  this bill repeals the affordable care act  which strips tens of millions of americans of their health insurance coverage while raising the cost of care significantly  the bill does nothing to cover more people and does not improve healthcare one iota  yet trump has praised this piece of shit bill as  wonderful  dan rather disagrees and wrote a scathing post on facebook calling out republicans and trump for screwing over the american people  for seven years we ve been hearing from republicans about how horrible obamacare was  and this was the best they could come up with   rather wrote   a rush job that doesn t seem to have any new ideas or fix the core problems  it seems to prove the point that this was always about rhetoric and not about actually trying to make health insurance either cover more people or lower costs  indeed  this has always been about tearing down the legacy of america s first black president  the affordable care act was not perfect but did slow down the rising costs of healthcare while making the uninsured rate drop to all time lows rather then slammed donald trump for breaking every promise he made on the campaign trail the ball is firmly in the court of the gop  they control the government  and president trump made promises on the campaign trail about lower premiums  keeping your doctor  everyone staying insured  etc  basically a version of healthcare that would be better told by hans christian andersen   a fairy tale  and everyone with any sense on this issue knew it legislation isn t a campaign speech  it actually has to be made up of words that lead to law  and those words have to actually tell you something about who will win and who will lose  who will be covered and how much it might cost  and now that we have a gop plan  it is getting picked apart by politicians and interest groups on all sides  it is starting to look about as popular as ants at a picnic in conclusion  rather shamed paul ryan and republicans for putting the hatred and racism of their rabid base over the health and lives of the millions of people who rely on the affordable care act so here we stand  and president trump is swinging the full weight of his administration behind the ryan plan  maybe that will be enough to arm twist skeptical republicans  or maybe this effort will fall apart in spectacular failure  mr  trump promised to replace and repeal obamacare on day one  but the affordable care act  yes to some out there  that is the same as obamacare  is still the law of the land  and who knows how long that may last  it likely will be dramatic political theater  it s just a horrible shame that the stakes being toyed with are millions of americans and their health insurance featured image via matthew eisman getty images
