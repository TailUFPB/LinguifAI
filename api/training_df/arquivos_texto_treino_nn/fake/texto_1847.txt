paul ryan is all over twitter chanting  repeal and replace   and proclaiming the aca a disaster  trump has said repeatedly that it s going to explode  and it ll be on the democrats  heads when it does   they re all spewing dire warnings about insurers leaving the marketplace in   and yet  they still don t have a plan  which is a worse failure than anything since they had seven years to do it  and unfortunately for them  there s a new analysis out that points to something besides their dire predictions standard   poor s took a look at the performance of many blue cross blue shield plans across nearly  states  and found that the insurers under blue cross blue shield actually reduced their losses in   will probably break even this year  and will start seeing a profit from the marketplace in  s p bluntly gives the lie to the gop s cries of  death spirals  with this after years in which many insurers lost money  then lost even more in    we are seeing the first signs in  that this market could be manageable for most health insurers   the standard   poor s analysts said  the  market is not in a  death spiral  a majority of americans want congress to fix the aca  not  repeal and replace  it anymore  their sorry attempt at passing a healthcare bill last month further damaged their already destroyed credibility on the issue  and nearly  percent of americans want to keep the parts of the aca that are working  and fix the parts that aren t working so well also  according to a kaiser family foundation report   percent of americans say that republicans are responsible for the failure of their farce of a healthcare plan  and another  percent say trump is responsible  only  percent of those surveyed blame democrats for the bill s failure it s true that insurers are threatening to pull out of the aca s marketplace  which will leave some places with only one carrier or without any at all in the marketplace  that s something that could have been changed or prevented if the gop had actually managed to get something together over the last seven years depending on what happens this year  though  that could change  if it does  then republicans will be out of excuses featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
