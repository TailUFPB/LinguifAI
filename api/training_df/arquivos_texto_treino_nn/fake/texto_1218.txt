lawyers  especially on twitter  like giving their own legal opinions on things to their followers  some of them will try and explain legal matters happening in the nation s capital  and they don t always agree  but they always have insight for us laypeople  seth abramson  one such lawyer  has been tweeting threads explaining some of what s happening  and he just posted one that s pretty damning for the gop the gop is calling comey s testimony a win for trump  the fact that they would be so obviously false is just amazing  and not in an  i didn t expect this   way  abramson calls them out on that by rehashing comey s testimony in a series of  tweets  two particular tweets allude to the gop s  and trump s  insistence that comey proved trump was not under investigation today    the president of the united states is under criminal investigation for felony obstruction of justice by special counsel bill mueller   seth abramson   sethabramson  june      comey told trump he wasn t under  counter intelligence  investigation but knew that that assessment could well change and still might   seth abramson   sethabramson  june    testified that he wouldn t tell the world that he told trump he was not personally under investigation because he didn t want to create  a duty to correct  the record later  if he publicly stated that trump wasn t under investigation  and that changed  he d have to correct the record  he went down that road with hillary clinton s email investigation  he knew where it led  he didn t want to further damage the fbi s credibility by going down that road again none of that changes the fact that special prosecutor mueller is investigating trump for obstruction of justice   a probe that includes comey s contemporaneous memos then there s this  which the gop hasn t yet addressed and seems to have completely forgotten    president trump never once talked with comey about ways to stop russian cyberattacks nor expressed any concern on that score to the fbi   seth abramson   sethabramson  june      of the thousands of open fbi investigations  the only one trump ever asked his fbi director about was an investigation of his campaign   seth abramson   sethabramson  june    far as comey s testimony goes  trump was only concerned about himself  as comey put it   e re talking about a foreign government using technical intrusion and lots of other methods tried to shape the way we think  we vote  we act  and people need to recognize that  they re coming after america  someone needs to ask why trump doesn t find that concerning abramson brings up a major  solid point about comey s behavior during his testimony  while he answered some questions with  i don t know   and   i m not sure   he also had a very strong recollection of the meeting in the oval office that prompted him to ask jeff sessions to not leave him alone with trump again    comey s recollection of these events is so ironclad he knew who sat where  which doors he used so much detail he cannot be impeached   seth abramson   sethabramson  june    s final take on comey s testimony today is that we got far more damaging information today than we did yesterday  despite more fireworks being launched during yesterday s hearing  you can read the entire thread here featured image via doug mills  pool getty images
