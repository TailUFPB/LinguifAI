fox host bret baier found himself forced to retract a statement earlier today that claimed an indictment against hillary clinton was very likely because  well  he d pretty much lied and promptly got caught  but the fbi has been a sieve for information about hillary lately  which is where baier supposedly got some of his information  and it s time to ask why one fbi agent  who spoke to the guardian on the condition of anonymity  might have part of the answer  in fact  he just destroyed the bureau s reputation with his truth bomb about what s actually happening  according to this agent  the fbi is basically  trumplandia   in that the agency isn t anything like objective about its investigations into hillary  the currently serving fbi agent said clinton is  the antichrist personified to a large swath of fbi personnel   and that  the reason why they re leaking is they re pro trump   apparently  their attitudes only got worse when director james comey decided not to recommend indicting hillary earlier this year  a lot of trumpkins all over the country were angry about that  most likely because she s a woman  and a clear and present threat to their chosen candidate  the witch hunts have very little to do with actual evidence that she s a criminal but it s not just trumpkins that can t stand her   whether they re trumpkins or not  many in the fbi just have a very unfavorable view of hillary  that  too  raises serious questions about the agency s integrity right now  there are lots of people who don t think trump is qualified  but also believe clinton is corrupt  what you hear a lot is that it s a bad choice  between an incompetent and a corrupt politician  the bureau has come under fire for its handling of these investigations  along with comey s decision to send a letter to congress about newly discovered emails just  days before the election  that alone was enough to give the impression that they re not objective  especially since comey has refused to respond to that criticism the daily beast also picked up on a story alleging that there are connections between rudy giuliani  who s got his head buried deep inside trump s ass  and the new york city fbi office  that office pressed headquarters to continue looking into the matter of hillary s emails after comey declared the investigation effectively closed  agents are pissed at comey because they believe the failure to recommend indictment shook people s faith in the bureau so the leaks from the bureau continue  and it s pretty clear now that the fbi is  in fact  on a witch hunt against hillary rather than conducting legitimate investigations into legitimate problems  if anything is calling the fbi s integrity into question  it s this  rather than comey s decision not to indict back in july image of hillary clinton by by justin sullivan  image of james comey by alex wong  via getty images
