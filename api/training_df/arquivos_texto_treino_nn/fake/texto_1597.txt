if you didn t know that housing and urban development secretary ben carson was once a neurosurgeon  you would never believe he had any hint of intelligence just from the idiotic things he says today  ben carson was quoted in a new york times interview painting an extremely solemn picture of what public housing will look like under the trump administration  as carson has said several ridiculous things during his own failed presidential campaign and while he was helping with trump s campaign  this should hardly be surprising   but it will still infuriate you carson defended disabled and elderly people who might need public housing  and said we can t expect to do a great deal to take care of themselves   but when it came to others who did not fall into those two categories but still needed public housing  carson had something else to say  he said  there is another group of people who are able bodied individuals  and i think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them  the times reported compassion  mr  carson explained in an interview  means not giving people  a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say   i ll just stay here  they will take care of me  it s safe to say that most of us have been taught a very different meaning of the word  compassion   and carson s definition clearly does not fit  carson has been traveling all over the united states to get a scope of public housing in places like detroit and miami  while he was in ohio  carson visited a facility for drug abusers and reportedly said  we are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves  carson s attitude toward public housing is disgraceful  and abc s sunny hostin was right to slam him immediately featured image via joe raedle   getty images
