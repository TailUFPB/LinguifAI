while it seems like donald trump hasn t worked a single full day since he stepped foot in the white house  the former reality television star apparently feels differently currently  trump is  busy  enjoying his  day vacation  despite the fact that he s already spent approximately   of his presidency on the golf course  and much more time glued to cable news and his twitter account  if there s any potus that doesn t deserve to take time off  it s certainly   trump has gotten a lot of backlash over taking time off  especially considering how much trump criticized former president barack obama for taking a little bit of time off  it s quite hilarious  because obama worked his a   off for america  trump hasn t done a damn thing besides create chaos and humiliate the country  and he s already taken three times as much time off than obama  here s a quick refresher of how trump has trashed obama over the years  now that trump is being outed for being the laziest potus we ve ever had  it s no wonder he threw an absolute fit today in response to the criticism  this evening  trump took a break from his golf outing at new jersey s bedminster golf resort to whine about how he s working hard and not on vacation  despite the fact that this is totally a vacation seriously pathetic  trump even left  work early to begin his golfing holiday today  the hypocrisy that follows everything trump does is just mind blowing  he truly lives in his own world  far removed from reality and any sort of logical thought trump does not deserve to be taking a holiday right now  he is ignoring america s pressing issues and the american people while creating disturbance everywhere he goes  deep down  he knows he doesn t deserve it   or else he wouldn t be so damn defensive featured image via ian macnicol    getty images
