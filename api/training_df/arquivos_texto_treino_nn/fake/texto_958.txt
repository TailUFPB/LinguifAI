ever since the historic ruling that made same sex marriage legal in all  states in june   opponents cried that it s a war against them  but  is it really  it seems like it s a war against those in a same sex marriage  even by those in the courthouse  rather than live and let live  people enjoy making others miserable what should be the defenders and upholders of justice have let same sex spouses down in texas when the texas supreme court ruled that the constitution does not clearly require states to extend spousal benefits to same sex couples  this decision came friday  the ruling was unanimous  making it clear that they do not believe in justice or marriage equality the texas supreme court interpreted the ruling of obergefell v  hodges narrowly  questioning whether it compels states to treat same sex couples equally to opposite sex couples in any context outside of marriage licensing  i guess we shouldn t expect anything better from texas friday s ruling of pidgeon v  turner revolves around spousal benefits for government workers  texas law prohibits same sex couples from receiving such benefits  how that is even possible is beyond me slate reports that according to the court  obergefell  did not address and resolve  the  specific issue  of state spousal benefits  therefore  the state appeals court erred in ordering the trial court to resolve the case  consistent with obergefell and de leon   instead  the texas supreme court insisted  the trial court must settle the issue itself keeping in mind that obergefell  did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons  i am flabbergasted  how can judges  meant to serve justice  deny justice  how can they interpret rulings and laws this way  they re bending the ruling to their will because on a personal level they probably don t like same sex marriage my heart goes out to all the same sex spouses that are not receiving fair and equal spousal benefits featured image via robert daemmrich photography inc corbis getty images
