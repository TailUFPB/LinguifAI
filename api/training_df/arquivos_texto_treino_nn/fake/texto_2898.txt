this morning  kellyanne conway attempted to spin white house press secretary sean spicer s blatant lies about trump s inauguration numbers into simply an alternate version of the truth  this isn t the first time she s said something like this  and so it s getting more than a little ridiculous  fortunately  chuck todd nailed her to the wall for it  but he wasn t the only one  merriam webster decided to nail her for it too  with a short  concise tweet  a fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality  https   t co   merriam webster   merriamwebster  january    like having the dictionary troll you when you try to redefine words in front of the whole damn world merriam webster didn t stop with just a single tweet  though  that link goes to an entire article blasting conway for pretending the word  fact  doesn t mean what we think it means  in addition to the modern definition  which is their tweet  they gave three obsolete definitions which further puts conway to shame  there are three obsolete senses of fact in english  two of these senses are no longer used fact meaning  a wrong or unlawful deed  is rare  but is still used in the phrase  after the fact  merriam webster also reported  in that story  that lookups for the word  fact  spiked after conway spewed her nonsense all over chuck todd  fact  is their   lookup today  and  feminism  is their   lookup  their   lookup  though   fascism   that s been one of their trending lookups for a few months now  which says something about how people on both sides view trump you know you ve screwed up big time with a word when you ve got the dictionary coming after you for it featured image by yana paskova via getty images
