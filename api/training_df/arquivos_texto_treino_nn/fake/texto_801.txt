sen  john mccain  r az   fresh off a brain cancer diagnosis that he is statistically unlikely to beat  is apparently all out of f cks to give  today  he tweeted an article in the opinion section of the washington post  calling it a  must read   the article in question   trump s breathtaking surrender to russia  and the op ed holds absolutely nothing back  here are a couple of my favorite excerpts from the piece but once again  president trump   after extended personal contact with vladimir putin and the complete surrender to russian interests in syria   acts precisely as though he has been bought and sold by a strategic rival  the ignoble cutoff of aid to american proxies means that  putin won in syria   as an administration official was quoted by the post  concessions without reciprocation  made against the better judgment of foreign policy advisers  smack more of payoff than outreach  if this is what trump s version of  winning  looks like  what might further victory entail  the re  creation of the warsaw pact  the reversion of alaska to russian control  there is nothing normal about an american president s subservience to russia s interests and worldview  it is not the result of some bold  secret  nixonian foreign policy stratagem   the most laughable possible explanation  does it come from trump s bad case of authoritarianism envy  a fundamental sympathy with european right wing  anti democratic populism  an exposure to pressure from his checkered financial history  there are no benign explanations  and the worst ones seem the most plausible  the problem is the damage to u s  interests done in the meantime  it now seems that the russians   by meddling in a presidential election and by playing down such aggression   have achieved an intelligence coup beyond the dreams of the soviet era  the result is an america strategically and morally disarmed the fact that john mccain is posting such a strongly worded article about trump s surrender to russia is extremely telling  and begs the question  behind closed doors  how many other republicans feel this way  in public  it s obvious that republicans feel they must present a united front against the democratic party and forces of the left  however  despite recent silence from  nevertrump conservatives  it wasn t even a year ago that leadership figures such as paul ryan were dead set against him  given the fact they are spineless  how much pressure will it take to get them to turn against him if donald trump s numbers keep dropping  primarily among republicans  i think you ll see it happen  and if that s the case  it might not take until  to bring him down here s senator mccain s tweet must read  mjgerson  washingtonpost   trump s breathtaking surrender to  russia  https   t co   john mccain   senjohnmccain  july    image via win mcnamee getty images
