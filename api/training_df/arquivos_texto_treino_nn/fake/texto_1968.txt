by now  everyone is aware of the appallingly abusive way in which white house press secretary sean spicer treated american urban radio correspondent april ryan during tuesday s white house press briefing  all ryan was doing was  well  her job  and asking about the cloud of russia investigations hanging over the embattled trump administration  this caused sean spicer to completely lose it  and launch into condescending  sexist  and racist attacks on ryan after the press availability was over  ryan spoke with msnbc s katy tur about her experience  addressing the accusation from sean spicer that she was pushing an agenda rather than just reporting the facts  ryan told tur  i don t have an agenda  we ve never seen anything like this before and my question was simple  how do you change the perception problem  and it went off into this russian dressing  no shaking my head or whatever  you cannot ignore  as a reporter  there are issues on capitol hill  you have investigations going  you have the head of the intel committee coming here to the white house briefing people  the president himself  i understand what sean is doing  trying to make this administration look better than what it does right now  and unfortunately  i was roadkill today  no matter what sean spicer s job is  he had not right to treat april ryan that way  she was just doing her job  if he can t handle tough questions  he should find another line of work  to flat out deny all of those investigations  and to accuse the press of being at fault for the fact that the criminal activity that is clearly taking place inside the trump white house is a huge story is truly beyond the pale  until they come clean about the russia business  this will continue to be a story  the white house press corp would derelict in their duties if they didn t continue to press spicer on this good on you for being a superb member of the fourth estate  ms  ryan  you handled spicer s abuse with grace and dignity  believe me  he s the one who comes out looking worse for wear on this one watch the video below  via real clear politics featured image via video screen capture
