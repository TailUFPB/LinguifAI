donald trump hasn t even been sworn in yet and he s already beating richard nixon when it comes to being a liar forty four years have passed since the watergate scandal dominated the news  carl bernstein was one of the washington post reporters who broke the scandal wide open throughout his presidency  richard nixon repeatedly lied and misled people  and when watergate happened  he tried to cover it up by any means necessary  in the end  nixon was forced to resign because he was going to be impeached  he remains the only president who has ever resigned the office and the watergate scandal became the scandal by which other political scandals are judged well  donald trump has spent the last few days defending russia and desperately trying to cover up the fact that russia hacked into our election to help trump win  he doesn t believe the cia assessment concluding that russia interfered and claimed on fox news sunday that democrats are pushing a lie to taint his  great victory  in short  trump threw american intelligence agencies under the bus to defend putin and accused democrats of making up a scandal  this is something that richard nixon would do  but unlike trump  nixon didn t deny facts at every turn  nor did he lie every time he spoke trump does exactly that on twitter every day  launching attacks and smear campaigns against anyone who criticizes him or runs a story he doesn t like  trump also exaggerates his supposed accomplishments like the carrier deal  which is nothing more than a windfall for carrier at taxpayer expense while jobs are slashed anyway carl bernstein knows this first hand  which is why he declared trump a bigger liar than nixon during an appearance on cnn  trump lives and thrives in a fact free environment   bernstein said   no president  including richard nixon  has been so ignorant of fact and disdains fact in the way that this president elect does  and it has something to do with the growing sense of authoritarianism that he and his presidency are projecting and the danger of it is obvious and he s trying to make the conduct of the press the issue  not his own conduct  bernstein used trump s carrier deal as an example of his lies and trump s attack against a steelworkers union leader as an example of trump denying facts and lashing out at anyone who dares to call him out  he doesn t go to a fact based argument  he goes to an emotion base argument   bernstein pointed out   what we have seen throughout the campaign is pathological disdain for the truth  jeffrey lord  of course  whined about bernstein s analysis  but berstein stood by what he said and doubled down  we now have a president elect who  in terms of truthfulness richard nixon was nothing  in terms of lying  compared to what we have seen from donald trump  here s the video via youtube donald trump is more unfit to be president than richard nixon  we could very well be looking at the most scandal ridden administration in american history and it hasn t even taken over yet  at this rate  trump might as well resign now before he becomes the first president to lose an impeachment trial featured image  screenshot
