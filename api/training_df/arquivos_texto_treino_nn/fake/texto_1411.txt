about  trump scandals ago  rep  devin nunes  r ca  recused himself from the house russian investigation for feeding information to donald trump  a report from cnn  though  shows that he s still receiving intelligence as you may recall  just a few weeks ago  nunes came under fire for visiting the white house grounds after learning that donald trump may have been swept up in surveillance before he took office  nunes denies that he delivered the intel to trump but nonetheless  he recused himself from the investigation   at least he appeared  until now  to have recused himself nunes  a california republican  took a trip to the cia this week to review russia intelligence  according to house intelligence committee sources  as word of nunes trip trickled out among lawmakers this week  it angered democrats who thought that they had moved past the chaos spurred by nunes  coordination with the white house rep  mike quigley  an illinois democrat on the house intelligence committee  shrugged when asked if he was concerned that nunes had not completely removed himself from the house russia investigation  he recused himself  so he can set those limits   quigley said a senior house republican aide noted that nunes is still the chairman of the house intelligence committee and has duties  which still require him to review classified intelligence  the aide added that house speaker paul ryan is not setting the terms of nunes  recusal from the leadership of the investigation source  cnnrecusal  it appears  is all relative  at least if you re a trump loving republican  attorney general jeff sessions recused himself from the russia investigation  but still played a role in the firing of fbi director james comey democrats in both the house and the senate are taking the investigation of trump and his russian ties very seriously  but republicans  as nunes and sessions are proving  are doing everything in their power to obstruct the investigation  while it might be legal for nunes to have the intel  it s certainly against the spirit of his recusal  if house leadership had a spine  they d be taking him off the committee altogether featured image via drew angerer getty images
