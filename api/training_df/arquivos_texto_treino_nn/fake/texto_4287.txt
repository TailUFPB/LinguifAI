as we all know  trump told access hollywood host billy bush in  that he made unwanted advances on a married woman and bragged that he walks up to beautiful women and just starts kissing them and  grab them by the p ssy  seriously  it s all on tape  had the tape been turned over to police they might have opened a sexual assault investigation on sunday morning  cnn anchor john king said that trump should be in jail instead of being the republican nominee for president king began by playing part of the clip of trump talking about how he pursued a married woman by taking her furniture shopping  and then he talks about  moving on that b tch  i said what you re about to see was some graphic language   king said   that s one of the tamest parts  and the point  if you go on in this tape  that s he s talking about making unwanted advances on a married woman  he also talks about conduct that is a crime  if he did it  people go to jail for the things that he was talking about doing  groping women  that was the dam opening  indeed  it is a crime and that why many republicans are desperately trying to distance themselves from trump the outrage was so bad that trump was forced to apologize for the remarks  but king noted that it took trump s aides hours to get him to actually do it  king proceeded to slam trump for it and pointed out that what trump said is not mere locker room talk  it s a confession to committing crimes  in his video released saturday night  after it took his aides hours to convince him this was a big deal  that s important here too  he doesn t say in the video that i never did this  he never says he never did this  i m going to say it one more time  he s bragging about things that people go to jail for  i ve been to a lot of locker rooms  men say stupid things in locker rooms  men say inappropriate things in locker rooms  men do not talk about committing crimes in locker rooms or  if anybody brings it up  the grown up on the team pushes that guy against the locker and tells him to shut up  here s the video via vidme in other words  trump should have been investigated by law enforcement and should have been arrested  tried  sentenced to serve time in jail  and required to register as a sex offender  he certainly should never have been elevated to the leadership of a major political party and been allowed to get this close to becoming the most powerful person in the world  republicans own this and they need to pay a price for it in november featured image via screenshot
