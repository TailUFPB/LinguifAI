kellyanne conway got herself into a world of sh t when she decided to violate ethics rules on behalf of ivanka trump s business  because now ivanka is pissed on thursday  conway whined about nordstrom dropping ivanka s product line due to lack of sales and then she desperately begged fox news viewers to open their wallets  they are using the most prominent woman in donald trump s life   conway began   using her  who has been a champion for empowerment of women in the workplace  to get to him  i think she s gone from  stores to a thousand stores  or a thousand places where you can buy  you can buy her goods online  go buy ivanka s stuff is what i would tell you  i hate shopping  i m going to go get some myself today  this is just a wonderful line  i own some of it  i fully   i m going to give a free commercial here  go buy it today  everybody  you can find it online  and by promoting ivanka s business  conway violated federal code     which specifically states an employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain  for the endorsement of any product  service or enterprise  or for the private gain of friends  relatives  or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity  including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member  an employee shall not use or permit the use of his government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product  service or enterprise ethics complaints have bombarded trump s administration ever since and ivanka s business is now embroiled in a political scandal  which won t help sales despite apologizing to donald trump and apparently being forgiven  kellyanne conway still had to face ivanka and the confrontation was reportedly not pretty according to politico  a source close to trump said that his daughter scolded conway for dragging her brand into an ethics mess and told her not to mention it again on tv  this was a continuation of a conversation that ivanka trump had with her father weeks earlier about leaving her business out of the politics  that conway wasn t aware of  so ivanka took kellyanne conway to the woodshed for hurting her company  and that s just another example of the chaos and infighting that has been occurring inside the white house since trump took office  one wonders how long it will be before kellyanne conway gets fired  because the way she has repeatedly embarrassed herself on television in defense of trump  that day should be soon  especially if she keeps angering ivanka featured image via yana paskova getty images
