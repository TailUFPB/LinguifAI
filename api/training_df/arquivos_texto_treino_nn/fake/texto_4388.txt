republican presidential nominee donald trump wants to pretend that he s for the working man  that he understands their struggles  the truth is  though  that trump is a rich  spoiled brat who has never known poverty or what it is like to worry where his next meal or rent check was coming from  that s the reality for many average americans  and he doesn t have a clue about it  one person who understands this is cleveland cavaliers basketball great lebron james james wrote a passionate op ed in business insider  in which he laid out the reasons he is endorsing and supporting democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  james writes  as a kid  i didn t have much money  it was just my mom and me  and things were rough at times  but i had basketball  that gave me a family  a community  and an education  that s more than a lot of children in akron can say if basketball has taught me anything  it s that no one achieves greatness alone  and it takes everyone working together to create real change when i look at this year s presidential race  it s clear which candidate believes the same thing  only one person running truly understands the struggles of an akron child born into poverty  and when i think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government  the choice is clear that candidate is hillary clinton  this is especially significant because ohio is a state where james is pretty much worshipped  and it is also a state that is seen as essential for winning the presidency  this is an opinion that holds a lot of weight there lebron james embodies the american dream  as does hillary clinton  hillary was raised by a mother who began working at the age of  because she was abandoned by her parents and had to leave the home of grandparents who never wanted her   and look at all hillary became  lebron james was a poor kid raised by a single mom who became one of the most revered sports stars in the country  in contrast  donald trump never worked for anything he has  he inherited it  he s really good at being a spoiled  entitled rich kid who has never cared about anything but himself and his brand  do we really want that as president  i certainly don t thanks  lebron   imwithher  too featured image via david liam kyle nbae via getty images
