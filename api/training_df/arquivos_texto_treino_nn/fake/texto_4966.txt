donald trump campaign senior advisor jack kingston appeared on cnn friday to discuss trump s efforts to reach out to voters of color  during the segment  kingston said that  maybe it would have been nice if he  went and had a backdrop with a burning car  while speaking at a campaign event in wisconsin in order to appeal to black voters  as a reminder  you are not reading the onion  those are the real words that kingston said while on television for the entire world to hear during the segment  cnn host brianna keiler attempted to explain to kingston that it isn t a good idea to try and reach out to voters of color by speaking to a nearly entirely white community  she also questioned the decision to reach out to a voting bloc that overwhelmingly supports the democratic challenger  hillary clinton  as per usual when talking to a trump fan  kingston says that trump is doing far better with a group than polls show here s a transcript of the conversation keilar  he s polling right now at  percent with african american voters  is that the right way to attract a voting block that obviously favors hillary clinton much more than him kingston  well first of all  our internal poll show us doing better than  percent  but the reality is he s going there and he s taking it to them  he s giving them a proposal  he s saying   you know what  i m interested  i went to milwaukee  i m here tonight  i want to talk to you   and one of the things he actually said last night in north carolina that kind of went uncovered  but he says  i don t want to preside over another generation of children who are left out of the american dream  keilar  i have to stop you because you said he s going there  he s not  he s in diamondale  which is  percent white  when he was in milwaukee the other day  it was part of milwaukee that wasn t dealing   i mean he  it s  kingston  well yeah  but brianna he went  keilar  it s almost completely white kingston  i mean  maybe it would have been nice if he went and had a backdrop with a burning car  but the reality is  keilar  no no no no no  i m not talking about a burning car  i m talking about meeting with black voters kingston  well  he met with david clarke  who as you know is the african american sheriff of milwaukee  and he s engaged with him  and his rallies are open to the public  last night in north carolina  we saw a lot of african americans  i wasn t sure about the crowd content tonight  but the reality is  keilar  it s white  we checked wow  it s hard to imagine trump s polling numbers being able to go down from a measly   from black voters  however  they might plummet to zero if they keep up with this pathetic voter outreach effort you can watch the segment below  via media matters featured image from video screenshot
