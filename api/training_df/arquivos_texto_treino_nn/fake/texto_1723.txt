on thursday  hillary clinton ripped donald trump and his bigoted administration apart for being on the wrong side of history and refusing to defend lgbt rights   and while she was at it  she showed conservatives just what they missed out on by letting a former reality television star get into the white house instead of a well qualified politician at a fundraiser for lgbt community organization the center  clinton received an award and gave a speech in which she thanked her audience for their continued support  however  her message came with a chilling warning about the trump administration as she said the progress that we fought for  that many of you were on the front lines for  it may not be as secure as we once expected   clinton blasted trump  we may not ever be able to count on this administration to lead on lgbt issues  then  she couldn t resist rattling off several of the things trump has been doing to directly attack and weaken the lgbt community  she said  when this administration rescinded protections for transgender students  my heart broke  when i learned about the proposed cuts in funding for hiv and aids research  i thought about all of our efforts to try and achieve an aids free generation  some of the changes that we re seeing should seem small  but they matter a great deal if you re the person affected  others carry historic significance  like the future of the supreme court  while clinton was not always a supporter of same sex marriage  she had changed her tone several years ago and has been a powerful ally since  in her usual classy way  she called on americans to stick together and unite to protect human rights and resist homophobia  clinton said  i know the election hit a lot of us hard  i can tell you this  even when it feels tempting to pull the covers over your heads  please keep going  clinton s skilled and powerful delivery is something that trump could only dream to emulate one day  despite having lost the election to trump  the majority of americans still love and support clinton  as trump s approval rating plummets by the day  the support for her message shows that america no longer supports the values of the gop any longer  and that conservatives have made a major mistake by putting trump in the white house you can watch clinton s speech below  featured image via drew angerer and mark wilson   getty images
