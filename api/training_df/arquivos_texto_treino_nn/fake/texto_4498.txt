nobody shouted  all lives matter  until people started saying   black lives matter   there s an easy  albeit disgusting  reason for that and it s because the  all lives matter  crowd is uncomfortable with actually focusing on massive social problems that they perpetuate  also  the crowd that tends to shout  all lives matter   is overwhelmingly  white  straight  cisgender  and judeo christian but  all lives matter  isn t racist  sexist  religion phobic  transphobic  homophobic  or anything at all to this crowd there s a facebook post making the rounds that describes the hypocrisy of this white  straight  cis  judeo christian crowd that s feeling left out because we say  black lives matter   it s absolutely brilliant  it s so brilliant that it s easier to post it than it is to explain it image via facebookand there is the hypocrisy in all its vile glory  holloman s take on  all lives matter  is amazing  all lives do not matter  the only lives that matter to the  all lives matter  crowd are those of the straight  white  cis  judeo christian crowd  they wouldn t know the meaning of the word  all  if it came up and spit fire in their faces explaining why  all lives matter  is such a terrible thing to say first takes convincing that particular crowd that there s even a problem  white people who like that phrase won t acknowledge there s a problem  as recent  blatant racism from various officials has demonstrated  so saying the black community is still oppressed  and floating statistics  telling stories  even getting first hand accounts and testimonials to prove it  is a massive waste of time these analogies might be a waste of time  too  but they explain it a little better  alllivesmatter is like i go to the dr for a broken arm and he says  all bones matter  ok but right now let s take care of this broken one  belac micheal     july     alllivesmatter is like running through a cancer fundraiser   saying  there s other diseases too  judes   judychen  july    alllivesmatter is like someone tweeting  pray for nice  and i say  what about all the other cities in the world  they ve suffered too   nomnso     july     if these aren t enough  how about this  your house is on fire and the fire department is pouring water on it  trying to put the fire out  your neighbor  whose house isn t burning  comes over and says   my house needs water too  hellooooo   why are we ignoring my house and focusing only on yours    what are you going to say in short   black lives matter  is calling attention to an emergency situation like the ones above  black lives do not matter nearly as much as white lives  and it s a serious problem  but holloman s post illustrates not just the ignorance and offensiveness of  all lives matter   but it shines a very uncomfortable light on those who continue to utter that phrase holloman is right  they really don t know what  all  means featured image by mark makela getty images
