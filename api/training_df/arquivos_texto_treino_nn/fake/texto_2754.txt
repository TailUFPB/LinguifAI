when ellen degeneres found out that donald trump watched finding dory as his immigration ban was causing worldwide chaos  she used it as a teaching moment on friday  trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people traveling from seven countries from entering the united states  international outrage ensued as people and governments around the globs condemned the ban and protests raged across the country on sunday  trump watched the disney pixar film in the white house as the protests continued and apparently learned nothing from watching it so on tuesday  degeneres told trump what he should have learned  i don t get political  so i m not gonna talk about the travel ban   degeneres began   i m just gonna talk about the very nonpolitical  family friendly  people s choice award winning finding dory  degeneres explained that the character of dory lives in the ocean near australia  but she decides to travel to america to find her parents  whom she remembers after getting her memory jogged  dory and her friends reach california  only to find a wall standing in their way and they proceed to do what is necessary to get around the obstacle finding dory is about a fish named dory and dory lives in australia  these are here parents  they live in america  i don t know what religion they are but her dad sounds a little jewish  doesn t matter  dory arrives in america with her friends marlin and nemo and she ends up at the marine life institute behind a large wall  they all have to get over the wall and you won t believe it but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out    even though dory gets into america  she gets separated from her family  other animals help dory   animals that don t even need her  animals that don t have anything in common with her  they help her even though they re completely different colors because that s what you do when you see someone in need  you help them here s the video via youtube indeed  walls are a main obstacle throughout the movie  but the characters find a way to circumvent them every time  just as immigrants are going to circumvent trump s massive and expensive wall along the southern border as the berlin wall teaches us  people will find a way no matter how deadly the risks are at least   people entered west germany across the heavily guarded wall to escape the tyranny of the soviet union   people died trying if people are desperate enough  they will find a way to live in america  travel bans and walls will not stop immigrants and refugees from seeking a better life for themselves and their families featured image via screenshot
