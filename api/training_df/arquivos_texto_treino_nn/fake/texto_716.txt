donald trump s new pick for communications director  anthony scaramucci  is apparently so enamored with trump that it s come between him and his wife  at least according to the new york post s page six scaramucci s wife  deidre ball  was a vice president in investor relations for scaramucci s former company  skybridge capital  according to page six  ball is filing for divorce because of scaramucci s ambition and his desire to get close to trump  who she can t stand  they have been married for three years and have two children together one source told page six   deidre has left him and has filed for divorce  she liked the nice wall street life and their home on long island  not the insane world of d c  she is tired of his naked ambition  which is so enormous that it left her at her wits  end  she has left him even though they have two children together  a second source close to scaramucci   who has alternately not been wearing his wedding ring  or has been sporting it on his right hand   said the former couple had fought over his loyalty to trump  this was his second marriage and ball was noticeably not present at his recent salt conference in mid may the new york post is traditionally one of the few media outlets that refuses to report on everything negative about the trump administration and  maybe the reason this story made the papers is that it s all about scaramucci s swooning love affair with trump  the mooch   as scaramucci refers to himself  admires trump s alleged athletic abilities  i ve seen this guy throw a dead spiral through a tire  i ve seen him at madison square garden with a topcoat on  he s standing in the key and he s hitting foul shots and swishing them  ok  he sinks  foot putts  source  newsweekin fact  during his initial press briefing  the mooch used the word  love   times  and most of them were about trump  i love the president  and i m very  very loyal to the president  and i love the mission that the president has  okay  since the early days of the campaign when i went to these rallies and i saw the love that the people had for the president  and i grew up in the middle class  and so there s a struggle out there  the president saw that before i did  i wish i could tell you i saw it before him  but he taught it to me  and i feel that struggle and have empathy for that struggle  and i want to be here to help him make things better for the american people what do you want to bet that his wife doesn t receive the same sort of adulation  brava to ball  though  for standing up for her principles and for her perfectly normal hatred of donald trump featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
