judge neil gorsuch  trump s nominee for the supreme court seat that s sat empty since antonin scalia died a year ago  has joined the ranks of the outraged when it comes to trump and his damned twitter account  gorsuch is specifically upset with trump s statements about the judiciary branch of the government  and told sen  richard blumenthal that in a meeting earlier today  he said very specifically that they were demoralizing and disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that way   blumenthal said of gorsuch   i said they were more than disheartening and i said to him that he has an obligation to make his views clear to the american people  so they understand how abhorrent or unacceptable president trump s attacks on the judiciary are  for someone who sits on the bench  it s easy to see how that would be disheartening and demoralizing  an attack doesn t have to be directed squarely at you to still feel like an attack  trump attacked our entire judicial system and insulted all the judges within it when he went off on judge robart for blocking his muslim ban  gorsuch told sen  chuck schumer as much  too the  circuit court of appeals has been hearing arguments on the legality of the muslim ban  and apparently the three judges hearing that case gave the lawyers arguing a really tough time  they grilled the lawyer representing the department of justice on whether the government even had evidence that the seven countries named in the ban are connected to terrorism it s a pointed question because saudi arabia  which does have strong ties to terrorism and has exported terrorism to the u s   is not included in the ban  when august flentje refused to answer it and instead tried again to argue that trump has broad authority in this area  judge michelle friedland asked  are you arguing then that the president s decision in that regard is unreviewable  by a court   flentje s answer was yes  in other words  flentje argues that trump can do what s necessary in his judgement to keep the u s  safe  and a court can t say otherwise  that s part of what robart weighed when he blocked the muslim ban  the  circuit will end up on trump s radar here pretty quickly if they uphold robart s decision then gorsuch will have to determine whether he wants to serve on a court that s going to be the subject of juvenile attacks when they rule in a way that trump doesn t like  his confirmation hearing is coming up  he probably won t withdraw  but he has a lot to think about right now read more featured image by alex wong via getty images
