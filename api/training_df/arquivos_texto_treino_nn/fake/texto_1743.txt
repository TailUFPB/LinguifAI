rep  jason chaffetz  r utah  has been a thorn in the side of democrats ever since hillary clinton was secretary of state  he blamed her for many things that clearly were beyond her control  most notably the attacks on the compound in benghazi  libya  that wound up taking the lives of multiple america diplomats  after that attack  chaffetz  who chairs the house oversight committee  spent more than two years and millions in taxpayer money to keep investigating hillary   each time coming up empty because she did nothing wrong  he even said he had investigations lined up in the event that hillary took the white house  well  now that trump is president and there are no more clinton investigations to keep his base salivating  chaffetz has announced that there will be no  congressional race for him chaffetz took to facebook wednesday morning to announce his decision  and  of course  he insists that it was not a politically motivated move  after long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration  i have decided i will not be a candidate for any office in   for those that would speculate otherwise  let me be clear that i have no ulterior motives  i am healthy  i am confident i would continue to be re elected by large margins  i have the full support of speaker ryan to continue as chairman of the oversight and government reform committee  that said  i have made a personal decision to return to the private sector  here is the embed of the full facebook post despite what chaffetz is saying regarding his reasons for not running again  it s likely a pack of lies  after all  he made it his mission to destroy hillary clinton  and made it clear that he would continue to try and get her on something  anything were she to be elected president  however  now that we have trump as president instead of hillary  chaffetz is choosing to turn a blind eye to all of trump s scandals  he refuses to look into trump s conflicts of interest  is mum on the russia investigation for the most part  and has nothing to say on trump s lies and obvious character flaws and deficiencies  in short   as long as the president is a republican  he can trample the law into pieces all he wants this stance would have likely been problematic for chaffetz in the  congressional race  to say the least  his state largely loathed trump  and the alternative conservative candidate and  nevertrump media star evan mcmullin got a good chunk of the vote  in short   chaffetz would have been primaried  and would have likely suffered a crushing defeat there  instead of risking that  he is choosing to bow out early  and use lame excuses to do so all i can say is good riddance  you nasty little tool  we won t be missing you featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
