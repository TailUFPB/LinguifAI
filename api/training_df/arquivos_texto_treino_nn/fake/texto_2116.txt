the republican party is constantly pushing back against accusations of being a racist institution  despite the fact that they endorse and celebrate racists in their ranks  hell  they even tolerate outright white supremacists  case in point   representative steve king   r iowa   rep  king has a long history of racially charged remarks  but here lately he has really gone over the top  most recently with a tweet that was nothing more than a white supremacist rant about how american can t keep its population up with  quote   somebody else s babies  wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny  we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies  https   t co   steve king   stevekingia  march    course  the backlash from democrats and other people who aren t complete racist pieces of shit was swift  but many of his republican colleagues were curiously silent at king s blatant racism  well  now  king himself has given us the answer as to why the condemnation didn t come from elected gop officials as it should  because  privately  they agree with him  king said  my colleagues have generally been coming by and patting me on the back  and a surprising number have said that they pray for me  and  meaning they support me and they agree with me  a surprising number  i don t often have members come up and say at the end of the day   i prayed for you this morning   so they must think i ve got a lot of arrows in my back  the only republicans who condemned king s offensive remarks were those who are the children of immigrants themselves  rep  carlos curbelo  r   florida  tweeted at king   stevekingia what exactly do you mean  do i qualify as  somebody else s baby    concernedgopcolleague  carlos curbelo   carloslcurbelo  march     ileana ros lehtinen  r florida  also voiced her anger at king via twitter get a clue   stevekingia  diversity is our strength  all looking alike is such a waste  a travesty  i wanna be me  all others are taken  https   t co   ileana ros lehtinen   roslehtinen  march    of the aforementioned lawmakers are cuban american  when asked if he had spoken to any of his colleagues about the comments  king apparently lied  saying  they have not approached me  but i would say of my republican critics  you should take a look on their position on immigration and see where they stand  there seems to be a curious coincidence  when rep  curbelo heard what king has said  the remarks were greeted with an eyeroll  and he said  i saw him down at conference  and i said   hey  i just want to know if i m somebody else s baby   he said   you should have called me   i said   i don t have your number   so he sent me his number and we agreed we d talk whenever we both time to sit down and talk about it  hopefully  they can work it out  but something tells me there s absolutely nothing that will curb steve kings open white supremacy  unfortunately  it seems that the bulk of the gop agrees  then again  we already knew that featured image via bill clark cq roll call
