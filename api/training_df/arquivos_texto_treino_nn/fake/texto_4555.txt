the whole world is talking about donald trump  over which he is no doubt preening because any attention is good attention as long as it s focused entirely on him  but besides the obvious problems with this  there s one tradition that s very important among international leaders and diplomats  trump is getting dangerously close to destroying it the tradition is this  you don t trash talk a foreign country s political candidates that might seem silly  it might seem trivial  it s not  this is a very old tradition that was actually turned into policy at the  vienna convention  while different countries interpret  thou shalt not interfere in foreign countries  elections  differently  most are careful to keep their mouths shut  at least publicly  even in   when the whole world hated george w  bush for the fiasco that was iraq  foreign diplomats and leaders mostly kept quiet not so now  trump is testing everyone s patience  and many find that they just can t keep it to themselves  if you represent one of these countries that has been insulted or attacked  you tend to react  we are very passionate  and our blood is pretty hot  but we have to play it cool and understand that this is a campaign  and an election  and that we are diplomats  this week  thousands of foreign diplomats are gathering in new york city for the u n  general assembly  trump has insulted a great many of them in one way or another  what the latin american diplomat said to politico is true around the world  adding to the complications is that u s  elections are increasingly followed intensely by people overseas  whether it s via facebook or cnn international  so when a u s  presidential candidate slams a foreign country as trump has so often  with mexico  japan  china  members of nato  and on and on  representatives of those countries feel unusual domestic pressure to respond  wars of words could easily escalate into more serious wars with trump  he s proven that with his threats against both ted cruz and john kasich for the  midterms   he can t let a slight go as another example of how he goes after everyone who pisses him off  he s busy trash talking a scottish whiskey company for daring to give an award to a neighbor of his who criticizes his golf course  in retaliation  he s banned every brand of whiskey from william grant   sons for that affront  because really  how dare they he should have more important things to worry about than petty personal slights  but they re actually the centerpiece of his whole existence  when foreign leaders won t play ball his way  and go on record with nothing but what he thinks are insults  what s he going to do  two guesses what he ll do  but you ll only need one he hasn t even been elected yet and foreign leaders and diplomats are openly attacking him  some of these people probably held their tongues when george w  was running for re election  however hard that might have been  this would be hilarious if it wasn t so frightening featured image by joe raedle getty images
