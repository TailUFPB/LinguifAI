sean penn is not exactly one to mince words  and he didn t mince words when he was asked about the time he worked with steve bannon on a film project  bannon has a heavy history of bankrolling and doing other work on films  even as recently as   he was an executive producer for  the indian runner   which was penn s first time directing penn was not nice when talking about bannon  and that s putting it mildly  he actually said  bannon was then  as he is now  simply another bitter hollywood wannabe who went rogue by way of toxic narcissistic iconoclasm  but  deep in his heart  he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind  and then there are also the bad things about him and then there are also the bad things about him  wow  just wow  we ve known since bannon came into the spotlight a year ago that he was a complete dick who loves bullying people  earlier this year  film critic ann hornaday wrote a piece for the washington post that talks about what we can learn about bannon from watching the films he made many of his films are directly tied to his worldview   in fact  he s an extreme right wing version of michael moore in that respect  he s spent a lot of time attacking  the permanent political class   in his films  along with  hippies and community organizers  who allegedly hate this country and hate the constitution  he s gone after hillary clinton and president obama  but also dick cheney and george w  bush  in short  he hates the whole world and everyone in it who doesn t see it exactly the way he does which seems to be exactly what penn was describing in his mini diatribe bannon is also someone who issues threats and ultimatums and strong arms people into doing things his way  his narcissistic ego likely suffered a massive blow when he tried to bully republicans on their farce of a healthcare bill by saying   this is not a discussion  this is not a debate  you have no choice but to vote for this bill  even before that sorry excuse of a bill failed  just the idea of republicans not following his orders was enough for him to urge trump to create a  shit list   when republicans scoffed in his general direction over his  orders   it was very likely a humiliating defeat for him so  he s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind   is a damned accurate description of him image of sean penn by frazer harrison getty images for the hollywood reporter  image of steve bannon by chip somodevilla getty images
