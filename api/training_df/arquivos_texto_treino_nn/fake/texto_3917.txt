the apparent increase among latino voters in key early voting states seems to be triggering something of a public meltdown with republican presidential nominee donald trump  at a campaign event in nevada  the former reality tv star began spinning a new conspiracy theory as donald trump swept his campaign across the country in a final sprint  he claimed that long lines in clark county  nevada  were evidence of electoral wrongdoing  it s being reported that certain key democratic polling locations in clark county were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring democratic voters in   trump said  folks  it s a rigged system  it s a rigged system  and we re going to beat it   he said trump wasn t alone  michael mcdonald  the state chairman of the nevada republican party made an explicitly racist complaint about the surge in early voters at the same event noting   they kept a poll open until  o clock at night so a certain group could vote  early indicators show that republicans are in big trouble in the key swing state of nevada  clark county  home to las vegas and the state s largest population  is also over   latino  the area has been targeted by the clinton campaign for early voting  as well as by the political operation of senate minority leader harry reid  d nv  a strong performance there has led to a situation where the trump ticket is behind the eight ball before election day has even begun  nevada political analyst jon ralston has already said that there is only a tiny sliver of hope for trump  which may explain his bluster and frustration at the campaign event trump launched his campaign with an attack on latinos  calling mexican immigrants criminals and rapists and promising to build a wall along the southern border to keep latinos out  it appears that they heard him loud and clear and are hell bent on destroying his campaign featured image via flickr
