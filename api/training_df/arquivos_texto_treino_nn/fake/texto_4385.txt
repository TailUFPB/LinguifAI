donald trump is an unpatriotic loser  says real billionaire mark cuban  because true patriots actually pay their damn taxes in   the republican nominee wrote off a   million loss on his tax returns in order to get away with not paying any federal income taxes for the next  years while he continued to make hundreds of millions of dollars annually as we all should know  taxes pay for a lot of the things that make our society great such as police  firefighters  hospitals  the military  roads  education  and many other things that are too numerous to mention  but trump got to enjoy the benefits of the things taxes pay for without having to contribute a single penny to pay for them  the rest of us  including hillary clinton and mark cuban picked up that tab so cuban phoned in to cnn on tuesday  and while he conceded that what trump did is legal  he proceeded to blast him for failing to explain his actions  the key question  after showing a   million loss  is how much money does he owe still  who does he owe it to  was that debt forgiven   because if it was forgiven  that s going to eat up that net operating loss   cuban said   debt forgiveness is the same as income  he hasn t explained any of those things in any way  shape or form  that s a problem  cuban then dinged trump for not taking personal responsibility for his mistakes and declared that trump is unfit to be president because of that refusal  the problem with donald trump and why he s unfit to be president  is that he won t own his mistakes  we all make mistakes  i ve had companies go belly up  i say it all the time  it doesn t matter how many times you fail  you only have to be right one time and everybody will tell you how lucky you are  just own the mistake and explain it  the problem is there s no transparency  and he won t own his mistakes  and we don t want someone like that who s ashamed of what they ve done in the business world  being president means the buck stops at your desk  which means trump can t blame his underlings for all the bad decisions will likely make as president  we need a president that takes responsibility  not one that makes excuses but cuban continued slamming trump for referring to himself as a  smart  for not paying taxes  that s just wrong  i say it all the time  after military service  the most patriotic thing you can do as a wealthy person is pay your taxes  because that keeps the roads paved  the military paid and kids going to school  he obviously doesn t understand the concept  here s the video via twitter mark cuban responds to a report that donald trump may have legally avoided paying taxes for about two decades https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  october    is absolutely right  trump should pay his taxes like everyone else does because it would be unamerican to not pay them  former supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes once said that by paying taxes we buy civilization  by not paying taxes  trump is freeloading off the rest of us featured image via screenshot
