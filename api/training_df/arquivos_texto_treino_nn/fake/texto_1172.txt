as the russian investigation is getting uncomfortably close to home for donald trump and as his insistence on profiting from the office of the presidency could come crashing down on his head  the white house is panicking  this time  though  the staff doesn t seem to care  after trump delivered a july  ultimatum to his chief of staff reince priebus  he laughed it off politico reports that trump set july  as a deadline for a staff shakeup  this is at least the third such ultimatum trump has given his chief of staff and none of them  so far  have come to fruition  he threatened priebus on the  day mark of his presidency and then again as memorial day approached  the shakeups never happened and priebus still has his job  it s become comical that every holiday becomes a referendum on reince   said one adviser to the president sensing his impending doom even before he was criticized for fallout related to the firing of fbi director james comey  reince had joked   i ve got one foot on a banana peel and another out the door   according to a person with knowledge of the conversation source  politicothis time  though  trump means it for realz  he even floated some names as replacements  oh  wait  he s actually done that before trump has openly floated the idea of other potential chiefs of staff  including former campaign aide david urban and wayne berman  a blackstone executive and advisor to blackstone ceo steve schwarzman  shortly after national security adviser michael flynn was fired in february  trump invited new jersey gov  chris christie to the white house to help brainstorm about a new chief of staff  according to a white house official and outside adviser with knowledge of the situation what trump doesn t seem to realize  or perhaps he does  is that firing priebus isn t going to help him with his legal problems  an entirely new staff isn t going to help him  trump is in over his head and he refuses to learn or even to listen to advice while he might be sincere this time  the more likely story is that trump simply wants to change the headlines for the day  rumors of a staff shakeup take the focus off the russian investigation  sort of featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
