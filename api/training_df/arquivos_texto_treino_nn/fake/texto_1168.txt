once again  donald trump s muslim ban was smacked down by the  circuit court of appeals on monday  upholding an injunction preventing trump s executive order aimed at keeping muslims from entering the country from going into effect  further  the order runs afoul of other provisions of the ina that prohibit nationality based discrimination and require the president to follow a specific process when setting the annual cap on the admission of refugees   the decision reads   on these statutory bases  we affirm in large part the district court s order preliminarily enjoying sections  and  of the executive order  as predicted  trump s own tweets about what trump calls both a  travel ban  and  not a ban  were a major reason the justice department had no chance of successfully fighting for his bigoted order  indeed  the president recently confirmed his assessment that it is the  countries  that are inherently dangerous  rather than the  million individual nationals of those countries who are barred from entry under the president s  travel ban  this is the tweet the three judge panel is referencing that s right  we need a travel ban for certain dangerous countries  not some politically correct term that won t help us protect our people   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    judges even made white house propaganda minister sean spicer regret saying out loud that trump s tweets are considered official statements by the president of the united states  by citing his statement to that effect the fight against the president  s attempt to keep jews muslims from entering the country is not over  we re winning   but the matter will now head to the supreme court  on which trump recently installed someone on whom he can count to do the wrong thing   always featured image via getty images
