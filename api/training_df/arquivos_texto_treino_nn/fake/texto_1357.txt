donald trump has become increasingly paranoid and frustrated as the investigation into ties between his  presidential campaign  his outside associates  and perhaps even himself and the russian government heats up  there have already been two rounds of subpoenas issued to trump s disgraced national security adviser  michael flynn  regarding this matter  further  it doesn t help that trump s own white house is leaking like a sieve to the new york times and the washington post regarding the chaos within   especially when it comes to the handling of the russia matter  things are so worrisome at this point that trump has already hired outside lawyers to represent him  so  how is team trump planning to handle all the scandal that continues to plague their white house  why  they are going to wage war on investigators and leakers   for years  if necessary axios is reporting that trump will have his  street fighters  devise a plan to target leaks from within the intelligence community and other parts of the government with zeal  and they also have come to realize that the russia investigation is not going away just because they want it to  they cannot fire or lie their way out of this one  and the press isn t going to let go of a story this big  according to a trump backer  they are ready for this fight  the white house is embracing the fight  which is going to last as long as donald trump is president  we re getting street fighters ready to go  axios has also obtained a detailed a  war room  plan regarding this escalating war between the white house and the rest of the government the thing is  though  that the trump white house can t even function on a day to day basis  they aren t even staffed up like a normal white house would be by now  the same goes for other major administration agencies  such as the state department  further  the chaos inside barely allows the staffers to get anything at all done other than try to control trump s television time  feed him positive news so that he doesn t go off the rails too often  and to control his tweeting   which they seem to be failing miserable at the idea that these incompetent wannabe authoritarians are any match for the apparatus of the united states government is downright laughable  likely  we ll just get even more self incrimination and meme worthy buffoonery out of this plan good luck  trump staffers  you ll need it featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
