so  aside from the gop s premature statement that pence won the debate tonight  who is really winning  who is going to win when all is said and done  probably the onion and  the daily show  the onion ran a story with the following headline   moderator reminds vice presidential debate audience to remain silent when exiting early   it was already assumed that this debate wouldn t have nearly the spirit of the presidential debates  but the onion took it nine steps further with this  quote  from the moderator  elaine quijano  it s crucial that you stay in a single file line and make sure to keep moving in an orderly fashion so the aisles are clear for others attempting to leave their seats  and please abstain from slamming the door so as not to disturb those audience members who are sleeping    the daily show s  live feed included a picture of a glass of milk with a tie  and some toast with a tie the allusion is to milquetoast  which refers to a  comic book character  caspar milquetoast  who was timid  and now is a general reference to people who are meek or timid  accompanying that image was audio from the actual debate  it s also an illustration that the vp candidates do seem to remain in the background of each campaign the general expectation was a very boring debate and both of these demonstrate that expectation very well  however  we did end up with quite a bit of spirit between kaine and pence  probably a lot more than expected  either way  it s pretty clear that it s the onion and  the daily show  that won the debate tonight  hands down featured image by chip somodevilla getty images
