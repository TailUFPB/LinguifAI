trump  like george w  bush before him  thinks a  tax holiday  on repatriated money will spur major corporations who are currently hoarding money overseas to bring that money back and invest it in america  they fail to take into account that  like other tax breaks  companies are not going to build new factories  plants  offices or stores and hire more people if consumer demand doesn t warrant it  instead  they ll pocket the money they save in one of any number of ways  and regular americans won t benefit one iota from it that s what they ll do with trump s tax holiday  this isn t speculation or conjecture  this is something to which they literally admit  bank of america merrill lynch conducted a survey of more than  companies over the summer  asking them what they d do with all that money they bring back from overseas  their top two responses were the following  pay down debt  and buy back their own stocks the idea that they d use the money for stock buybacks is especially upsetting since this is a known method for artificially driving stock prices up  rich executives and shareholders then get even richer  workers see no benefit from it  and the unemployed and underemployed don t see new job opportunities popping up literally  the whole point of this practice is to make the rich richer when george w  did this in   companies voluntarily brought over   million back in from overseas    million went to stock buybacks  let that sink in for a moment    percent of the money brought back in from overseas went to stock buybacks  companies took advantage of that tax holiday to inflate their stock prices and get richer  there was no economic growth from that the companies that brought back the most money actually turned right around and laid people off let that sink in as well there will be no economic growth from trump s tax break  companies are not so broke that they can t afford to expand without some of the money they re hoarding elsewhere and protection from repatriation taxes  they don t need this money to build anything or hire new workers  this is nothing more than the government enabling companies to enrich themselves  possibly at the expense of the americans trump claims to love so much  the only way to spur economic growth is to help the consumer class afford to spend their money again  but we can t expect that from trump   he parrots republican talking points on this because he knows he can use them to make himself and his most loyal rich buddies richer featured image via ron sachs pool getty images
