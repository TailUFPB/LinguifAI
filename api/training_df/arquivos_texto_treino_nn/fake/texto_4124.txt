 midnight host chris hardwick found it very amusing to listen to melania trump complain about how  damaging  social media is to children when her own husband says incredibly offensive and outrageous things on twitter every day  yesterday  anderson cooper interviewed former divorcee melania trump and asked her what she d try to accomplish if she becomes first lady   hardwick began his show on tuesday night before playing a clip of melania talking about how she wants to change social media  the social media  it s very damaging for the children   she claimed   we need to guide them and teach them about social media because i see a lot of negativity on it  yeah  that s right  melania trump actually wants to focus her time as first lady cleaning up the  negativity  on social media  but does that include her own husband s twitter account because as hardwick proceeded to point out  donald trump has been posting remarks that go far beyond negative ever since he joined the platform in   i wonder why she thinks there s a lot of negativity on social media   hardwick said before scrolling through images of trump s twitter posts   i don t know  maybe it s because one of the only people she follows does stuff like call other people  unattractive both inside and out   or  a low class slob   or  a dopey clown   or  a total asshole   or  a p ssy   or  they look like shit   or  disgusting with nipples protruding   hardwick then delivered the perfect advice to melania if she really wants to make social media less negative  why would melania wait until she s first lady to reduce negativity on social media when she could just as easily replace her husband s phone with an exploding samsung galaxy note   hardwick then turned to the comedians on the panel and asked them what other goals melania has  which included  designing grab proof women s underwear  and  whatever goals michelle obama has  here s the video via comedy central just like her husband  melani trump should really stop talking  because every time they open their mouths  comedians get new material to mercilessly mock them with featured image  screenshot
