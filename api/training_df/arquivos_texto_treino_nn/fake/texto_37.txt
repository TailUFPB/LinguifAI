we ve all heard the stories of donald trump preferring a well done steak with ketchup and shunning any new delicacies  despite living a lifestyle that offers him all the luxuries one could ever desire  however  it s not just that the president has terrible gastronomical taste  a new memoir suggests that his diet is one of several poor lifestyle choices that could very well shorten his life according to an excerpt from let trump be trump  an upcoming book by trump s former campaign manager corey lewandowski and aide david bossie  we get to enter the inner circle where the president of the united states having a   calorie mcdonald s dinner is par for the course  trump s appetite seems to know no bounds when it comes to mcdonald s  with a dinner order consisting of two big macs  two filet o fish  and a chocolate malted   is just one of the claims made in the book  to put that meal in perspective  trump s dinner contains   grams of sodium  despite the american heart foundation recommending just   grams per day  plus enough white bread to last most people a week  remember  this is just one meal  but it only gets worse  on trump force one there were four major food groups  mcdonald s  kentucky fried chicken  pizza  and diet coke   the authors write about traveling with trump during the early days of his presidency  but there may be a valid reason for it   not only is he a fan of manufacturing  trump is also a renowned germaphobe who allegedly won t eat from a package that has already been opened  which would also explain the plane s cupboards being stacked with vienna fingers  potato chips  pretzels  and many packages of oreos   those well done steaks make a little more sense now  as well  but a little bit of bacteria is probably the least of the president s worries  this is a  year old man who gets next to no exercise  it s hard to include his golf when he barely even walks while playing   gets very little sleep  and is constantly throwing tantrums  so add in that diet and you have the perfect recipe for a heart attack  the diet alone  especially the snacks  is almost an open invite for diabetes  too what makes this frightening for the rest of us is that this is a man who is currently responsible for a nuclear standoff with north korea  as well as dealing with rapidly warming oceans and an ever increasing tax bill  if he has this lack of concern for his own wellbeing  then what does it say of his risk assessment abilities featured image via win mcnamee getty images
