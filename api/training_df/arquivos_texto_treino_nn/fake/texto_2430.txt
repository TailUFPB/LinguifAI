when white house spokesliar sean spicer demanded that the anne frank center praise donald trump for  for the first time since he became president  denouncing the rash of antisemitic violence and other crime that has popped up since his election traditionally  trump has been terrible with even acknowledging that bad things happen to jewish people  even omitting them from his holocaust announcement  but for the first time   that can t be emphasized enough   he named jews as the actual victims of antisemitism  the anti semitic threats targeting our jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil  while some praised trump for  finally doing the right thing  for most it was too little too late   especially when it s considered that his staff is overflowing with nazis  white nationalists  white supremacists  alt righters  and other synonyms  his statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting antisemitism  yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record   steven goldstein  executive director of the anne frank center for mutual respect  wrote in a facebook post   make no mistake  the antisemitism coming out of this administration is the worst we have ever seen from any administration   he added  the white house repeatedly refused to mention jews in its holocaust remembrance  and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of holocaust denial  and it was only yesterday  presidents  day  that jewish community centers across the nation received bomb threats  and the president said absolutely nothing  when president trump responds to antisemitism proactively and in real time  and without pleas and pressure  that s when we ll be able to say this president has turned a corner  this is not that moment  i think he s been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their religion  because of their gender  because of the color of their skin   spicer lied in response   it is something that he s going to continue to fight and make very  very clear has he has no place in this administration  trump  of course  chose an  alt right  scumbag named stephen miller  who has ties to white supremacist richard spencer  as a senior adviser and has handed anti semitic  racist hatemonger steve bannon so much power that  many people are saying  he s actually the president  it s ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this  it s never good enough   spicer whined  ignoring that trump literally has never actually defended persecuted  jewish people before  the anne frank center  he says  needs to get with the program and sing the donald s praises  i wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area  and i think that hopefully as time continues to go by  they recognize his commitment to civil rights  to voting rights  to equality for all americans  the center shot back on twitter  giving them a condition that would cause them to do that   fire the most blatant and terrible nazi on staff   whitehouse says our org should  praise   potus  realdonaldtrump on  antisemitism   then fire steve bannon  https   t co   annefrankcenter us    annefrankcenter  february     whitehouse sean spicer you are wrong to claim  potus has addressed  antisemitism many times  no   we had to beg  https   t co   annefrankcenter us    annefrankcenter  february    for  potus    whitehouse to use ivanka s religion as defense to  antisemitism   like saying some of my best daughters are jewish  annefrankcenter us    annefrankcenter  february     trump fans showed their true colors in response  totalwarcoach  annefrankcenter whoa whoa whoa  why aren t you people lampshades yet   leftism is autism   crowsm  february    annefrankcenter you really need to shut up  save your wailing for the wall  not about our president  do you want muslim immigrants    jin saotome    jinsaotome  february    murrdogg i ll put my money on them or the jewish leaders themselves  lotta hoaxes for attention  and calling trump anti semitic so quickly    jin saotome    jinsaotome  february    annefrankcenter  whitehouse  potus  realdonaldtrump why fire bannon  he isn t an anti semit  no evidence to support baseless charge   n thompson     february    hasn t exactly been the  civil rights  president his team seems to think he is   but the notion that everyone should grovel at his feet every single time he does or says something that isn t completely batsh t f cking horrifying is simply unacceptable don t be fooled by the one  gesture  he was cornered into making  he s still the same tangerine fascist he s always been featured image via getty images  joe raedle  screengrab
