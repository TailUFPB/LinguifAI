the good news  trump slowly read through his prepared remarks in front of a room full of world leaders and didn t throw up on himself or start a war  the bad news  he accidentally slipped in something he deliberately tried not to  now his aides are saying the president is just really tired cnn s jim acosta noticed that trump deviated from his prepared remarks to say the phrase  islamic terror   his advisors had urged him to stick with  islamist extremism  because it denotes that the groups committing acts of terror are using the religion of islam but do not represent it  this is a crucial point and one that middle eastern leaders  understandably  take very seriously trump s use of term  islamic terror  during speech deviated from prepared remarks which read  islamist   pic twitter com isirvzkmnc  jim acosta   acosta  may    his teams best efforts  trump botched it  an  oversight  they confessed to reporters it was likely an  oversight  i m told  https   t co   jim acosta   acosta  may    for clarification  trump s staff told acosta that trump made the mistake because he s exhausted  he s apparently bone tired   despite this being only his second full day overseas in keeping with trump s staff s tradition of treating him like a  year old  the anonymous aide said of trump  he s just an exhausted guy  he s tuckered out news that trump couldn t handle even two days overseas tickled hillary clinton supporters  who had long said that her record setting amount of travel while working as secretary of state under obama made her uniquely qualified to become president in   her own staff spoke in awe when describing an insane   mile  day journey they were on as part of a diplomatic trip  clinton  for her part  joked near the end of it that she could have handled more one well traveled clinton staffer described the france afghanistan japan mongolia vietnam laos cambodia egypt israel itinerary as  especially absurd  even for us  despite the mind  and body numbing time zone hopping  clinton joked that she was ready for more  i appreciate being here  i am only sorry that i have to leave   she told reporters on her last stop monday  in israel  by comparison  trump demanded his own trip be cut in half and promptly became  exhausted  on the second day  and you don t need to take his staff s word for it  video taken at trump s speech shows a slouching  frowning trump  at times he seems barely awake i mean seriously the sick irony is that trump made much of his ugly presidential campaign about falsely smearing hillary clinton as  sickly  and  low energy   neither smear was accurate  but like many of trump s attacks  one gets the sense that he was projecting his own insecurities onto his opponents how would hillary clinton have handled her first overseas trip  we ll never know  but given her history  it s safe to say she wouldn t complain of needing a nap at the very start featured image via nbc news
