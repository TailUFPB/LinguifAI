kellyanne conway finally got buried by a barrage of questions calling her and trump out for being hypocrites  and it was totally epic when fbi director james comey first cleared hillary clinton of any wrongdoing  donald trump attacked comey and called the system rigged  and then trump did the opposite when comey announced the discovery of some more emails  now donald trump is once again attacking comey during an interview on cnn  anderson cooper asked conway to explain why trump is still saying that hillary is going to be indicted when the facts don t support him  wasn t it irresponsible of him at that point to be saying such things without having any facts  particularly now that comey has come forward and said there was nothing there   cooper asked conway then launched into complaints that hillary s campaign attacked comey  only to be reminded by cooper that trump s campaign has done the same thing every time they didn t get the result they wanted cooper asked his original question again  and conway still refused to answer by attacking clinton  conway also reasoned that it s okay for trump to speculate without facts because some people on cnn have done so  but cooper told conway that  just because people jump off a bridge doesn t mean you should   conway finally was forced to say that she doesn t think trump is being irresponsible conway then whined about hillary going negative against trump  which forced cooper to remind her that trump has been going negative throughout his campaign then conway swerved again and focused on the clinton foundation  but once again  cooper foiled her talking points by noting that we know more about the clinton foundation than we know about trump s tax returns  because unlike trump  hillary released documents  isn t it a little hypocritical to be using information that you know about the foundation because they actually have released all of their financial records when your candidate hasn t done any of that   cooper asked of course  conway denied the blatant hypocrisy and quizzed cooper to answer how trump made his money  cooper zinged back by saying people build buildings and trump slaps his name on them for licensing fees  which made conway cry foul conway then returned to whining about hillary s campaign attacking comey after praising him in july  but again  cooper hit conway with the fact that trump has also gone back and forth attacking and praising comey and then conway claimed that hillary had her maid print out information  cooper flattened that claim by pointing out that it was a story by the new york post that hasn t been confirmed finally  conway claimed that hillary is desperate by hanging out with performers like beyonce and jay z  but claimed that people are only going to those rallies to see the celebrity singers  but when cooper pointed out that ted nugent is appearing with trump at rallies conway insisted that people are going to those rallies to see donald trump here s the video via youtube over and over again  kellyanne conway flat out committed hypocrisy and got called out for it by cooper  how she can actually look herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she is lying and being a hypocrite every day is a mystery  but when this election is over  conway should never be allowed to work again in politics or in the media  and donald trump certainly should not be allowed to become president featured image  screenshot
