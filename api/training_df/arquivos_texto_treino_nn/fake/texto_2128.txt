just hours before donald trump s new muslim ban was set to go into effect  a federal judge in hawaii blocked the executive order  u s  district court judge derrick watson ruled on wednesday afternoon that the travel ban still doesn t still doesn t pass legal muster  the illogic of the government s contentions is palpable  the notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed   watson wrote  equally flawed is the notion that the executive order cannot be found to have targeted islam because it applies to all individuals in the six referenced countries   watson added   it is undisputed  using the primary source upon which the government itself relies  that these six countries have overwhelmingly muslim populations that range from    to     it would therefore be no paradigmatic leap to conclude that targeting these countries likewise targets islam   watson added   certainly  it would be inappropriate to conclude  as the government does  that it does not  trump then proceeded to fly into a rage during a campaign rally in nashville  tennessee   yes  this man is seriously still holding campaign rallies  but i digress   while speaking  trump said the ruling was  terrible  and promised to take the case all the way to the supreme court if he had to  we re going to take our case as far as it needs to go  including all the way up to the supreme court   trump said  we re going to win  the danger is clear  the law is clear  the need for my executive order is clear  obviously fuming over the decision  trump insisted that judge watson ruled against his muslim ban for  political reasons   after all  it simply couldn t be because it s based on bigotry  trump said that this  makes us look weak  when it comes to fighting terrorism according to trump  his latest attempt to ban muslims from the country was tailored to the dictates of the flawed ruling  on his first ban  this is a watered down version of the first one   trump said   and let me tell you something  i think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way  which is what i wanted to to in the first place  trump also whined that he couldn t say the things he really wanted to say about the judge s decision to halt his bigoted ban because he would be  criticized  i have to be nice otherwise i ll be criticized for speaking poorly about our courts   he told the crowd   among the most dishonest people in the world  i will be criticized  you can watch this segment of trump s speech here featured image via bill pugliano getty images
