despite having run one of the most disgusting campaigns most of us have ever witnessed  the not my president elect told matt lauer of the today show that he s not to blame for the division in america  of course he did  trump was featured as time magazine person of the year on the cover wednesday  which named him  president of the divided states of america  it is a great honor  it means a lot especially me growing up reading time magazine   trump told lauer   i have been lucky enough to be on the cover many times  which is an odd statement considering he blasted time magazine in dec   on twitter when he was not chosen  lauer was quick to point that out  when you say divided states of america  i didn t divide them   trump continued to say   they re divided now  i think putting divided is snarky  but again  it s divided  i m not president yet  so i didn t do anything to divide  sure  he didn t  the future demagogue in chief called his democratic opponent  crooked hillary  at every campaign rally  working the crowd into a frenzy   lock her up   chants commenced at each of his campaign stops  hate crimes have increased  every white supremacist group across the board endorsed the acidic alleged billionaire  but he s not a divider  just ask him at that point  lauer grilled him over his use of twitter  a social site in which he has dished out conspiracy theories to his nearly  million followers  i think i am very restrained  and i talk about important things   he said  that s a modern day form of communication  i get it out much more faster than a press release  i get it out much more honestly than dealing with dishonest reporters   trump added well  if by restrained he means attacking saturday night live and the cast of the musical hamilton  then he has a point  otherwise  he s so full of shit we re going to have to attach a toilet flush to his jaw  as for not being sworn in yet  that s true  but he s the president elect and needs to put his big boy pants on so he can get to work  it s going to be a loooong four years photo by scott olson via getty
