one has to wonder how much longer kellyanne conway can keep lying for donald trump  because she is very clearly losing it on sunday  kellyanne conway clashed with cnn s brian stelter over a number of issues   most notably  the russia nonsense  as she called it during perhaps her most insane interview yet about seven minutes in  stelter attempted to explain to the unbelievably vapid conway why the  russia russia russia  story is news despite her and donald trump calling it a hoax  because journalists love america and america was attacked last year and america s probably going to be attacked again next year around the midterms  and you call it a hoax   stetler said  and that has what to do with our campaign that i managed  i managed that winning campaign   conway demanded   it has what to do with that campaign  that may be because by the time you became campaign manager  the deal was already in  the conversations were already had  we don t know  kellyanne  but shouldn t we find out   stelter replied  are you actually alleging there was active conversations with russians trying to change the election results   conway raved   because very few people are saying that  are you saying that or just trying to put it out there because you guys are so invested  what is there  what constitutional crisis are we facing right now  i ll leave that to  jeffrey toobin and the law expert  stelter said  demanding to know why trump doesn t want answers as much as the rest of americans  isn t mr  mueller and his band of democratic donors trying to do that   conway shot back  adding that americans would rather hear about trump s propaganda than the  unequal coverage on russia  watch the interview below
