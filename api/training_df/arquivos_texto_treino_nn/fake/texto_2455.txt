trump drew international attention again by claiming there was a terror attack in sweden on the night of feb    to cover his gross lie  he tweeted today that his remarks were in reference to something fox news reported  which is either just another lie  or a gross misunderstanding of a documentary fox news aired  but it seems that there really was a terror attack in sweden recently  in a city called gothenburg the suspected terrorists in this attack were neo nazis  and they attacked a refugee center in gothenburg with a homemade bomb last month  one person was seriously injured in the attack swedish intelligence said that the attack was linked to two others in gothenburg  and appeared to be politically motivated  which isn t shocking if the terrorists were white neo nazis  and members of a white supremacist group known as the nordic resistance movement  they openly preach anti semitism and racism  and they oppose non white immigration into sweden hmmm  that sounds an awful lot like all the white supremacists here in the u s  who support trump sweden has taken in more refugees per capita than anyone else in europe in   despite imposing border controls in the middle of the year  what we have now  however  are white supremacists attacking a refugee center  trump wants to blame refugees for terror attacks all across europe  but that doesn t work when the terrorists are white neo nazis this is how this administration operates  though  tell a lie  make a wild accusation  or say or do something equally outrageous  watch it get debunked or solidly smacked down  and then double down on it by either blaming it on faulty information or sticking by it anyway  and they won t acknowledge terror attacks that don t fit their anti muslim narrative featured image by olivier douliery via getty images
