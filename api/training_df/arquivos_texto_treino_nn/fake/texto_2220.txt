former clinton labor secretary and current berkeley economics professor robert reich has long been one of donald trump s most vocal opponents and he thinks trump could be done  on thursday  he took to twitter to outline four ways in which trump could already be impeached and he might just be beginning  at least according to reich reich  along with others  is saying that trump s unsubstantiated claims that obama wiretapped him are enough to impeach him reich also cited article  section  of the constitution  which  forbids government officials from taking things of value from foreign governments  trump seems to be looking at the office of the presidency as just another way to increase his personal wealth  he has refused to divest himself from his businesses  even while putting his children in charge  even before he was inaugurated  foreign diplomats began to see spending money at trump hotels as a way to cozy up to the new american leader  almost as soon as he took office  his florida resort and  weekend white house   mar a lago  doubled its initiation fee from    to a whopping     but the most egregious offense was announced on wednesday  when the associated press announced that china s trademark office gave preliminary approval to  new trump trademarks the third way trump could be impeached today  according to reich  is his violation of the first amendment  which  bars any law  respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof    trump violated this with his muslim ban  which singles out a religion the fourth is also a violation of the first amendment  which also bars  abridging the freedom of the press   trump consistently labels the media as  fake  and even as  the enemy   they are shut out of press conferences and reporters are escorted out for daring to ask tough questions while the evidence isn t yet completely in  it s looking more and more like the ties between trump and russia are treason  at least according to reich  who says  article iii section  of the constitution defines  treason against the united states  as  adhering to their enemies  giving them aid and comfort    reich argues that trump s apparent collusion with russians helped him win the election by my count  there are now four grounds to impeach trump  the fifth seems to be on its way  pic twitter com   robert reich   rbreich  march    isn t delusional enough to believe that impeachment will happen under the current gop congress  his goal is to flip the congress in   which means people have to stay engaged and stay aware  of course  that s why trump tries to delegitimize the media featured image via alex wong getty images
