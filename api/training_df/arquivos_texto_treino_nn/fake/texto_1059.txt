one would think that donald trump would ve learned his lesson by now and actually fact check what he is going to say in advance  but it turns out he hasn t  but then  when has donald trump or his supporters ever been concerned with technicalities such as facts case in point  trump told supporters at a rally in cedar rapids  iowa on wednesday night that immigrants who enter the united states should not be eligible for welfare benefits for five years  the time has come for new immigration rules which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years   trump told the raucous crowd at the u s  cellular center  adding that his administration would be  putting in legislation to that effect very shortly  that would definitely be a great idea  one of few positive moves the trump administration had made in their short time in power if it weren t for one small problem   the law  known as the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of   prwora  already exists the piece of legislation was passed by another member of his least favorite family  former president bill clinton  back in   under title iv of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act  entitled  restricting welfare and public benefits for aliens   section  clearly states that immigrants are not eligible for any federal means tested public benefit  for five years  starting on the date they first enter the country naturally  there are some exceptions to what constitutes  federal means tested public benefit  such as certain medical assistance  emergency disaster relief  and public health assistance for some vaccines  but the standard five year waiting period is quite clear instead of taking to twitter each time he goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night  maybe a better option for the president would be opening google or possibly even wikipedia and doing a little background research about what he plans to say next featured image via scott olson getty images
