if donald trump really cared about creating jobs and strengthening the economy he would not be trying to gut this small but critical program it s been around since   and it has greatly benefited coastal regions by generating tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars for the american economy every year while improving the safety and protection of our coastlines  and now it s being threatened by trump the sea grant program is part of the national oceanic and atmospheric association  the   million in funding helps   scientists around the country improve water quality  advise the fishing industry to keep it sustainable  and keep an eye on sea level rise that could drown coastal cities the program has been instrumental in the economic development of coastal regions  according to noaa  the tiny program generated   million in economic development and more than   jobs in  alone  in other words  this program has been a worthwhile investment for the government that has resulted in a huge return for the american people  if trump intends to continue to try to run the government like a business  gutting this program would be a terrible business decision trump has repeatedly claimed that he will create jobs in america  but cutting this program would do the exact opposite  it would also endanger every person who works and lives on or near a coastline climate change has caused sea levels to rise in recent years and the sea grant program helps scientists predict which parts of our coastlines need to prepare to prevent disaster slashing the program would make that work more difficult and trump s reason for considering the elimination of the program is galling  he wants to cut it and use the money to pay for an even more bloated defense budget  which is already so big that even if we cut it in half american would still spend more on the military than any other nation on earth in reaction to trump s plan  sea grant directors around the country expressed horror  my initial reaction was horror and disgust   california sea grant director jim eckman said   i think we re facing a much graver crisis that we re going to have to deal with  i have to assume there are some wise people in our congress who see the flaw   maine sea grant director paul anderson said of trump s plan   mr  trump is setting up for a political battle  indeed  the last time a republican president targeted sea grant there was a strong backlash in congress because the program does so much that benefits coastal economies and the environment  in   congress backed the sea grant program as ronald reagan sought to kill it  he backed down after an analysis showed that the  year    million investment in the program by the government yielded a return of over   billion  as noted earlier  in  the program created   jobs and over half a billion dollars in economic development  that s a single year of what this program has done  it s one of the most successful and beneficial government programs ever created and now trump wants to kill it last time i checked  there are several conservative states that have coastlines and those states have also greatly benefited from the sea grant program  so trump is not just hurting more liberal states by gutting this program  he is hurting people who voted for him and republicans featured image via jim lo   pool getty images
