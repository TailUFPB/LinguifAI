trump s selfishness knows no bounds  he thinks as president and commander in chief that he can do what he wants  and others will handle the details  there s one so called  detail   however  that he really needs to consider  all that time he spends at mar a lago  it s not just costing us a bundle  it s a national security nightmare that could be putting us in grave danger  and it grows with each visit mar a lago was not built for the u s  president  it was built as a resort for rich people like donald trump  the security risks are astonishing  especially since the guests who frequent the place get less vetting than what trump thinks syrian refugees get  that  according to former secret service agents and other experts  means spies and other enemies can get at him easily in fact  two former cia directors  michael hayden and john mclaughlin  both say that foreign intelligence operatives would love to get their hands on mar a lago  and it would be very easy because the place is so unsecure  they could eavesdrop on conversations and start building dossiers on key officials  and learn national secrets they could then use against us because trump was relaxed and stupid just look at what happened when one of his weekends in february turned into a national security event as north korea shot off a missile into the sea of japan  guests there were taking pictures of the briefings and discussions and posting them to social media in a massive breach of security  even though trump later insisted that no sensitive discussions took place  nor was sensitive material in view of his guests that s not all  though  all of trump s clubs present these risks because the members are welcome at mar a lago as he makes a habit of going there every single weekend  and they have access to him at his other clubs as well  that includes his international clubs  meaning foreigners have unsecure access to trump spies wouldn t even have to show up at mar a lago  or anywhere else  they could bribe or blackmail people close to trump to get intelligence on us  including key club employees whose names  email addresses and phone numbers are available on mar a lago s website  the club s managing director has special clearance to get close to trump  people in positions like that are juicy targets for spies it s not bad enough that trump insisted on using a personal  unsecure phone for a lot of his communications  including twitter  he has a secure phone now  but reports are conflicting about whether he still uses his old  unsecure android phone   he has make things worse by spending all his weekends at his estate  with people who worship him but could be anyone  or under anyone s influence basically  trump must have all his old habits and he doesn t give a damn about how unsecure they are  that means he doesn t give a damn about u s  national security  we have a man in the white house who s one of the worst security risks we ve had featured image by joe raedle via getty images
