donald trump is doing a horrendous job of raising his historically low approval rating in america  and it looks like he s not doing any better in trying to gain the approval and trust of the rest of the world thanks to a new survey by the pew research center  we can now rest assured that the entire world hates trump just as much as most americans do  the pew research center surveyed  countries  discovering that   of respondents stated that when it comes to international affairs  they have zero confidence that trump will respond appropriately or do the right thing this will be damaging enough to trump s ego  but it gets even worse for him  pew research center also reported that a similar survey was conducted on former president barack obama when he was potus  and it produced some very different results  that survey revealed that   of respondents had complete faith in obama on international affairs while the fact that most of the world hates trump is kind of hysterical  what it has done to america s reputation is quite depressing  the study revealed that america s reputation has declined dramatically since the days of obama  when respondents were asked how they felt about the u s   only   were favorable since trump got into the white house  which was a   decline from obama s time   and it s only been a few months  the authors of the survey said  in the eyes of most people surveyed around the world  the white house s new occupant is arrogant  intolerant and even dangerous  among the positive characteristics tested  his highest rating is for being a strong leader  fewer believe he is charismatic  well qualified or cares about ordinary people  ironically  the only two countries who reported to have more confidence in trump than obama were israel and  you guessed it russia  in fact  russia increased   thanks to trump s presidency  which should certainly raise some suspicion you can check out the findings below featured image via pool   getty images
