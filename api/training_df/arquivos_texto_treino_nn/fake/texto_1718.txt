yet another example of our airline industry s awesomeness occurred friday when an employee was captured on video challenging a passenger to a fight after a woman holding a baby was hit with her stroller  the video begins with the crying woman holding one of her children in her arms while begging for her stroller back one angry witness can be heard saying he s  not going to sit here and watch this  before going to the front of the plane to demand the name of the employee who hit the woman  another woman on the flight can be heard confronting the staff about their treatment of the latest victim of airline violence  much of the staff s conversation can not be heard from the vantage point of the person filming  but the gentleman who initially confronted the thugs on the plane stands up and says you do that to me and i ll knock you flat  you stay out of this   the male flight attendant shot back  try it  hit me  you don t know what the story is   but the passenger knew what the story is  the part that matters  anyway  i don t care what the story is  you almost hit that baby  fox spoke to some of the people aboard the plane  and the story is just as terrible as it seems olivia morgan was standing in the doorway of the aircraft with her  year old daughter waiting to board when the altercation happened  the flight attendant wrestled the stroller away from the woman  who was sobbing  holding one baby with the second baby in a car seat on the ground next to her   she said morgan said the flight attendant was  violent  when taking the metal stroller from the woman and nearly hit the baby with the stroller  he stormed by me with the stroller and i said something like   what are you doing  you almost hit that baby   and he yelled at me to  stay out of it   just like he does in the video   she said morgan said she talked to the woman about the incident  the woman said a female flight attendant told her she could look for space to store the stroller because it folds up very small  but if there was no available space  she would need to check it at the gate  she was looking for space when the male attendant tried to take it away from her  and she said she told him the other attendant had told her it was okay to look   she said according to the american airlines website  small strollers can be checked at the gate but there is no policy about strollers in the overhead bin  the lady and her two children were seated near the back of the plane  she was somehow able to get her stroller on board and back near her seat   said tom watson  who was sitting just behind the first class section when the staff went insane  she refused to let him take it and she was almost to the point of shouting  the flight attendant and the woman started making their way to the front of the plane  they were at the front of the plane near the crew area  the woman was holding on to the stroller and refusing to let go   he continued  adding that the flight attendant should not have been so aggressive and should have been more aware of the kids  he then says the woman was escorted off the plane fortunately  american airlines seems to have learned from united s numerous blunders following employees  assault on a doctor  rather than attempt to blame the woman  the company released a statement announcing that the employee has been suspended  not terminated though  we have seen the video and have already started an investigation to obtain the facts  what we see on this video does not reflect our values or how we care for our customers  we are deeply sorry for the pain we have caused this passenger and her family and to any other customers affected by the incident  we are making sure all of her family s needs are being met while she is in our care  after electing to take another flight  we are taking special care of her and her family and upgrading them to first class for the remainder of their international trip the actions of our team member captured here do not appear to reflect patience or empathy  two values necessary for customer care  in short  we are disappointed by these actions  the american team member has been removed from duty while we immediately investigate this incident the woman had to take another flight  but was given upgraded accommodations watch video shot directly following the attack below  featured image via screengrab
